At Earth, you might do something similar by using water as the tracer.\n\"We see the actual glow of the ammonia itself, and the variation in depth is correlated with brightness,\" explained Dr Wong.\n\"The deepest we can see in this dataset is about 12 Bar - 12 times the Earth's atmospheric pressure.\"\nPlumes of ammonia are observed to rise up in waves. The team writes in the journal Science that the ammonia in these plumes will eventually condense out at higher altitudes, and could explain the ammonia ice clouds detected by the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s.\n\"All told, there is a wealth of information about the structure of Jupiter's atmosphere in these new VLA images,\" said Imke de Pater, the lead author on the Science paper.\n\"We hope to resolve a number of outstanding questions with these and future studies using similar techniques.\" Prof de Pater wants to try similar observations at the gas giants Saturn and Uranus.\nThe research is a nice prelude to the next probe set to visit Jupiter: the US space agency satellite Juno arrives at the enormous planet on 4 July.\nIts remote sensing instruments aim to characterise the full internal structure of the planet, right down to its rocky core - if indeed it has one.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

After several months of training, \"pilots\" are said to be able to teach their brain how to think about moving a small circle on a computer screen either up or down, which in turn steers the drone left or right.\n\"We believe people will be able to pilot aircraft just like they perform everyday activities like walking or running,\" said Ricardo Mendes, Tekever's chief operating officer.\n\"We truly believe that Brainflight represents the beginning of a tremendous step change in the aviation field, empowering pilots and de-risking missions, and we're looking forward to deliver these benefits to the market with highly innovative products.\"\nIn the future, some of this technology may be put to use to control much larger aircraft, although Mr Mendes acknowledged considerable challenges with both regulatory hurdles and public confidence.\nThose concerns were echoed by John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant based in London.\n\"This to me is certainly at the moment a bridge too far,\" he told the BBC.\n\"You could get someone radically-minded who might say it, but I'd be surprised if anyone would do it.\"\nMr Strickland said the airline industry was instead focusing its innovation efforts towards things like better materials and more economical engines.\nMr Mendes said the technology would incorporate safety measures to counteract the effects of someone having, for example, a seizure while piloting.\n\"There are algorithms on board that prevent bad things from happening,\" he told the BBC.\nHe added: \"Technology is evolving, regulations are evolving.

Immigration and international affairs are both reserved powers.\"\nBefore the EU referendum in June, leading Brexit campaigner and then justice secretary Michael Gove had suggested Scotland could get powers over immigration as part of a deal to leave the EU.\nBut Mr Davis said: \"It's hard to see how a separate immigration policy would work.\"\nHe insisted the Brexit arrangements would be a \"United Kingdom deal\", rejecting the idea put forward by the Scottish Government that the country should be able to keep its place in the European single market.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said a referendum will be called if it is felt necessary to \"protect Scotland's interests\" in the wake of the Brexit vote.\nBut she has insisted her government was \"exploring all of the options\" for safeguarding Scotland's place in Europe, and has said she will publish proposals in the coming weeks for keeping Scotland in the European single market even if the UK leaves.\nAfter his first meeting with Mr Davis, Mr Russell said he expected to soon be able to announce a formal process for Scottish input into the Brexit process.\nSpeaking at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Mr Davis said while it has \"got to be a United Kingdom deal\", it would \"incorporate protection for the people of Scotland\".\nHe also said the eventual agreement would \"reflect the interests of the people of Scotland\".\nMr Davis stated: \"The aim is to get the maximum possible barrier-free access to the European Union market, as well as being able to get other markets globally.\n\"How we achieve that? We're not at that stage yet, but that's the aim.\"\nHe continued: \"I don't think the Scottish people want another referendum, but that's for them.\n\"I have simply got the single aim in front of me, which is to get the best deal possible, and that includes the best deal for the Scottish people.\"\nYesterday the Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, said that he thinks the United Kingdom might actually rein back on Brexit.\nMr Davis told BBC Scotland that is not the case: \"That's not going to happen. The prime minister has made clear that the now infamous phrase 'Brexit means Brexit' is going to happen.\n\"The people have given us an instruction, we have to carry it out.\"",

And do they carry Tasers?\nNick Beake: PC Keith Palmer was an unarmed officer protecting the Palace of Westminster, but Scotland Yard says he was wearing a protective vest at the time of the attack.\nThe force said during the post-mortem examination \"the pathologist could find no obvious evidence of damage or penetration other than the vest having been cut off during emergency first aid at the scene\".\nArmed officers working at Parliament carry a primary weapon, a sidearm and a Taser.\nAnd an unspecified number of armed response vehicles - three firearms specialists in an unmarked car - are on constant patrol in central London.\nWill the pavement safety barriers removed from nearby London Bridge be restored?\nNick Beake: The use of safety barriers varies from location to location.\nThe police, local authorities and transport bosses will all discuss where to install extra measures to protect the public.\nThe mayor of London's office says it is currently considering where more barriers could be installed.\nWhy not build a 6in [15cm] concrete barrier on the bridge pavements to protect pedestrians from the traffic?\nNick Beake: An independent review commissioned by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, last year recommended that more bollards be installed in busy parts of London to protect pedestrians from a Nice- or Berlin-style attack, where lorries were driven into crowds.\nThe report author, Lord Harris of Haringey, also called on the authorities to make more use of temporary barriers during big public events.\nWhat is the correct immediate response for members of the public caught up in this sort of attack?\nNick Beake: The current terrorist threat is rated as \"severe\", which means an attack is highly likely.\nThe latest advice from the government is to run away from the danger, hide if that is not possible, and then tell the authorities: \"Run, hide, tell.\"\nMore information can be found on the gov.uk website.\nWhat should we do if we see something suspicious?\nNick Beake: If you spot something suspicious, ring the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789 321. And call 999 if you think there is an immediate threat.\nHow do we know if something that seems suspicious is actually terrorism-related?\nNick Beake: It can be hard for experienced police and other investigators to establish quickly if a threat is terrorist-related, but the authorities would rather the public contact them with their genuine concerns however small they may be.

It is likely to take two more years for their numbers to recover, he added.\nHe also said the approximately 250 species of bees in the UK need high temperatures to gather nectar and pollen.\n\"We are seeing very low numbers of them now, as well as small bumble bees, which is a sign they haven't had enough nectar and pollen to feed on.\"\nBuglife says there is no specific data collated on various insect numbers, but that its volunteers and experts have been spotting numbers and will detect \"massive year-on-year variation\" which they have reported this year.\nHowever, some data is collated on butterfly numbers, and Mr Shardlow says that this year could see the lowest number of that insect ever recorded in the UK. Moths, too, are being seen in fewer numbers, he said.\nHowever, the wet weather has been good news for some insects, such as the crane fly, drone fly and mosquitoes as well as molluscs such as slugs and snails, which all thrive in the damp conditions.\n\"This means that anything which feeds on slugs and snails will also benefit this year,\" Mr Shardlow said.\n\"We've had reports of large numbers of glow worms, for example, which feed on slugs and snails.\"\nBut Richard Ridler, chairman of Essex Beekeepers' Association, says this year's bad weather has not necessarily killed off bees, just stopped them from venturing out into fields and gardens.\n\"The problem was that we had an appalling start to the year, which meant the bees stayed at home. Instead of going out, they stayed in their hives and ate their honey. I've had 25% of the honey yield that I would have expected this year.\n\"So the public saw a lot less of them.

At home in the workplace and in schools, declaring a belief in traditional marriage should always be permitted and respected.\"\nIn England and Wales, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act was passed into law in July.\nIt is expected that the first gay and lesbian wedding ceremonies will take place by summer next year when the relevant statutory orders have been put in place.\nThe act will allow religious organisations to \"opt in\" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales being banned in law from doing so.",

A number of other people were also injured.\nThe Haqqani network has been described by US military commanders as one of the most resilient militant groups operating in Afghanistan.\nThe troubled border region is a known stronghold for al-Qaeda and Taliban militants.\nSeven people were killed in a similar strike on 8 June, also in North Waziristan, just three days after the new prime minister was sworn in.\nAfter that incident the Pakistani government summoned a senior US diplomat in protest, condemning what it called a \"violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity\".\nAt least two key leaders of the Pakistani Taliban have been killed in earlier US drone strikes this year. Mullah Nazir was killed in January and Waliur Rehman was killed in May, shortly after Mr Sharif swept to election victory.\nThe BBC's Richard Galpin in Islamabad says that the latest air strike by US forces will further heighten tensions between Washington and the new Pakistani government.\nMr Sharif has called for a joint strategy to stop US drone strikes. The issue is hugely controversial in Pakistan, where parts of the government and military have often been accused of criticising the use of drones in public, but co-operating in private.\nDrone strikes are a source of severe tension between the US and Pakistan.\nIt is estimated that between 2004 and 2013, CIA drone attacks in Pakistan killed up to 3,460 people.\nAbout 890 of them were civilians and the vast majority of strikes were carried out by the Obama administration, research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism said.\nEarlier this year, Mr Obama called the strikes part of a legitimate campaign against terrorism, but he also pledged more programme transparency and stricter targeting rules.",

Too bad!\"\nMrs Murkowski was one of two Republicans earlier on Tuesday to vote against allowing the debate on healthcare legislation reform to go forward.\nBut her party eked out a victory after Vice President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote which allowed discussion to take place.\nSenator John McCain, who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour, received a standing ovation as he returned to Congress to cast his \"Yes\" vote.\nPresident Trump tweeted his thanks to the Arizona senator for playing \"such a vital role\" in the vote.",

Hands were raised looking for an offside flag but the on-loan Swindon Town man focused on the task of hitting a shot goal-ward and in it went off the far post from a tight angle.\nThe Firhill crowd got even more uneasy when Roberts' close-range effort hit the post following good set-up play by Mbuyi-Mutombo, then Partick goalkeeper Ryan Scully had to pull off a great stop to deny Storey getting his second of the afternoon.\nWhen Roberts' low drive narrowly missed the target moments later, the home support unleashed a barrage of boos.\nMeekings did not miss, however. His controlled side-foot finish from Greg Tansey's corner made it three and very, very easy for Inverness.\nDoolan did eventually manage to reduce the deficit, rounding Fon Williams after his initial effort was saved, but it did not take long for the visitors to restore their three-goal lead.\nRichie Foran - who has had so many injury problems over the last two years - came on as a substitute and delivered a cross for Roberts to slam home at the back post and remind everyone which team had been in complete control.",

But the BBC's Wyre Davies put the turnout at 10,000 people, which he said was the biggest protest seen in Jordan for several years.\nVideo footage showed protesters chanting slogans and waving flags. The AFP news agency quoted people as shouting: \"We demand constitutional reform before the people revolt. The people want to reform the regime.\"\nA counter-rally, in support of King Abdullah, which organisers had predicted would attract 200,000 supporters, was cancelled late on Thursday in order to prevent clashes between the two groups.\nEarlier, police said they had detained eight people travelling towards the rally and had seized three vehicles containing sticks, knives and guns.\nFriday's protest in the capital and the dissolution of parliament come amid mounting opposition anger at the electoral law passed in July by the government of the conservative Prime Minister Fayez al-Tarawneh.\nThe electoral law increased the number of seats in the House of Representatives from 120 to 150 seats and gave the electorate two votes - one for a district representative and one for national level lists that include political parties - replacing the single non-transferable vote.\nThe IAF's leader, Hamza Mansour, dismissed the legislation as \"just a cosmetic change meant to buy time and insufficient for real reforms\".\nOpposition parties demanded that 50% of seats be allocated to party lists, but the new electoral law gave them just 27 seats, or 18%.\nThey also complained that the new law would strengthen supporters of the king by allocating three more seats for women from Bedouin districts.\nThis, they argued, would continue to marginalise Jordanians of Palestinian origin - who make up 60% of the population but have little political power - in favour of those descended from Jordan's original Bedouin inhabitants - whose tribes dominate the government and security forces and are the bedrock of the Hashemite monarchy.\nTraditionally, many of the IAF's supporters have been Jordanians of Palestinian origin.\nThe opposition also demanded that parliament, rather than the king, should have the right to appoint and dismiss the prime minister.\nDespite the call for reforms, Jordan has so far avoided the unrest and political upheaval that rocked much of the Arab world last year. Protests have been relatively small and have not gained the same level of political momentum as those in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria.\nCorrection 25 January 2013: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that members of the Jordanian security forces were allowed to vote for the first time.",

It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.\n\"For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs.\"\nAmong the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg.\nRussia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov.\nPanellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde.\nUnder the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it.\nCampaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions.\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit.\"\nRobert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: \"The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come.\n\"What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions\".",

But she claimed that the \"British values\" requirement was opposed to this.\nDarul Uloom, now rated as inadequate, had been inspected by Ofsted inspectors since 2011. In October 2013, Ofsted rated it as good and described the head teacher as \"forward thinking\".\nOfsted says that although its own inspectors carried out a number of inspections in recent years, the school was considered to have been part of the BSI inspection system.\nAmong the 22 schools inspected 15 were Muslim and seven Christian.\nThey had been part of a group of about 50 private schools which had been assessed by the Bridge Schools Inspectorate, which now is no longer approved to inspect schools.\nAmong the 22 schools inspected by Ofsted, one was \"outstanding\", four were rated \"good\", eight were rated as \"requires improvement\" and nine were \"inadequate\".\nSir Michael's letter to the education secretary says it should be a priority to inspect other former Bridge Schools Inspectorate schools.",

Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. \"We welcome it, we are ready for it,\" he said. \"We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary.\" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. \"A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people\". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. \"We had an agreement with the crown prince,\" he said. \"The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue.\" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was \"hopeful\" that he would \"do more than his predecessor\", Hillary Clinton. \"US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more.\" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. \"If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. \"It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. \"So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy.\" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for \"peaceful demonstrations\", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. \"It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government.\" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. \"These people have a lot of followers in the street.  If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail.\"",

It added his funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date. Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement. The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US. \"Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,\" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said. \"He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director.\" The AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: \"I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing.

As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved.

Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: \"The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. \"Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. \"Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" Mr Kirby said, admitting that \"this is not a decision that was taken lightly\". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: \"We regret this decision by Washington.\" \"Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. \"After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,\" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel \"that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre\". However, the two sides would keep talking about counter-terrorism operations in Syria to avoid unnecessary clashes.",

    "document": "Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but \"driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be \"less of it\". \"The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. \"People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This is something that councils can choose to do already. \"Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. \"They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. \"If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.\" But Labour said the coalition's \"failed\" polices were \"making the housing crisis worse not better\". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: \"Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and \"put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. \"Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. \"That seems fairer to me,\" he added. The think tank also said the move would be \"extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be \"cleansed\" of \"hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices\". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced \"radical reforms\" to \"get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme \"set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes\". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure \"social housing goes to those in greatest need\", he added.",

    "document": "Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months. It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a \"similar location and mechanism\", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as \"fracking\", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: \"We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts. \"We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that.\" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: \"Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes. \"It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.\" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: \"The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde. \"Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site. \"Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles). \"The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.\"",

He was cleared of the two other counts by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court.

In his defence, Carpenter - who usually wears a kilt and piper's regalia when he performs - said he had piped for the charity in the past but on this occasion he was simply busking. Kenneth Derbyshire, chairman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said he had given Carpenter permission to design and display a banner featuring the eternal flame and the word justice.

Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner. Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry's corner against the post late on. Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies. The Rs have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road, and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway's second game in charge. The win lifted Mick McCarthy's Ipswich up four places to 14th and above Rangers, who slipped to 15th. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: \"The irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did. He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline, but I'll take three. \"With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas, I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren't thinking that when they saw the teamsheet.

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new \"subject\" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. \"In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,\" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed \"at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',\" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov.

    "document": "It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver \"championships, plural\", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

Am I right? If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online: Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker. \"There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,\" he says. \"The chat room is like the foyer of a church.\" Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included: Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons. \"We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,\" says Mr Parker. \"The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.\" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. \"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says. \"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. \"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world.\" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. \"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. \"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious\". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. \"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal. \"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. \"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. \"I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,\" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. \"The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.\" \"Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,\" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. \"He was a great communicator.\" Sounds like a seal of approval to me.",

Novaya Gazeta says it amounts to a call for \"reprisals against journalists\". \"We urge the Russian authorities to do everything possible to prevent actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards journalists, who are doing their professional duty,\" the paper said. On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed. The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. \"All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya. Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them \"lies\". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that \"retribution\" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April. \"There will be retribution!\" he told the Russian news website RBC. \"Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.\" Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya. \"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue. Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova. But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya. The LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses. If Russia fails to prosecute anyone, it says it will file a case at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.",

    "document": "Investing Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men. The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\". Investing Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. \"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\".",

    "document": "The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: \"I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. \"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.\" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision. McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says he studied a \"litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \"several reasons to approve the fight\". Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. \"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. \"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer. \"Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself. \"That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\" McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: \"He's good to go.\" He also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said he oversaw an \"out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.",

    "document": "Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a \"very, very important place\" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, \"the Street of Shame\" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. \"I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. \"I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'.\" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. \"There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying.\" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. \"The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time.\" His memories of the street in its heyday are of \"watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers\". \"Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago.\" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of \"certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then\". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. \"At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,\" he says. \"The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards.\" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there. \"Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street. \"But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street. \"When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one. \"Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm. \"The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. \"At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool. \"I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him. \"He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'\" But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the \"Stab in the Back\" is a Pizza Express. Now a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline. \"As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,\" says Mr Smith. \"It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history.\"",

    "document": "It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: \"Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. \"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. \"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\" A Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. \"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"",

Production has been boosted by better than expected sales of the Hawick Knitwear-branded range which launched in January. The company, which dates back to 1874, was bought by managing director Benny Hartop in November last year. As well as the new range, the firm has seen growth of its longer-established business of supplying customers who sell the garments under their private labels. In Europe, Hawick Knitwear sells into Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Italy and Spain. Markets outside Europe include the USA, Canada, Mexico, and Japan. The knitwear firm has increased its production to 9,500 sweaters each week, from about 7,500 last year, to keep up with demand. Mr Hartop said: \"The increase in production is in direct response to a surge in orders from both home and abroad for our private label clients and now for our own brand too. \"There will always be challenges but thankfully our future is looking very good and this is a testament to the dedicated staff working at all levels of the business. \"I have no doubt this success will continue for us into the future.\"",

Brian Wright, 55, of Kempston, told Luton Crown Court he had been blinded by the setting sun. He accepted he had struck Mrs Blackburn but denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Mrs Blackburn is now being treated in residential care. Judge Michael Kay QC paused the case for five minutes so Mr Wright could compose himself after he told the court how he had turned his victim's \"world upside down\". Mr Wright said: \"I understand Sylvia was a much-loved lollipop lady, who was loved by the children. \"I am truly sorry for what I have done to her and her family.\" Mr Wright's VW Golf failed to stop for a red light, the jury heard. The married mother-of-three, a lollipop lady for 20 years, had been on duty in Bedford Road as pupils left school. When the traffic lights turned red, Mrs Blackburn, who was wearing appropriate clothing, stepped out to escort a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road. Prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod said traffic in the other direction had stopped, but the defendant did not, and hit her. Mr Wright, of The Dell, said he could not remember if the traffic lights were red or green. \"I was totally blinded by the sun,\" he said. \"I just heard a bump.

    "document": "It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters. It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences. For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves. U33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships. Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training \"focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare\". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: \"I wouldn't want to comment on that,\" before adding: \"In general, we're always on the lookout.\" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the \"quietest submarine in the world\". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world\". When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and \"fingerprinting\" other nations' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named \"Dynamic Mongoose\", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters. RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a \"key vulnerability\". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, he says, should be \"exceptionally worried\" that it is seen as a \"soft touch\", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare. But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",

    "document": "United Nations officials rarely use the words \"genocide\" and \"ethnic cleansing,\" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. \"They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,\" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. \"They don't want us,\" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. \"These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them.\" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.\"We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,\" he said. \"It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.\" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. \"This has been unrelenting since July,\" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. \"The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides.\" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. \"War, war, war,\" she began, \"who are you and where do you come from?\" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. \"You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan.\" There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people.

    "document": "Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. \"I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,\" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. \"DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. \"We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the \"genocide\" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is \"We won't forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.\" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

And she was again visibly emotional after Mr Salmond told the chamber: \"It's goodbye from me... for now\". Ms Marwick, Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May. Mr Salmond, who served as first minister between 2007 and 2014, used his valedictory address to repeat a belief he expressed in his very first speech in the parliament that Scotland was \"not divided, but diverse\". He said both the country and parliament were on a journey, and added: \"Yes we are a country of different views, but we are not divided. There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland. \"And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that\". He welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign. There were lighters moments as Mr Salmond, who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget, joked that he was aware that he faced competition from a \"major attraction down south today\". He then added: \"However, on balance, I feel that the champion chase at Cheltenham racecourse will not be overshadowed by my remarks.\" And the former SNP leader joked that he wished everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck, \"albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm\". He concluded his address by saying: \"Let me leave you with these final thoughts - there is no greater honour in public life than to be a member of this parliament. \"There is no greater task than to mould the public purpose of Scotland. There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country. \"And so with that it is goodbye from me... for now\". Ms Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that he had \"served the parliament and Scotland with distinction\". The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it was established in 1999. Mr McNeil used his address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system. He said: \"It will be this parliament's responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary. \"We must ensure we are capable of meeting that challenge, or we will face the consequences.\" He recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster. But Mr McNeil said: \"It saddens me to say we now have to do a bit of learning from them and how they run their business.\" Former Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood. In her speech, she joked she would miss her dealings with Finance Secretary John Swinney, especially \"his huge outbursts of faux indignation\".",

    "document": "Matching Models in London describes itself as \"an international temp agency for beautiful and talented people\". It advertised for a personal assistant with \"a classic look, brown long hair with b-c cup\". The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) called it \"appalling, unlawful and demeaning to women\". Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the EHRC, said it would be writing to Matching Models \"asking for them to clarify their hiring practices immediately\". Meanwhile, women's equality campaigners said its ads were \"straight out of the 1970s\". Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: \"It is extraordinary that they are taking this approach and almost certainly falls foul of equality legislation. \"If we ever wonder why the battle for gender equality hasn't been won, this is a timely reminder.\" The agency's founder Nathalie Jansen said: \"Our clients are important to us - and looks are important.\" Another job advert on the agency's website asks a \"sexy female driver\" to drive a Porsche Cayenne two days a week for between £40,000 and £50,000-a-year for a Knightsbridge-based businessman and polo team owner. Employment lawyer James Lynas, partner at Winckworth Sherwood, said the advert was \"clearly unlawful\", adding anyone could complain to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who have powers to intervene. He said an employment tribunal could find the use of phrases such as \"beautiful and attractive\" were really code for \"young\", and in reality discriminatory against older women. He added: \"A male driver who genuinely wanted the job could submit an application and sue for sex discrimination if rejected. Compensation for such claims is unlimited. \" A statement on the agency's website states: \"It is almost politically incorrect to request someone to work for you that is both attractive as well as professionally equipped with the right set of skills. \"However, our company understands the importance of having the right people representing your company, because after all, first impressions count.\" But Ms Hilsenrath said: \"Matching Models are right about one thing; first impressions count, but the important stuff is not about your hair colour. \"If they wish to maintain their reputation, they should act like a business in the 21st Century and consign this type of sexism to the history books.\" Under the 2010 Equality Act, it is against the law to say, or imply, that you will discriminate against anyone - including saying that you are unable to cater for disabled workers. Employers are also not allowed to question a candidate's age, sexual orientation, marital status, number of children or plans to have children, disability, race or religion. As for specifying clothing sizes, an employer has to be able to show that it is essential to the nature or context of the work. Talking about the personal assistant advert, Ms Jansen said: \"The client who wants the specific cup size is an older gentleman - he has a specific outfit he designed with Christian Dior. He wants a \"Jackie O\" look. And he wants a lady with a smaller cup size to fit into the outfit.\" \"I recently had an Indian businessman who interviewed 60 women from my firm. He wanted a blonde, blue eyed, Greek woman. He hired 6 of them to work on his plane.\" Matching Models clients include MTV, Louis Vuitton, Coca-Cola, the Renualt Formula 1 team and Harrods. Ms Jansen said she had hired 5,000 people worldwide and pointed out MTV wanted models with tattoos and piercings.",

    "document": "A journalist and stock market officials are among those arrested, Xinhua said. It gave no other details. Chinese shares fell by nearly 8% after a week of volatile trading that spread fear to global markets. The Tianjin explosions killed 150 people - with 23 still missing. A total of 367 people remain in hospital after the 12 August blast at a warehouse where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored. Twenty are in critical condition, according to Xinhua. Separately, the UK's Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mishandled their stock market rescue efforts. The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of \"destabilising the market\". Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours. The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said. The news agency said \"seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II\" were also among the offences. A journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials, according to a Xinhua report. The journalist, Wang Xiaolu, is accused of \"spreading fake information\" about the market slump, the report said. The state news agency said Mr Wang confessed that he \"wrote fake report on Chinese stock market based on hearsay and his own subjective guesses without conducting due verifications\". In 2013 Chinese authorities introduced a possible three-year sentence for spreading rumours - the sentence was supposed to apply to anyone who posted a rumour that was reposted 500 times or viewed 5,000 times. Last year, Qin Zhihui, a blogger, was sentenced to three years in a government crackdown on internet rumours. Mr Qin was found guilty of \"slander\" and \"picking quarrels and provoking troubles\", state broadcaster CCTV said at the time.",

The US Open champion fell on the stairs and hurt his lower back on Wednesday. \"I'm playing the best golf of my life and to have a freak accident happen yesterday afternoon, it sucks really bad,\" said Johnson. \"I have been worked on all morning and obviously I can take some swings, but I can't swing full, I can't make my normal swing and I didn't think there was any chance I could compete.\" The 15-time PGA Tour winner added: \"I was wearing socks and slipped and went down the three stairs. The left side of my lower back took the brunt of it and my left elbow is bruised as well.\" Johnson's caddie was placing the ball on his tee for him on the range, while coach Butch Harmon said pain hindered Johnson's rest overnight. Shortly before his withdrawal, he progressed from hitting wedge shots on the range to fuller swings and his involvement looked likely as he made his way to the first tee for a scheduled 19:03 BST start alongside playing partners Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker. Johnson was a popular pick to win the first major of the year as a result of the fine form he has shown in 2017. He has won the past three tournaments in which he has competed - February's Genesis Open, and both the WGC Mexico Championship and WGC Dell Match Play in March. As well as winning last year's US Open by four shots, he finished ninth at the Open Championship and tied fourth at the Masters. BBC Radio 5 live correspondent Iain Carter Johnson took until the very last second to make what must have been an agonising decision to pull out. He was standing on the first tee before making the toughest call of his career. It is a severe blow for the player who has dominated golf this season.

It was due for release in Malaysia on Thursday, but Disney said it was being held for a \"review\" of its content. The Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) said on Tuesday it had approved the screening but with \"a minor edit concerning a gay moment in the film\". Homosexual activity is illegal in Muslim majority Malaysia, although the country's tourism minister has said banning the film is \"ridiculous\". A new release date has yet to be announced.   The live-action remake was granted a \"P13 parental guidance classification\". \"We have approved the film so there is no more issue. Once a film receives approval, it means it can be screened,\" LPF Chairman Datuk Abdul Hamid said. \"However, the date of screening and where the screening takes place is not under LPF's jurisdiction. We only look at the content and give a decision on whether the movie gets approved or not.\" Local cinema chains have been offering refunds for customers who have purchased tickets in advance. Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon has spoken about the \"exclusively gay moment\" in the film. It involves LeFou - the sidekick of the film's main antagonist Gaston - who tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story. The decision to review the Disney classic in Malaysia courted criticism from netizens, many of whom called it \"stupid and laughable\". \"Malaysia bans 'Beauty and the Beast' but is okay with nonsense Malay movies with no moral values, just full of brainless jokes,\" wrote a Twitter user in a tweet which drew more than 4,500 re-tweets.

It is a key element of a package of reforms promised by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. The law seeks to end Italy's post-war era of revolving governments, political horse-trading and unstable coalitions. The lower house of parliament gave final approval to the bill by 334 votes to 61. The proportional election system awards 340 out of 630 seats to any party that wins more than 40% of the national vote. If no party reaches that threshold, there is a second-round run-off between the two parties with the most votes. The electoral reform is expected to come into force next year. After the vote, Mr Renzi said: \"Commitment achieved, promise respected. Italy needs people who don't always say no.\" Critics have accused the 40-year-old former mayor of Florence who became prime minster last year of trying to consolidate his grip on power. They complain that the law awards too much power to single parties, gives party bosses too much scope to select candidates, and denies voters the chance to directly choose representatives. Opposition parties boycotted Monday's vote. Renato Brunetta, parliamentary head of centre-right opposition party Forza Italia, said afterwards that it was \"a very ugly day for our country's democracy\". Mr Renzi wants to further transform the Italian system by abolishing the Senate and replacing it with a non-elected body with lesser powers.

But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month. Adminstrators Begbies Traynor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire. The Art Fund, which led the campaign, will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum. Administrator Bob Young said it had been \"incredibly satisfying\" to sign off on the sale on Monday. \"Today's fantastic outcome wouldn't have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations,\" he said. The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc's pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009. In 2010 the museum also went into administration, and in 2011 a high court judge ruled its collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund. Alison Wedgwood, whose husband Tom is a direct descendant of company founder Josiah Wedgwood, said the collection was \"important\" for Staffordshire. The collection risked being \"sold and scattered around the globe\" had the money not been raised, she added.

He called for more international financial support to help build schools and train teachers. \"The alternatives are very bad,\" said Mr Thneibat. \"The international community will pay a high price if we don't stand together to face this serious problem,\" he told the Global Education and Skills Forum. Mr Thneibat said Jordan already had Palestinian and Iraqi refugees and now had 1.3 million Syrians who had fled across its borders. \"We're trying to do everything to educate these young people for peace, introducing ideas of tolerance and co-existence,\" Mr Thneibat, who is also Jordan's education minister, told the international conference in Dubai. But he warned that Syria's neighbours did not have the capacity to deal with such an influx of families without more international assistance. He said Jordan was training thousands more teachers and building new schools, which would operate in double shifts to try to accommodate 145,000 refugee children in its state school system. But there were still more children arriving than could be taught, he warned. There had been financial support from the international community - and more had been pledged, Mr Thneibat said - but almost two-thirds of the cost of each extra refugee pupil was being taken from Jordan's own education budget, he said. This was in addition to extra costs in health, housing and infrastructure. Without any access to education, he said such youngsters could become part of another cycle of conflict. \"If we leave these students, we believe they could become extremists.\" Tom Fletcher, UK ambassador to Lebanon until last year, said the numbers of refugees were now \"staggering\". Mr Fletcher is now working for a coalition trying to get business support to tackle the refugee crisis. He said conventional humanitarian crisis approaches did not work on this scale, and that other groups, including business, should contribute. George Papendreou, former prime minister of Greece, told the conference that he had been a refugee when his family was in political exile. He said that European countries should try to see refugees as potential benefits to their societies rather than respond with \"fear and ignorance\".",

McIlroy, 27, has never finished worse than 11th in his seven appearances at Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai. Westwood, meanwhile, carded seven birdies and just one bogey in his 66. The 43-year-old Englishman found out earlier this week he would not be competing in the World Cup in Melbourne next week. Westwood's partner Danny Willett pulled out because of a back problem, and his place went to Chris Wood. Under tournament rules, Wood was able to select his own partner and opted for Andy Sullivan. \"I'm disappointed not to be playing,\" said Westwood. \"I can understand him picking a mate and he has picked a very good player. It is probably more to do with the rules than anything.\" The Tour Championship is the final event of the Race to Dubai, with four players still in with a chance of topping the European Tour Order of Merit. Henrik Stenson, holder of a course-record 25 under at the Earth Course, leads but Willett can leapfrog the Swede should he win the tournament. Willett would also top the list if he finishes second and neither Stenson nor Alex Noren win in Dubai. Noren, another Swede, needs to finish at least second and hope Stenson and Willett finish down the field. McIlroy has an outside chance which requires several permutations falling into place - including Stenson finishing no higher than 46th in the 60-man field. It took McIlroy 14 holes to register his first birdie of the day, and although he swiftly added another on the next, the four-time major winner double-bogeyed the 16th after needing two attempts - the second minus his right shoe and sock - to play from the edge of a water hazard.

East Sussex's fire authority said it would co-operate with the PCC but it believed collaboration could be achieved without elaborate structural change. Ms Bourne said she had written to WSCC leader Louise Goldsmith and Phil Howson, East Sussex Fire Authority chairman, to request they begin to look at the feasibility of bringing both fire services under her authority. \"Just as we have one police force that effectively manages the county, we need to understand if one fire service not two could achieve the same,\" she said. Ms Bourne's letter met with cross-party opposition from WSCC. And Ms Goldsmith also invited the home secretary to visit West Sussex and see an alternative to the government's preferred plan. Ms Goldsmith said West Sussex fire service was already integrated within the council and served communities. She added last year's Shoreham air disaster showed how West Sussex emergency services already worked together. East Sussex Fire Authority said it was willing to co-operate with the PCC to determine whether proposals could improve delivery of services and create efficiencies. In a statement, it added: \"[The fire authority] believes whilst close collaboration between the emergency services is essential, it can be achieved without elaborate structural change. \"It is also the fire authority's considered view that it is more accountable to the community it serves because its members are elected councillors.\"",

    "document": "The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was \"promising\", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: \"The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.\"",

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,\" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.

He said he had already won backing from Poland that it would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights. The EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as a higher education law. Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros. Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months. Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would backtrack on any of the three issues, Mr Szijjarto answered: \"No. Why should we? \"These laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues.\" The minister added that \"my Polish colleague\" had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary. EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously. Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports. Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers, raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law.

    "document": "They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy \"sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment\". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as \"sexier\" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. \"There's a huge market for our timber. Every saw miller tells me he would double or treble production if the timber was there to feed that mill,\" he added.",

He told ABC News he would try not to hit balls into the water in future. Crocodiles are a common sight on the golf course, Australian media reported, and signs warn players of the dangers. Police Senior Sergeant James Coate told ABC that the 1.2m (4ft) saltwater crocodile had been in a waterway on the 11th hole Mr Lahiff, speaking from Cairns Hospital, said he had seen crocodiles there before and \"should have realised to be a bit more aware\". \"I didn't see the croc sunbaking just on the edge of the water. I walked past it and then it got me on the way back and as soon as it grabbed me it took off into the water.\" He manage to drive himself back to the club house to get help. The Australian newspaper reported that wildlife officers would try to remove the crocodile and relocate it to a crocodile farm or a zoo. But Mr Lahiff told ABC he wanted the croc to stay where it was. \"I think he got more of a fright than me. He's alright,\" he said. The Palmer Sea Reef golf course is owned by Australian billionaire and politician Clive Palmer. After the incident he tweeted that he wished the golfer a speedy recovery. He joked: \"Crocodile has been removed from all menus at Palmer properties following today's incident.\" Crocodiles are a common feature of Australia's tropical north and numbers have increased since being declared a protected species in 1971.",

Bidders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships. The BBC understands no proposals to preserve the ships have been submitted. Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March. A final decision is not expected until the spring. The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field. Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said it was important UK recyclers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrapyard. She added: \"For anyone that has served on a ship it's your home, you've literally been through the wars with it... and you want them to have a noble second life. \"My preference is to go for the reef and diving attraction. \"We've got to get best value for the budget but a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism.\" The Ministry of Defence has previously said it will \"consider all options\" for the frigates to ensure \"best financial return for the taxpayer\". A spokeswoman would not comment on the number or nature of the bids received due to \"commercial sensitivity\". Originally designed as a specialist anti-submarine ship, the Type 22 frigate evolved into a powerful surface combatant with substantial anti-surface, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons systems. They were also known for having excellent command and control, and communication facilities, making them ideal flagships on deployments, with a complement of about 280 crew.

    "document": "The man is said to have been trying to gather details about a German parliamentary committee that is investigating claims of US espionage. German authorities have asked the US ambassador for \"swift clarification\". The US National Security Agency (NSA) was last year accused of bugging the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel as part of a huge surveillance programme. The scale of the agency's global spy programme was revealed in documents leaked last year by a former intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden. The revelations about the NSA put a strain on ties between Germany and the US and raised feeling in Germany against American surveillance. The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin says the new allegation of American spying on an ally may make it harder for the US to get German help in its efforts to oppose Russian activity in Ukraine, and also to control Iranian nuclear ambitions. German media say the man arrested this week is a 31-year-old employee of the federal service, the BND or Bundesnachrichtendienst. The German federal prosecutor's office confirmed the man's arrest, but gave no other details. A spokesman for Ms Merkel said she had been informed of the arrest, as had the members of the nine-strong parliamentary committee investigating the activities of foreign intelligence agencies in Germany. \"The matter is serious, it is clear,\" spokesman Steffen Seibert told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, Der Spiegel news magazine said the man was believed to have passed secret documents to a US contact in exchange for money. However, one unnamed politician told Reuters news agency the suspect had offered his services to the US voluntarily. \"This was a man who had no direct contact with the investigative committee... He was not a top agent,\"   the source said. Germany is particularly sensitive to reports of espionage on its territory because many of its citizens from the formerly communist east of the country were spied upon by the Stasi secret police.",

Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas. Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular. Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches. (% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable) England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else. Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: \"Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate. \"School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet.\" Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: \"Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged. \"From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat. \"School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety.\" School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines. About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools. More children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46%.

Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said:  \"The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. \"We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable.\" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining \"high quality care for local people\" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: \"People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance. \"We have launched this investigation to find out more about the financial situation at the trust and to establish what can be done to improve things.\"",

Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: \"Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. \"Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. \"The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. \"But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs.\" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: \"We are all gutted.

It is part of a social media campaign supporting 13-year-old Joshua Martin, from Donaghadee, County Down. Life took a dramatic turn for the teenager when he was diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Eve. He was due to have an operation on his appendix at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. However, doctors instead discovered and removed a large primary cancer and five smaller growths. The news shocked Josh's family, but since his diagnosis they have received lots of support from people all over the world. It began as a hashtag on Facebook and Instagram by Bangor Elim Church, where Josh's father is on the pastoral staff, and has since gone viral. The church's senior pastor, Gary Beattie, said he was amazed by how many people have supported Josh and his family so far. \"We were in total shock when he was diagnosed, and really the family just wanted support from people and to ask people to pray for Josh,\" Gary said. \"It certainly isn't a campaign as such, we just put the hashtag on our Facebook posts to get some of our congregation thinking about him. We had no idea that it would take off. \"We would use social media quite a lot because we have quite a young congregation, and we've been posting updates about Josh from his family. \"The update was shared 948 times and it's been seen by over 79,000 people. It's absolutely phenomenal. \"We thought there had been a mistake, but you can look at the views and where they've come from, and there are people all over the world supporting him, which is great.\" But how did a social media hashtag lead to the appearance of the massive billboard? Gary said that last week a mystery donor paid for the sign and it was erected at Holywood playing fields. \"We do not know where it came from, we didn't put it there, but it means a lot to have such support,\" Gary said. There has also been a huge outpouring of support on Twitter for the Bangor Grammar pupil, with his classmates using the now-global hashtag for their friend. As Josh's family and friends continue to support him in his recovery, it now seems there will be people all over the world will be following suit, thanks to the kindness of County Down strangers.",

He was involved in repeated family dramas including having an affair with his brother's wife, Kathy, and having his brother go on to marry his ex-wife Sharon. \"Grant Mitchell is an EastEnders legend and finally he is returning home to Walford to say goodbye to his mother and be reunited not just with his old loves but also his brother,\" said EastEnders executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins. \"To have the Mitchell brothers come face to face again, having to face losing their mother, is an opportunity to show Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden at their very best.\"",

Phillips played for the St Louis Rams, Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers until 1999, but he was plagued by trouble on and off the field. After his NFL career, Phillips continued to have problems with the law. Eventually, he was sent to prison after being convicted of assault for driving his car into a group of teenagers. In another case, he was convicted of assaulting a former girlfriend. Phillips, who was serving a term of more than 30 years, had been placed in a cell alone after he was accused of killing his former cellmate. On Tuesday, a judge found that there was enough evidence to try Phillips in the death of Damion Soward, 37.

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.",

The minister allayed fears about job losses in a letter to Swansea East AM Mike Hedges. Mr Hedges said the minister's response would \"give comfort\" to DVLA employees. Concerns over the future of some of the 5,000 workers at the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency centre were raised in October after Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement. The chancellor announced that the tax disc would be replaced with an electronic system in October 2014. The new system will allow people to pay the charge by monthly direct debit. Mr Hedges had written to Mr Hammond asking for clarification of the government's intentions. In his response to Mr Hedges, Mr Hammond said: \"It is likely that the introduction of a direct debit scheme may mean there will be a natural reduction in the amount of refunds received, in addition to the withdrawal of the tax disc. \"This may mean changes to job roles and the need to train on new processes. \"Any reductions in numbers of people needed for these activities will be managed through redeploying to other growth areas of the business.\" Mr Hedges welcomed the minister's assurances. He added: \"Whilst disappointed that the changes will reduce the number of job opportunities at the DVLA, I can see the advantages of both paying by monthly direct debits and not having to show a tax disc. \"I am pleased the minister is committed to redeployment rather than redundancies and I am sure this response will give comfort to many concerned DVLA employees.\"",

Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One. A service was also held at Westminster Abbey. The national anthems of New Zealand and Australia were sung as the service ended. The first time Anzac Day was commemorated in the capital was when King George V attended a Westminster Abbey service in 1916, a year after the Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) landings at Gallipoli. Since then, the services have become an important moment for thousands of expatriate and visiting New Zealanders and Australians, who honour the sacrifices of their countrymen and women in all wars. Addressing the crowds at the dawn service, Alexander Downer, Australian high commissioner to the UK, who also laid a wreath, said: \"When we reflect on Anzac Day we imagine the Gallipoli landings, what it must have been like, at dawn on the water, in sight of that rugged shoreline - and a collectively held breath, a leaden silence about to be broken. \"We consider the enthusiasm, the courage, and the heroism of the Anzac troops - ordinary men fighting for God, King and empire, for their mates, for adventure, for a world without war.\" Members of veterans' associations, service and ex-service personal and their families took part in the parade at the Cenotaph. Crowds, including Australia and New Zealand ex-pats, lined the streets to watch the ceremony which featured prayers read by schoolchildren and the national anthems of all three countries.

Fears were raised over a planned murder bid involving police being ambushed after reports of a non-existent crime. Hughes admitted two charges at Mold Crown Court on Friday. He will be sentenced next week. Hughes said he was planning to make a false report to the police so that officers would come to the scene, prosecutors said while outlining the case earlier in the proceedings. He said he would then shoot them on the Dee Estuary. The threats were made on two occasions, late at night, while Hughes was drunk. Judge Niclas Parry, who was told the defendant had a previous conviction for possessing a firearm in 2009, remanded him in custody pending sentence. During a previous hearing, Hughes's legal team said he had not intended to kill himself and would not have carried out any threat to kill police officers.

Ahead of the vote, he said providing new homes and improving existing social housing should be the authority's \"top priority\". He will officially replace Sir Albert Bore on 1 December. Mr Clancy, who has bid to become leader of the city council several times, was chosen in the ballot by the authority's 78 Labour councillors. Updates on this story and others on Birmingham and Black Country Sir Albert announced he would stand down as head of the self-styled \"largest local authority in Europe\". A close call for a man waiting in the wings for more than a decade. John Clancy has become leader of the Labour group after five attempts - and by just one vote. He will officially become leader of Birmingham City Council on 1st December when it's ratified at full council. An English teacher for many years, he's no stranger to working in the public sector but he also had a spell as a solicitor, as well as a business lecturer. His big message at a hustings last week was the council under his leadership can provide smarter financial decisions, political openness and free school meals for all primary age children. Some critics from within the party are already saying they're worried he won't have the clout or the vision to make the huge and rapid improvement needed to keep government commissioners at bay. The former Labour group leader's departure followed two other senior party figures, who resigned after criticising the way city was being run. Ian Ward, the deputy leader of the local authority and councillor Barry Henley also stood for the position. Mr Clancy, a former teacher and lecturer, has also pledged to widen access to free school meals for primary school children and expand regeneration outside the city centre. Birmingham City Council has found itself under scrutiny from a government-appointed independent panel. The panel was appointed at Sir Bob Kerslake's recommendation to oversee changes at the council. Sir Bob's study was commissioned after a series of reports focussed on the council during an inquiry into the so-called Trojan Horse letter.",

    "document": "Now the complete ban is being lifted.  Until now, any man who had ever had sex with another man was barred for life from donation. From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months. This deferral period has been left in place because there is a \"window period\" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable. This window period is far less than 12 months. The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test.  For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days. In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner. By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men. Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long. Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. \"To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence.\" But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: \"The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses.\" A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute. NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate. The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors. If you want more detail about the reasoning behind the decision to lift the ban, then the full report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) can be read here.",

The OU's Prof John Domingue told the BBC: \"This has been developed as a tool for tutors to help students. \"We are planning to use this data for students studying in 2015-16.\" The programme, called OU Analyse, was developed at the university during the 2013-14 academic year. It uses a variety of data sets held by the OU and assesses the likelihood of a student submitting their next assignment by using information gathered from four different algorithms. The more algorithms that indicate the student will not send in their work - the higher the chance of that happening. Prof Domingue added: \"We take advantage of the fact that modules are presented many times. One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students. An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts, like reading the material available and engaging with forums, is extremely valuable. \"Currently it is deployed on 13 modules, mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling. \"The model is tailored to each of the modules and by using this and identifying students, more tailored support may be provided.\" The OU has taken steps to ensure that students' privacy is not compromised by the scheme - putting in place an ethics policy, agreed in consultation with a student committee, to protect their data. Ruth Tudor, president of the Open University's Students' Association, thinks the scheme is a positive one. \"It's a great idea and a great way of providing targeted support to students who may be struggling and need extra help,\" she told the BBC. \"I would like to think that this would improve the drop-out rate from OU courses. You must remember they take students who have come from no academic background so it is always possible that those people take on more than they think they can manage. \"That's why data analytics will help provide extra support and can help them be successful.\" Reports suggest that some other British universities are thinking of using similar methods and Ms Tudor added: \"I don't see why this shouldn't happen in other universities. It has happened in the USA and I'm surprised they're not using it here.\"",

    "document": "A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system. It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet. \"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. \"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\". He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. \"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"",

Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. \"We welcome it, we are ready for it,\" he said. \"We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary.\" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. \"A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people\". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. \"We had an agreement with the crown prince,\" he said. \"The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue.\" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was \"hopeful\" that he would \"do more than his predecessor\", Hillary Clinton. \"US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more.\" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. \"If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. \"It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. \"So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy.\" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for \"peaceful demonstrations\", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. \"It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government.\" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. \"These people have a lot of followers in the street.  If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail.\"",

Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement. The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US. \"Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,\" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said. \"He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder.

As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved.

    "document": "Mr Abbott told Australian media that the only way to prevent people dying at sea was to \"stop the boats\". Australia detains any migrants trying to reach its shores by boat, and takes them to offshore processing camps to be eventually resettled elsewhere. On Thursday, the New York Times described the policy as \"brutal\". In an editorial, the newspaper said the \"ruthlessly effective\" policy was \"inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war\". It said it would be \"unconscionable\" for European leaders to consider adopting similar policies, as Mr Abbott has previously suggested. Australia has not responded to the editorial, but on Friday Mr Abbott said the image of Syrian three-year-old Alan Kurdi, who died trying to reach Greece by boat with his family, was \"very sad\". \"If you want to stop the deaths, if you want to stop the drownings you have got to stop the boats,\" he told ABC Radio. \"Thankfully, we have stopped that in Australia because we have stopped the illegal boats.\" On Thursday, Mr Abbott angered Australian Jewish groups by saying the so-called Islamic State (IS), from which many of the migrants to Europe are fleeing, was worse than the Nazis. \"The Nazis did terrible evil, but they had a sufficient sense of shame to try to hide it,\" he told Sydney Radio 2GB. But IS militants, he said, \"boast about their evil, this is the extraordinary thing\". The Executive Council of Australian Jewry Robert Goot said the comment was \"injudicious and unfortunate\", saying there was \"a fundamental difference between organised acts of terrorism and a genocide systematically implemented by a state as essential policy\". \"The crimes of Islamic State are indeed horrific but cannot be compared to the systematic round-up of millions of people and their despatch to purpose-built death camps for mass murder,\" he told Australian media. Mr Abbott later said he stood by his comments, but that he was not in the \"business of ranking evil\".",

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: \"The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. \"Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. \"Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" Mr Kirby said, admitting that \"this is not a decision that was taken lightly\". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: \"We regret this decision by Washington.\" \"Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. \"After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,\" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel \"that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre\".

    "document": "Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but \"driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be \"less of it\". \"The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. \"People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This is something that councils can choose to do already. \"Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. \"They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. \"If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.\" But Labour said the coalition's \"failed\" polices were \"making the housing crisis worse not better\". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: \"Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and \"put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. \"Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. \"That seems fairer to me,\" he added. The think tank also said the move would be \"extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be \"cleansed\" of \"hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices\". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced \"radical reforms\" to \"get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme \"set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes\". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure \"social housing goes to those in greatest need\", he added.",

    "document": "Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months. It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a \"similar location and mechanism\", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as \"fracking\", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: \"We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts. \"We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that.\" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: \"Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes. \"It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.\" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: \"The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde. \"Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site. \"Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles). \"The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.\"",

Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner. Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry's corner against the post late on. Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies. The Rs have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road, and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway's second game in charge.

But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. \"In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,\" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed \"at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',\" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov. Several Russian MPs have also gone to Crimea, including Russian celebrities - former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rodnina, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev.",

    "document": "It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver \"championships, plural\", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

Am I right? If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online: Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker. \"There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,\" he says. \"The chat room is like the foyer of a church.\" Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included: Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons. \"We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,\" says Mr Parker. \"The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.\" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. \"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says. \"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. \"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world.\" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. \"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. \"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious\". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. \"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal. \"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. \"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. \"I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,\" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. \"The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.\" \"Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,\" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. \"He was a great communicator.\" Sounds like a seal of approval to me.",

Novaya Gazeta says it amounts to a call for \"reprisals against journalists\". \"We urge the Russian authorities to do everything possible to prevent actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards journalists, who are doing their professional duty,\" the paper said. On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed. The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. \"All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya. Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them \"lies\". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that \"retribution\" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April. \"There will be retribution!\" he told the Russian news website RBC. \"Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.\" Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya. \"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue. Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova. But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya. The LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses. If Russia fails to prosecute anyone, it says it will file a case at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.",

    "document": "Investing Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men. The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\". Investing Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. \"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\".",

    "document": "The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: \"I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. \"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.\" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision. McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says he studied a \"litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \"several reasons to approve the fight\". Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. \"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. \"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer. \"Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself. \"That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\" McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: \"He's good to go.\" He also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said he oversaw an \"out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.",

    "document": "Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a \"very, very important place\" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, \"the Street of Shame\" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. \"I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. \"I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'.\" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. \"There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying.\" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. \"The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time.\" His memories of the street in its heyday are of \"watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers\". \"Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago.\" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of \"certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then\". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. \"At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,\" he says. \"The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards.\" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there. \"Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street. \"But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street. \"When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one. \"Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm. \"The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. \"At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool. \"I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him. \"He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'\" But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the \"Stab in the Back\" is a Pizza Express. Now a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline. \"As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,\" says Mr Smith. \"It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history.\"",

    "document": "It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: \"Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. \"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. \"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\" A Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. \"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"",

The married mother-of-three, a lollipop lady for 20 years, had been on duty in Bedford Road as pupils left school. When the traffic lights turned red, Mrs Blackburn, who was wearing appropriate clothing, stepped out to escort a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road. Prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod said traffic in the other direction had stopped, but the defendant did not, and hit her.

    "document": "It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters. It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences. For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves. U33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships. Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training \"focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare\". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: \"I wouldn't want to comment on that,\" before adding: \"In general, we're always on the lookout.\" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the \"quietest submarine in the world\". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world\". When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and \"fingerprinting\" other nations' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named \"Dynamic Mongoose\", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters. RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a \"key vulnerability\". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, he says, should be \"exceptionally worried\" that it is seen as a \"soft touch\", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare. But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",

    "document": "United Nations officials rarely use the words \"genocide\" and \"ethnic cleansing,\" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. \"They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,\" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. \"They don't want us,\" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. \"These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them.\" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.\"We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,\" he said. \"It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.\" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. \"This has been unrelenting since July,\" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. \"The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides.\" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. \"War, war, war,\" she began, \"who are you and where do you come from?\" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. \"You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan.\" There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people.

    "document": "Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. \"I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,\" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. \"DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. \"We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the \"genocide\" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is \"We won't forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.\" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

And she was again visibly emotional after Mr Salmond told the chamber: \"It's goodbye from me... for now\". Ms Marwick, Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May. Mr Salmond, who served as first minister between 2007 and 2014, used his valedictory address to repeat a belief he expressed in his very first speech in the parliament that Scotland was \"not divided, but diverse\". He said both the country and parliament were on a journey, and added: \"Yes we are a country of different views, but we are not divided. There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland. \"And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that\". He welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign. There were lighters moments as Mr Salmond, who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget, joked that he was aware that he faced competition from a \"major attraction down south today\". He then added: \"However, on balance, I feel that the champion chase at Cheltenham racecourse will not be overshadowed by my remarks.\" And the former SNP leader joked that he wished everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck, \"albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm\". He concluded his address by saying: \"Let me leave you with these final thoughts - there is no greater honour in public life than to be a member of this parliament. \"There is no greater task than to mould the public purpose of Scotland. There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country. \"And so with that it is goodbye from me... for now\". Ms Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that he had \"served the parliament and Scotland with distinction\". The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it was established in 1999. Mr McNeil used his address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system. He said: \"It will be this parliament's responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary. \"We must ensure we are capable of meeting that challenge, or we will face the consequences.\" He recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster. But Mr McNeil said: \"It saddens me to say we now have to do a bit of learning from them and how they run their business.\" Former Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood. In her speech, she joked she would miss her dealings with Finance Secretary John Swinney, especially \"his huge outbursts of faux indignation\".",

The chair of Care Forum Wales, Mario Kreft, said his group was dedicated to developing and promoting best practice in social care and it supported the overall aims of the review. \"Our disappointment however - which will be shared by many providers - is that the commissioner has not included a provider expert on the main advisory panel,\" he said. \"As far as we can see no-one who has lived in, worked in, managed or owned a care home is represented on the panel. \"In our view, this misses the opportunity for partnership working and to engage the sector fully into the advisory panel.\"",

It advertised for a personal assistant with \"a classic look, brown long hair with b-c cup\". The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) called it \"appalling, unlawful and demeaning to women\". Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the EHRC, said it would be writing to Matching Models \"asking for them to clarify their hiring practices immediately\". Meanwhile, women's equality campaigners said its ads were \"straight out of the 1970s\". Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: \"It is extraordinary that they are taking this approach and almost certainly falls foul of equality legislation. \"If we ever wonder why the battle for gender equality hasn't been won, this is a timely reminder.\" The agency's founder Nathalie Jansen said: \"Our clients are important to us - and looks are important.\" Another job advert on the agency's website asks a \"sexy female driver\" to drive a Porsche Cayenne two days a week for between £40,000 and £50,000-a-year for a Knightsbridge-based businessman and polo team owner. Employment lawyer James Lynas, partner at Winckworth Sherwood, said the advert was \"clearly unlawful\", adding anyone could complain to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who have powers to intervene. He said an employment tribunal could find the use of phrases such as \"beautiful and attractive\" were really code for \"young\", and in reality discriminatory against older women. He added: \"A male driver who genuinely wanted the job could submit an application and sue for sex discrimination if rejected. Compensation for such claims is unlimited. \" A statement on the agency's website states: \"It is almost politically incorrect to request someone to work for you that is both attractive as well as professionally equipped with the right set of skills. \"However, our company understands the importance of having the right people representing your company, because after all, first impressions count.\" But Ms Hilsenrath said: \"Matching Models are right about one thing; first impressions count, but the important stuff is not about your hair colour. \"If they wish to maintain their reputation, they should act like a business in the 21st Century and consign this type of sexism to the history books.\" Under the 2010 Equality Act, it is against the law to say, or imply, that you will discriminate against anyone - including saying that you are unable to cater for disabled workers. Employers are also not allowed to question a candidate's age, sexual orientation, marital status, number of children or plans to have children, disability, race or religion. As for specifying clothing sizes, an employer has to be able to show that it is essential to the nature or context of the work. Talking about the personal assistant advert, Ms Jansen said: \"The client who wants the specific cup size is an older gentleman - he has a specific outfit he designed with Christian Dior. He wants a \"Jackie O\" look. And he wants a lady with a smaller cup size to fit into the outfit.\" \"I recently had an Indian businessman who interviewed 60 women from my firm. He wanted a blonde, blue eyed, Greek woman. He hired 6 of them to work on his plane.\" Matching Models clients include MTV, Louis Vuitton, Coca-Cola, the Renualt Formula 1 team and Harrods. Ms Jansen said she had hired 5,000 people worldwide and pointed out MTV wanted models with tattoos and piercings.",

    "document": "A journalist and stock market officials are among those arrested, Xinhua said. It gave no other details. Chinese shares fell by nearly 8% after a week of volatile trading that spread fear to global markets. The Tianjin explosions killed 150 people - with 23 still missing. A total of 367 people remain in hospital after the 12 August blast at a warehouse where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored. Twenty are in critical condition, according to Xinhua. Separately, the UK's Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mishandled their stock market rescue efforts. The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of \"destabilising the market\". Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours. The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said. The news agency said \"seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II\" were also among the offences. A journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials, according to a Xinhua report. The journalist, Wang Xiaolu, is accused of \"spreading fake information\" about the market slump, the report said. The state news agency said Mr Wang confessed that he \"wrote fake report on Chinese stock market based on hearsay and his own subjective guesses without conducting due verifications\". In 2013 Chinese authorities introduced a possible three-year sentence for spreading rumours - the sentence was supposed to apply to anyone who posted a rumour that was reposted 500 times or viewed 5,000 times. Last year, Qin Zhihui, a blogger, was sentenced to three years in a government crackdown on internet rumours. Mr Qin was found guilty of \"slander\" and \"picking quarrels and provoking troubles\", state broadcaster CCTV said at the time.",

The left side of my lower back took the brunt of it and my left elbow is bruised as well.\" Johnson's caddie was placing the ball on his tee for him on the range, while coach Butch Harmon said pain hindered Johnson's rest overnight. Shortly before his withdrawal, he progressed from hitting wedge shots on the range to fuller swings and his involvement looked likely as he made his way to the first tee for a scheduled 19:03 BST start alongside playing partners Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker. Johnson was a popular pick to win the first major of the year as a result of the fine form he has shown in 2017. He has won the past three tournaments in which he has competed - February's Genesis Open, and both the WGC Mexico Championship and WGC Dell Match Play in March. As well as winning last year's US Open by four shots, he finished ninth at the Open Championship and tied fourth at the Masters. BBC Radio 5 live correspondent Iain Carter Johnson took until the very last second to make what must have been an agonising decision to pull out. He was standing on the first tee before making the toughest call of his career. It is a severe blow for the player who has dominated golf this season.

The Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) said on Tuesday it had approved the screening but with \"a minor edit concerning a gay moment in the film\". Homosexual activity is illegal in Muslim majority Malaysia, although the country's tourism minister has said banning the film is \"ridiculous\". A new release date has yet to be announced.   The live-action remake was granted a \"P13 parental guidance classification\". \"We have approved the film so there is no more issue. Once a film receives approval, it means it can be screened,\" LPF Chairman Datuk Abdul Hamid said. \"However, the date of screening and where the screening takes place is not under LPF's jurisdiction. We only look at the content and give a decision on whether the movie gets approved or not.\" Local cinema chains have been offering refunds for customers who have purchased tickets in advance. Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon has spoken about the \"exclusively gay moment\" in the film. It involves LeFou - the sidekick of the film's main antagonist Gaston - who tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story. The decision to review the Disney classic in Malaysia courted criticism from netizens, many of whom called it \"stupid and laughable\". \"Malaysia bans 'Beauty and the Beast' but is okay with nonsense Malay movies with no moral values, just full of brainless jokes,\" wrote a Twitter user in a tweet which drew more than 4,500 re-tweets.

It is a key element of a package of reforms promised by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. The law seeks to end Italy's post-war era of revolving governments, political horse-trading and unstable coalitions. The lower house of parliament gave final approval to the bill by 334 votes to 61. The proportional election system awards 340 out of 630 seats to any party that wins more than 40% of the national vote. If no party reaches that threshold, there is a second-round run-off between the two parties with the most votes. The electoral reform is expected to come into force next year. After the vote, Mr Renzi said: \"Commitment achieved, promise respected. Italy needs people who don't always say no.\" Critics have accused the 40-year-old former mayor of Florence who became prime minster last year of trying to consolidate his grip on power. They complain that the law awards too much power to single parties, gives party bosses too much scope to select candidates, and denies voters the chance to directly choose representatives. Opposition parties boycotted Monday's vote. Renato Brunetta, parliamentary head of centre-right opposition party Forza Italia, said afterwards that it was \"a very ugly day for our country's democracy\". Mr Renzi wants to further transform the Italian system by abolishing the Senate and replacing it with a non-elected body with lesser powers.

But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month. Adminstrators Begbies Traynor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire. The Art Fund, which led the campaign, will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum. Administrator Bob Young said it had been \"incredibly satisfying\" to sign off on the sale on Monday. \"Today's fantastic outcome wouldn't have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations,\" he said. The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc's pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009.

Alison Wedgwood, whose husband Tom is a direct descendant of company founder Josiah Wedgwood, said the collection was \"important\" for Staffordshire. The collection risked being \"sold and scattered around the globe\" had the money not been raised, she added.

He called for more international financial support to help build schools and train teachers. \"The alternatives are very bad,\" said Mr Thneibat. \"The international community will pay a high price if we don't stand together to face this serious problem,\" he told the Global Education and Skills Forum. Mr Thneibat said Jordan already had Palestinian and Iraqi refugees and now had 1.3 million Syrians who had fled across its borders. \"We're trying to do everything to educate these young people for peace, introducing ideas of tolerance and co-existence,\" Mr Thneibat, who is also Jordan's education minister, told the international conference in Dubai. But he warned that Syria's neighbours did not have the capacity to deal with such an influx of families without more international assistance. He said Jordan was training thousands more teachers and building new schools, which would operate in double shifts to try to accommodate 145,000 refugee children in its state school system. But there were still more children arriving than could be taught, he warned. There had been financial support from the international community - and more had been pledged, Mr Thneibat said - but almost two-thirds of the cost of each extra refugee pupil was being taken from Jordan's own education budget, he said. This was in addition to extra costs in health, housing and infrastructure. Without any access to education, he said such youngsters could become part of another cycle of conflict. \"If we leave these students, we believe they could become extremists.\" Tom Fletcher, UK ambassador to Lebanon until last year, said the numbers of refugees were now \"staggering\". Mr Fletcher is now working for a coalition trying to get business support to tackle the refugee crisis. He said conventional humanitarian crisis approaches did not work on this scale, and that other groups, including business, should contribute. George Papendreou, former prime minister of Greece, told the conference that he had been a refugee when his family was in political exile. He said that European countries should try to see refugees as potential benefits to their societies rather than respond with \"fear and ignorance\".",

McIlroy, 27, has never finished worse than 11th in his seven appearances at Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai. Westwood, meanwhile, carded seven birdies and just one bogey in his 66. The 43-year-old Englishman found out earlier this week he would not be competing in the World Cup in Melbourne next week. Westwood's partner Danny Willett pulled out because of a back problem, and his place went to Chris Wood. Under tournament rules, Wood was able to select his own partner and opted for Andy Sullivan. \"I'm disappointed not to be playing,\" said Westwood. \"I can understand him picking a mate and he has picked a very good player. It is probably more to do with the rules than anything.\" The Tour Championship is the final event of the Race to Dubai, with four players still in with a chance of topping the European Tour Order of Merit. Henrik Stenson, holder of a course-record 25 under at the Earth Course, leads but Willett can leapfrog the Swede should he win the tournament. Willett would also top the list if he finishes second and neither Stenson nor Alex Noren win in Dubai. Noren, another Swede, needs to finish at least second and hope Stenson and Willett finish down the field. McIlroy has an outside chance which requires several permutations falling into place - including Stenson finishing no higher than 46th in the 60-man field. It took McIlroy 14 holes to register his first birdie of the day, and although he swiftly added another on the next, the four-time major winner double-bogeyed the 16th after needing two attempts - the second minus his right shoe and sock - to play from the edge of a water hazard.

East Sussex's fire authority said it would co-operate with the PCC but it believed collaboration could be achieved without elaborate structural change. Ms Bourne said she had written to WSCC leader Louise Goldsmith and Phil Howson, East Sussex Fire Authority chairman, to request they begin to look at the feasibility of bringing both fire services under her authority. \"Just as we have one police force that effectively manages the county, we need to understand if one fire service not two could achieve the same,\" she said.

Ms Goldsmith said West Sussex fire service was already integrated within the council and served communities. She added last year's Shoreham air disaster showed how West Sussex emergency services already worked together.

    "document": "The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was \"promising\", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: \"The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.\"",

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,\" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.

He said he had already won backing from Poland that it would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights. The EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as a higher education law. Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros. Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months. Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would backtrack on any of the three issues, Mr Szijjarto answered: \"No. Why should we? \"These laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues.\" The minister added that \"my Polish colleague\" had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary. EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously. Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports. Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers, raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law. Hungary's Higher Education Law, signed in April, could force the closure of the Budapest-based CEU, which ranks among the top 200 universities in the world in eight disciplines.

    "document": "They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy \"sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment\". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as \"sexier\" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. \"There's a huge market for our timber. Every saw miller tells me he would double or treble production if the timber was there to feed that mill,\" he added.",

I walked past it and then it got me on the way back and as soon as it grabbed me it took off into the water.\" He manage to drive himself back to the club house to get help.

Bidders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships. The BBC understands no proposals to preserve the ships have been submitted. Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March. A final decision is not expected until the spring. The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field. Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said it was important UK recyclers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrapyard. She added: \"For anyone that has served on a ship it's your home, you've literally been through the wars with it... and you want them to have a noble second life. \"My preference is to go for the reef and diving attraction. \"We've got to get best value for the budget but a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism.\" The Ministry of Defence has previously said it will \"consider all options\" for the frigates to ensure \"best financial return for the taxpayer\". A spokeswoman would not comment on the number or nature of the bids received due to \"commercial sensitivity\". Originally designed as a specialist anti-submarine ship, the Type 22 frigate evolved into a powerful surface combatant with substantial anti-surface, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons systems.

German authorities have asked the US ambassador for \"swift clarification\". The US National Security Agency (NSA) was last year accused of bugging the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel as part of a huge surveillance programme. The scale of the agency's global spy programme was revealed in documents leaked last year by a former intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden. The revelations about the NSA put a strain on ties between Germany and the US and raised feeling in Germany against American surveillance. The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin says the new allegation of American spying on an ally may make it harder for the US to get German help in its efforts to oppose Russian activity in Ukraine, and also to control Iranian nuclear ambitions. German media say the man arrested this week is a 31-year-old employee of the federal service, the BND or Bundesnachrichtendienst. The German federal prosecutor's office confirmed the man's arrest, but gave no other details. A spokesman for Ms Merkel said she had been informed of the arrest, as had the members of the nine-strong parliamentary committee investigating the activities of foreign intelligence agencies in Germany. \"The matter is serious, it is clear,\" spokesman Steffen Seibert told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, Der Spiegel news magazine said the man was believed to have passed secret documents to a US contact in exchange for money. However, one unnamed politician told Reuters news agency the suspect had offered his services to the US voluntarily. \"This was a man who had no direct contact with the investigative committee... He was not a top agent,\"   the source said. Germany is particularly sensitive to reports of espionage on its territory because many of its citizens from the formerly communist east of the country were spied upon by the Stasi secret police.",

Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas. Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular. Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches. (% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable) England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else. Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: \"Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate. \"School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet.\" Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: \"Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged. \"From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat. \"School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety.\" School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines. About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools. More children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46%.

Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said:  \"The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. \"We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable.\" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining \"high quality care for local people\" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: \"People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance. \"We have launched this investigation to find out more about the financial situation at the trust and to establish what can be done to improve things.\"",

Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: \"Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. \"Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. \"The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. \"But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs.\" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: \"We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough. \"The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target.

However, doctors instead discovered and removed a large primary cancer and five smaller growths. The news shocked Josh's family, but since his diagnosis they have received lots of support from people all over the world. It began as a hashtag on Facebook and Instagram by Bangor Elim Church, where Josh's father is on the pastoral staff, and has since gone viral. The church's senior pastor, Gary Beattie, said he was amazed by how many people have supported Josh and his family so far. \"We were in total shock when he was diagnosed, and really the family just wanted support from people and to ask people to pray for Josh,\" Gary said. \"It certainly isn't a campaign as such, we just put the hashtag on our Facebook posts to get some of our congregation thinking about him. We had no idea that it would take off. \"We would use social media quite a lot because we have quite a young congregation, and we've been posting updates about Josh from his family. \"The update was shared 948 times and it's been seen by over 79,000 people. It's absolutely phenomenal. \"We thought there had been a mistake, but you can look at the views and where they've come from, and there are people all over the world supporting him, which is great.\" But how did a social media hashtag lead to the appearance of the massive billboard? Gary said that last week a mystery donor paid for the sign and it was erected at Holywood playing fields. \"We do not know where it came from, we didn't put it there, but it means a lot to have such support,\" Gary said. There has also been a huge outpouring of support on Twitter for the Bangor Grammar pupil, with his classmates using the now-global hashtag for their friend. As Josh's family and friends continue to support him in his recovery, it now seems there will be people all over the world will be following suit, thanks to the kindness of County Down strangers.",

Following her surprise return to Albert Square, Dame Barbara announced her character would be killed off. Her character reappeared on Friday, having left in 2010, to tell her eldest son Phil, played by Steve McFadden, that her cancer had returned. After the episode, producers revealed that Peggy would die from the disease in emotional scenes to be screened in the spring. Now Kemp, who played Grant from 1990-1999 and then again in 2005 and 2006, will return to bring the Mitchell family back together. \"Barbara is a very close friend, so when I learned of the storyline it felt right that the Mitchell brothers are reunited with their mother for the last time,\" he said. \"I am really looking forward to going back to EastEnders and filming what are set to be some classic EastEnders episodes.\" Grant Mitchell has been one of the soap's most memorable characters in its 30-year history, arriving in 1990 along with brother Phil. He was involved in repeated family dramas including having an affair with his brother's wife, Kathy, and having his brother go on to marry his ex-wife Sharon. \"Grant Mitchell is an EastEnders legend and finally he is returning home to Walford to say goodbye to his mother and be reunited not just with his old loves but also his brother,\" said EastEnders executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins. \"To have the Mitchell brothers come face to face again, having to face losing their mother, is an opportunity to show Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden at their very best.\"",

In the 1990s, he was a star player at the University of Nebraska, making him a sought-after rookie in the NFL. Phillips played for the St Louis Rams, Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers until 1999, but he was plagued by trouble on and off the field. After his NFL career, Phillips continued to have problems with the law. Eventually, he was sent to prison after being convicted of assault for driving his car into a group of teenagers. In another case, he was convicted of assaulting a former girlfriend. Phillips, who was serving a term of more than 30 years, had been placed in a cell alone after he was accused of killing his former cellmate. On Tuesday, a judge found that there was enough evidence to try Phillips in the death of Damion Soward, 37.

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.",

Concerns over the future of some of the 5,000 workers at the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency centre were raised in October after Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement. The chancellor announced that the tax disc would be replaced with an electronic system in October 2014. The new system will allow people to pay the charge by monthly direct debit. Mr Hedges had written to Mr Hammond asking for clarification of the government's intentions. In his response to Mr Hedges, Mr Hammond said: \"It is likely that the introduction of a direct debit scheme may mean there will be a natural reduction in the amount of refunds received, in addition to the withdrawal of the tax disc. \"This may mean changes to job roles and the need to train on new processes. \"Any reductions in numbers of people needed for these activities will be managed through redeploying to other growth areas of the business.\" Mr Hedges welcomed the minister's assurances. He added: \"Whilst disappointed that the changes will reduce the number of job opportunities at the DVLA, I can see the advantages of both paying by monthly direct debits and not having to show a tax disc. \"I am pleased the minister is committed to redeployment rather than redundancies and I am sure this response will give comfort to many concerned DVLA employees.\"",

Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One. A service was also held at Westminster Abbey. The national anthems of New Zealand and Australia were sung as the service ended. The first time Anzac Day was commemorated in the capital was when King George V attended a Westminster Abbey service in 1916, a year after the Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) landings at Gallipoli. Since then, the services have become an important moment for thousands of expatriate and visiting New Zealanders and Australians, who honour the sacrifices of their countrymen and women in all wars. Addressing the crowds at the dawn service, Alexander Downer, Australian high commissioner to the UK, who also laid a wreath, said: \"When we reflect on Anzac Day we imagine the Gallipoli landings, what it must have been like, at dawn on the water, in sight of that rugged shoreline - and a collectively held breath, a leaden silence about to be broken. \"We consider the enthusiasm, the courage, and the heroism of the Anzac troops - ordinary men fighting for God, King and empire, for their mates, for adventure, for a world without war.\" Members of veterans' associations, service and ex-service personal and their families took part in the parade at the Cenotaph. Crowds, including Australia and New Zealand ex-pats, lined the streets to watch the ceremony which featured prayers read by schoolchildren and the national anthems of all three countries. The eight-month campaign on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey was one of the bloodiest of the war and the allied operation was an attempt to force the Ottoman empire out of the war.",

Fears were raised over a planned murder bid involving police being ambushed after reports of a non-existent crime. Hughes admitted two charges at Mold Crown Court on Friday. He will be sentenced next week. Hughes said he was planning to make a false report to the police so that officers would come to the scene, prosecutors said while outlining the case earlier in the proceedings. He said he would then shoot them on the Dee Estuary. The threats were made on two occasions, late at night, while Hughes was drunk. Judge Niclas Parry, who was told the defendant had a previous conviction for possessing a firearm in 2009, remanded him in custody pending sentence. During a previous hearing, Hughes's legal team said he had not intended to kill himself and would not have carried out any threat to kill police officers. The court heard at the time, North Wales Police was particularly concerned because the defendant was on bail, awaiting trial for firearms offences, of which he was subsequently cleared.

Ahead of the vote, he said providing new homes and improving existing social housing should be the authority's \"top priority\". He will officially replace Sir Albert Bore on 1 December. Mr Clancy, who has bid to become leader of the city council several times, was chosen in the ballot by the authority's 78 Labour councillors. Updates on this story and others on Birmingham and Black Country Sir Albert announced he would stand down as head of the self-styled \"largest local authority in Europe\". A close call for a man waiting in the wings for more than a decade. John Clancy has become leader of the Labour group after five attempts - and by just one vote. He will officially become leader of Birmingham City Council on 1st December when it's ratified at full council. An English teacher for many years, he's no stranger to working in the public sector but he also had a spell as a solicitor, as well as a business lecturer. His big message at a hustings last week was the council under his leadership can provide smarter financial decisions, political openness and free school meals for all primary age children. Some critics from within the party are already saying they're worried he won't have the clout or the vision to make the huge and rapid improvement needed to keep government commissioners at bay. The former Labour group leader's departure followed two other senior party figures, who resigned after criticising the way city was being run. Ian Ward, the deputy leader of the local authority and councillor Barry Henley also stood for the position. Mr Clancy, a former teacher and lecturer, has also pledged to widen access to free school meals for primary school children and expand regeneration outside the city centre. Birmingham City Council has found itself under scrutiny from a government-appointed independent panel. The panel was appointed at Sir Bob Kerslake's recommendation to oversee changes at the council. Sir Bob's study was commissioned after a series of reports focussed on the council during an inquiry into the so-called Trojan Horse letter.",

    "document": "Now the complete ban is being lifted.  Until now, any man who had ever had sex with another man was barred for life from donation. From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months. This deferral period has been left in place because there is a \"window period\" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable. This window period is far less than 12 months. The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test.  For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days. In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner. By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men. Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long. Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. \"To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence.\" But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: \"The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses.\" A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute. NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate. The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors. If you want more detail about the reasoning behind the decision to lift the ban, then the full report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) can be read here.",

The OU's Prof John Domingue told the BBC: \"This has been developed as a tool for tutors to help students. \"We are planning to use this data for students studying in 2015-16.\" The programme, called OU Analyse, was developed at the university during the 2013-14 academic year. It uses a variety of data sets held by the OU and assesses the likelihood of a student submitting their next assignment by using information gathered from four different algorithms. The more algorithms that indicate the student will not send in their work - the higher the chance of that happening. Prof Domingue added: \"We take advantage of the fact that modules are presented many times. One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students. An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts, like reading the material available and engaging with forums, is extremely valuable. \"Currently it is deployed on 13 modules, mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling. \"The model is tailored to each of the modules and by using this and identifying students, more tailored support may be provided.\" The OU has taken steps to ensure that students' privacy is not compromised by the scheme - putting in place an ethics policy, agreed in consultation with a student committee, to protect their data. Ruth Tudor, president of the Open University's Students' Association, thinks the scheme is a positive one. \"It's a great idea and a great way of providing targeted support to students who may be struggling and need extra help,\" she told the BBC. \"I would like to think that this would improve the drop-out rate from OU courses. You must remember they take students who have come from no academic background so it is always possible that those people take on more than they think they can manage. \"That's why data analytics will help provide extra support and can help them be successful.\" Reports suggest that some other British universities are thinking of using similar methods and Ms Tudor added: \"I don't see why this shouldn't happen in other universities.

    "document": "A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system. It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet. \"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. \"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\". He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. \"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"",

    "document": "Ch Insp David Pettigrew believes the cameras would act as a deterrent to disorder and vandalism. Glasgow City Council said the implementation of cameras had been explored but the topography of the site made it difficult. The Glasgow Necropolis is a historic cemetery and tourist attraction. The 37-acre Victorian cemetery, east of the city centre, contains about 3,500 monuments and sculptures. Ch Insp Pettigrew, the officer in charge of the Necropolis area, told the BBC: \"At this time of year, it is not the same as the spring and summer months. This is an area where people come to drink. They do that because it is out the way. \"That brings with it anti-social behaviours and disorder, whether deliberate or otherwise. It damages the headstones as well, so there is a clearly a disrespectful aspect to that. The headstones have been here for hundreds of years and can be loose, and if they fall over they can cause serious injury. \"Primarily, we are talking about drinking in the Necropolis. Gang activity in the east end in general is very much in the decline in recent years.\" Ch Insp Pettigrew said police officers take part in regular patrols of the necropolis during the spring and summer months, supported by teams from Community Safety Glasgow, who work in close consultation with the city council. The senior officer said the teams from Community Safety sometimes patrol the area with mobile CCTV vans but he would like to see this taken a step further. He added: \"CCTV has proven to be an effective aide to policing in many other parts of the city, so I think it would go without saying that it would be a benefit to this area also. \"The cameras themselves act as a deterrent because when people know they are here, they clearly don't have the same advantage as being able to hide behind a bush or a tree, but in the event that something happens it gives us the opportunity to find the people responsible. Quite clearly, we cannot be here 24 hours a day.\" Police Scotland told the BBC they only received six reports of crime at the necropolis between April and August 2015 - four of vandalism, one breach of the peace and once incidence of drinking in a public place. Three people were reported to the procurator fiscal over these incidents. The Friends of Glasgow Necropolis are a group of volunteers who conduct tours of the cemetery, and raise money for conservation and restoration work at the Necropolis. Ruth Johnston, the group's chairwoman, said: \"I don't think it (anti-social behaviour at the Necropolis) is any different from a large park in a very large city. We bring a lot of tourists here. \"People feel very safe coming in here, and there wouldn't be so many people coming if they didn't feel safe. \"The Glasgow Necropolis is incredibly inspiring, no matter what your interests are - history, social history, archaeology, architecture, sculpture. Some of the most famous sculptors have done work here.\" Alexander \"Greek\" Thomson and Charles Rennie Mackintosh are among those whose work is at the Necropolis, while William Miller - the man who wrote the Wee Willie Winkie nursery rhyme - is also buried there. A memorial for Glasgow firefighters is one of 3,500 in the cemetery, with an estimated 50,000 people buried at the site in total. Next year, the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis hopes to raise Â£60,000 for the restoration of the Monteith mausoleum, and they will continue commemorations for those who died in World War One and other conflicts. A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: \"Community Safety Glasgow currently deploy two daily security patrols, staggered day and night, to the Necropolis and random mobile CCTV patrols are also conducted in the area to deter and detect antisocial behaviour. Foot patrols are also carried out within the Necropolis to deter dog fouling. \"There are also quarterly meetings between Police Scotland, the council, Community Safety Glasgow and the Friends of the Necropolis group to discuss any issues. \"The possibility of using re-deployable CCTV in the Necropolis was also explored, but the topography of the site made it difficult in terms of radio signalling.\" A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotland, which is a statutory consultee for the Glasgow Necropolis, added: \"We are aware that there has been an issue with vandalism and anti-social behaviour at Glasgow Necropolis. \"Whilst we are not aware of any recent requests to Glasgow City Council planning department regarding the potential installation of CCTV we would be happy to discuss this and other proposals for improving security within the grounds of the Necropolis with them. \"Public security measures such as CCTV are not uncommon practice within other historic sites and buildings and we would work with the applicant to discuss possible options.\"",

The tourist, a certified diver, was helped to the surface but could not be revived. It comes after two French tourists died while snorkelling on the reef at Michaelmas Cay on Wednesday. They are both believed to have suffered cardiac arrests. Paramedics were alerted to the latest tragedy just after 12.30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Friday. \"CPR was performed on a male patient in his sixties by a nurse on board a vessel and subsequently by a doctor,\" a Queensland Ambulance spokeswoman said.

    "document": "The crackdown combats phishing by ensuring that the websites of legitimate banks appear at the top of search results. The move comes as the personal details of more than 45 million Chinese people were stolen in separate attacks. The government is investigating the thefts and said that the wave of attacks \"threatened internet safety\". The 10 biggest search engines in China have signed up to the anti-phishing scheme to ensure that users looking for bank websites go to the right place. Phishing attacks involve messages that look like they come from a bank or other organisation and direct people to a website that mimics the real thing. When people visit the fake site and enter their login details these are recorded by cyber criminals who may loot the account soon afterwards. By ensuring that the websites of banks appear first, the government hopes to limit the numbers of people falling for phishing scams and visiting the fake sites. Some of the search engines will put a special icon next to the bank links in lists of results to flag them as legitimate. The anti-phishing initiative comes at the end of a week in which the personal details of almost 10% of China's 485 million web users were stolen. On Christmas day, the hugely popular Tianya chat site revealed that the login names and passwords from 40 million of its users had been stolen. All risk being plundered by attackers as the information was held in plain text. Tianya has contacted the affected users and urged them to change their passwords as soon as possible. Soon after, CDSN, one of China's largest forums for programmers, reported that the details of all its six million users had been stolen. The attackers got away with email addresses, login names and passwords. Again, all the details were stored in plain text. The scale of the attacks prompted government action and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it would investigate who was behind the attacks. \"The department believes the recent leak of user information is a serious infringement of the rights of internet users and threatens internet safety,\" the Ministry said in a statement. The Chinese government is known to have put in place technology that monitors online chat rooms for controversial topics but the far-reaching measures have not stopped all nefarious cyber activity. As well as criminal hackers, many activists are turning to the web to make protests more visible. The website of Mengniu, a firm at the centre of a tainted milk scandal, was vandalised and its homepage image replaced with text that read \"Do you have a conscience?\".",

Sunni rebels led by militant group Isis have occupied large swathes of northern and western Iraq. They have declared a large region straddling Iraq and Syria a caliphate or Islamic state. About 10,000 Indians are reported to be working in Iraq. Scores of them have returned to India since fighting began. \"We are very happy [to be freed],\" Marina Jose, one of the nurses released by the militants told NDTV. \"We never thought we would come out because the situation was very bad.\" She said that the militants had for the most part treated them well. At the airport: Imran Qureshi, BBC News, Kochi. The nurses received a tumultuous welcome, led by their families and the chief minister of the southern state of Kerala, Oomen Chandy. Every political party was represented. The nurses gave differing accounts of how they had been treated. One nurse, Shermin Varghese, told the BBC the militants in Tikrit had said they were being taken to an airport. Another, Marina Jose, said they had been told only that they were heading to Mosul. They said they had burst into tears when the militants showed them their bombs and ammunition on the bus. But both of them said they had not been mistreated. The exact circumstances of their release are unclear - they are reported to have been pressured into boarding buses and leaving the hospital by jihadist fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis). They were reportedly then taken to Mosul before being freed. The specially-chartered flight was also carrying about 100 other Indians leaving Iraq. Tikrit is among a number of towns and cities seized by jihadist-led Sunni rebels in recent weeks.

    "document": "However, there were people in the TV industry who thought the cast would struggle to find work once their time on the show was up. Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn't be able to shake off their sulky, angry, teen characters. But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O'Connell for example, they couldn't have been more wrong. Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest-serving members of the cast, appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem. She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp. Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience. He'd starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002. He has since gone on to play Beast in the X-Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals. Dev Patel's first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two, took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire. He told Newsbeat, he never would have got that role without Skins. \"My career started off because Danny Boyle's daughter was a fan of the show, that is how I got an audition for Slumdog.\" He has two films out in cinemas at the moment, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Jack O'Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand-picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken. The 24-year-old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year's Baftas. Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively. It is, of course, not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films. What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel. So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors? Co-creator Bryan Elsley told Newsbeat they made a conscious decision to hold open auditions. \"There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion we decided to go a different way,\" he explained. \"We felt if we had young people playing characters the same age as themselves, and those actors weren't too trained, it would have a more natural feel.\" It sounds quite risky, but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with, they were able to take that approach. Jack O'Connell credits the whole team for the actors' future success. \"I think they knew if they were going to identify that genre, that era, that generation, they needed people on the ground level,\" he said. \"A writing team that understood, they got that right first and then I guess they chose to cast exciting people. \"I feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but I don't think it was a coincidence that we all came through there.\" Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and he thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch themselves that helped nurture their talent. \"They had the opportunity to do properly complex [roles], rather than just two dimensional ones,\" he said. \"It is extraordinary, in the past soap operas had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do their first job. \"That would have been your only break, but time's are changing. \"I think thanks to shows like Skins, unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common.\" Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube.",

Donald Findlater, of child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, said the changing online environment and social networking in recent years had introduced \"massive challenges and risks\".

A spokeswoman for child abuse charity NSPCC Cymru said: \"Schools need to be rigorous in their recruitment and checking processes and provide regular training about appropriate behaviour, making it absolutely clear that crossing the line will never be tolerated.\" During the same period, other teachers were disciplined after being convicted of driving, alcohol, drugs, harassment and fraud offences. Others were punished for assaulting pupils, helping children cheat during tests, failing to achieve required standards, not following health and safety procedures, and failing to investigate bullying.",

    "document": "Healthwatch England put in a Freedom of Information request and found psychiatric patients now spend six fewer days in hospital than in 2012-13. The data, from 32 mental health trusts, shows average number of \"bed days\" per patient per year has fallen by 10%. Healthwatch England says some patients are being discharged too early and without enough support. Anna Bradley, chairwoman of Healthwatch England, said the findings reflect a troubling picture where patients discharged from hospital often struggle to access crisis treatment at home. \"What is particularly problematic is when people leave institutions, they cannot access the support they need in the community. We have heard of cases where people have taken their own lives. Our concern is that people are being lost between hospitals and community services.\" Latest statistics show that in recent years, the number of suicides of patients being cared for at home has been double that of inpatients. Prof Louis Appleby, chairman of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy advisory group, says the numbers represent a change in the nature of acute psychiatric care, with treatment increasingly being provided outside hospitals. While many patients prefer care at home, it can also represent a risk. \"The ideological drive towards services in the community and away from beds, can go too far. Eventually that drive crosses a line - and that line is safety. If you combine the ideological drive with pressure on resources, you have a toxic combination,\" he said. Graeme Price died after jumping from a multistorey car park in July 2013. He became ill shortly after taking on a new job and was diagnosed with depression and psychosis. He was admitted to an assessment ward at Bedford Hospital but discharged after three weeks back to the care of the crisis resolution and home treatment team. His wife, Linda, said: \"They hadn't done a formal care plan to decide what his treatment should be going forward. They just released him.\" Ten days after being discharged, while on a shopping trip with Linda and his daughter Emily, he jumped to his death. The coroner said he \"required treatment as an inpatient but no bed was available\". South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, which was responsible for Graeme's care said: \"The circumstances surrounding Mr Price's care were thoroughly investigated, robust action was taken to address the issues identified and the learning was shared with clinical teams.\" According to the most recent report from the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, investment in the key community teams set up to replace inpatient care has fallen. Between 2010-11 and 2011-12, investment across the three priority areas - crisis resolution, early intervention and assertive outreach - fell for the first time, by £29.3m from £520m. Her annual report notes this is \"significant\" given \"the co-existing reduction in bed availability\". Chris Naylor, of health think tank the King's Fund, said there is evidence that mental health is underfunded compared with physical healthcare, despite recent government promises to ensure parity of esteem. \"Mental health accounts for about 23% of the burden of disease in England, but it only receives around 11% of the funding. \"If the government is serious about putting mental health care on an equal footing with physical health, then it's going to need a really serious commitment in the next parliament.\" A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"Commissioners are expected to give a real-terms funding increase to mental health this year. \"NHS funding for mental health increased by £300m last year.\"",

A new \"UK settled status\" will grant those who have spent five years in the UK equal rights on healthcare, education, benefits and pensions. Guaranteeing EU citizens' rights is the top priority for the EU delegation negotiating Brexit. Before Mrs May's offer, the EU proposed that EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). There are two other thorny issues that have to be resolved early on - the UK's divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border. An estimated 3.2 million EU citizens live in the UK and there is much nervousness - some even fear deportation. Mrs May sought to reassure the UK's 27 EU partners, saying the UK \"does not want anyone here to have to leave, nor does it want families to be split up\". Her Brexit statement took up little of the summit's time. There was no debate as the EU is anxious to avoid any splits emerging. The UK election left Mrs May seriously weakened, heading a minority government, which has fuelled uncertainty about the whole Brexit process. The UK's exit deadline is 30 March 2019. A cut-off date for obtaining \"UK settled status\" is yet to be announced. EU citizens who settle in the UK before Brexit will get a grace period to reach the five-year minimum for residency - but only if they arrive before the cut-off date. There are categories of people whose status may remain unclear, such as children, carers, students and Irish citizens. Ireland has a special relationship with the UK, including a Common Travel Area. The UK is anxious to start negotiating a new trade deal soon, but the EU has already won the argument that its Brexit priorities must be addressed first. As the summit got under way, European Council President Donald Tusk emphasised that the door to the UK staying in the EU was still open. Quoting John Lennon's Imagine, he said: \"You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that as an Anglophile, \"I hate Brexit from every angle.\" \"It is crucially important we know what Britain wants from Brexit,\" he warned. The Netherlands is one of the UK's closest EU allies, with a similar stance on free trade. Mrs May has vowed to take the UK out of both the EU single market and the customs union. But there are many voices - including in her Conservative Party - pressing for a softer approach. \"I hope we'll come to some form of continued [UK] membership or relationship with the internal market,\" Mr Rutte said. \"I absolutely believe the UK will be hit in the economy and the pound very hard.\" Counter-terrorism has also been a key issue at the summit which comes in the wake of an attack in Brussels on Tuesday. Several EU states have been attacked in recent weeks, including the UK, France and Sweden, and Mrs May said that an attack against any member state was an attack on all. The 28 leaders agreed to put legal pressure on internet giants like Google, Twitter and Facebook to remove jihadist content faster and more proactively. Mr Tusk said the bloc was calling on social media companies to do whatever was necessary to prevent the spread of terrorist material and was prepared to pass new legislation. \"This means developing new tools to detect and remove material automatically,\" he said. The EU wants the industry to help tackle the problem of attackers slipping under the radar by using apps with end-to-end encryption.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The Uzbek government announced his death on Friday after a period of rumours about his ill health. As is often the case with strongman regimes, no tried and tested succession mechanism is in place in Uzbekistan, and the transition of power may well be a complicated process. Uzbekistan is the most populous Central Asian country and has the largest army. Mr Karimov, who came to power during the Soviet era, has led the country since independence in 1991. During his long rule, President Karimov has built a relatively stable secular regime in a region threatened by Islamist radicalism. But many believe this has been done at the expense of human rights, and has often been an excuse to hound legitimate opposition. It also has not completely eradicated the long-term risk posed by Islamist militancy. Many Uzbek Islamists have simply dodged the tight security at home by fighting for the Islamic State group abroad, but should the secular government weaken, they might be tempted to come back. Some also say that Uzbekistan's fractured and exiled opposition may turn to Islamism to boost its appeal in the majority Muslim country. Positioned on the ancient Great Silk Road between Europe and Asia, Uzbekistan enjoys a strategic location that has attracted the interest of many foreign states throughout its long history. Most recently, it has been one reason why Russia and Western powers have been vying for a foothold. In 2001, Uzbekistan allowed the US to use its air bases in support of military action in Afghanistan, but four years later all foreign troops were evicted following Washington's criticism of the Uzbek government's human rights record. Moscow will be keen to ensure that Mr Karimov's successor leans towards Russia rather than the West. So far, unlike most Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan has been wary of Russian influence. In 2012, it withdrew from the main Russia-led regional military bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Political instability caused by Mr Karimov's demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan's borders. The country is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold, and any turbulence may push up the price of these commodities on world markets. Tension could could also spill over into Uzbekistan's energy-rich neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Regional transport corridors may be disrupted, including gas and oil pipelines running to Russia and China. Uzbekistan also supplies electricity to Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and southern Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan lies on key opium routes from Afghanistan to Russia and on to Europe, and drug smugglers could take advantage of instability to distract or disrupt law-enforcement efforts. President Karimov has never been shy of deploying his powerful security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power. This, among other things, has enabled him to maintain a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country. Should it be upset, the ripple effect may be felt as far away as in China. Uzbekistan hosts a sizeable Uighur community, and the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China has long been seen as a source of concern by Beijing. President Karimov's successor will also inherit unresolved border differences with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The reconstruction of the event 66 million years ago was made possible by drilling into the remnant bowl and analysing its rocks. These show how the space impactor made the hard surface of the planet slosh back and forth like a fluid. At one stage, a mountain higher than Everest was thrown up before collapsing back into a smaller range of peaks. \"And this all happens on the scale of minutes, which is quite amazing,\" Prof Joanna Morgan from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News. The researchers report their account in this week's edition of Science Magazine. Their study confirms a very dynamic, very energetic model for crater formation, and will go a long way to explaining the resulting cataclysmic environmental changes. The debris thrown into the atmosphere likely saw the skies darken and the global climate cool for months, perhaps even years, driving many creatures into extinction, not just the dinosaurs. The team spent April to May this year drilling a core through the so-called Chicxulub Crater, now buried under ocean sediments off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth. The researchers targeted a particular zone in the 200km-wide bowl known as the \"peak ring\", which - if earlier ideas were correct - should have contained the rocks that moved the greatest distance in the impact. These would have been dense granites lifted from almost 10km down. And that is precisely what the team found. \"Once we got through the impact melt on top, we recovered pink granite. It was so obvious to the eye - like what you would expect to see in a kitchen countertop,\" recalled Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US. But these were not normal granites, of course. They were deformed and fractured at every scale - visibly in the hand and even down at the level of the rock's individual mineral crystals. Evidence of enormous stress, of having experienced colossal pressures. The analysis of the core materials now fits an astonishing narrative. This describes the roughly 15km-wide stony asteroid instantly punching a cavity in the Earth's surface some 30km deep and 80-100km across. Unstable, and under the pull of gravity, the sides of this depression promptly started to collapse inwards. At the same time, the centre of the bowl rebounded, briefly lifting rock higher than the Himalayas, before also falling down to cover the inward-rushing sides of the initial hole. \"If this deep-rebound model is correct (it's called the dynamic collapse model), then our peak ring rocks should be the rocks that have travelled farthest in the impact - first, outwards by kilometres, then up in the air by over 10km, and back down and outwards by another, say, 10km. So their total travel path is something like 30km, and they do that in under 10 minutes,\" Prof Gulick told the BBC's Science in Action programme. Imagine a sugar cube dropped into a cup of tea. The drink's liquid first gets out of the way of the cube, moves back in and up, before finally slopping down. When the asteroid struck the Earth, the rocks it hit also behaved like a fluid. \"These rocks must have lost their strength and cohesion, and very dramatically had their friction reduced,\" said Prof Morgan. \"So, yes, temporarily, they behave like a fluid. It's the only way you can make a crater like this.\" One of the important outcomes of the research is that it provides a useful template also to understand the surfaces of other planets. All the terrestrial worlds and even Earth's Moon are scarred with craters just like Chicxulub. And knowing how rocks can move vertically and horizontally in an impact will assist scientists as they attempt to interpret similar crustal features seen elsewhere in the Solar System. The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. In 2013, the Italian composer was reported as saying he wouldn't work with Tarantino because he \"places music in his films without coherence\". But the 87-year-old told the BBC he had no issues with how the director incorporated his older works into films like Kill Bill and Django Unchained. \"On the contrary, I was very, very flattered,\" he said. \"The fact that my music, which had been written for other films, could be adapted to the poetry of Quentin Tarantino's film-making was a great gift for me. \"The only thing I criticised of Quentin Tarantino was a single scene in a single movie which, for me, was too violent and too ghastly. I couldn't watch it.\" Speaking through an interpreter, the maestro said his original comments had been mis-reported, adding: \"People should pay a lot of attention when they write something down.\" The pair have now collaborated for the first time, with the Italian maestro penning the soundtrack for Tarantino's upcoming film The Hateful Eight. It marks the first time the composer has scored a Western since his career-defining work with Sergio Leone on films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also a first for Tarantino - who has never commissioned a full orchestral score for one of his films before, preferring to rely on old soundtracks and classic pop records. Morricone says it was Tarantino's dense script that persuaded him to work on the project. \"It was this thick,\" he says, indicating a document several times thicker than War and Peace.  \"He actually came to Rome just to convince me, to my house. \"It was very easy for me to say yes because the script was very, very relevant and interesting and full of detail.\" The Hateful Eight, which is released in January, reunites Tarantino with several of his regular players - Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern - as well as newcomers Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir and Channing Tatum. Set roughly a decade after the US Civil War, it finds an eclectic group of law-keepers, outlaws, mercenaries, bounty hunters and fugitives trapped in a stagecoach waypoint by a massive snowstorm. As the plot unfurls, they begin to wonder whether they'll make it out alive. The score's key movement is a seven-minute suite called L'Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud. \"The main instruments introducing this piece are the bassoon, the contra-bassoon and the tuba,\" he says. \"And this is very strange because I have never done that in the past. \"The sound these instruments produce can express the drama, the rage, the despair and the irony that are the main themes of Tarantino's story. They are a healthy, bodily sound. They also express a criticism towards the leading characters of the film.\" A sinister, brooding passage of music, it will form the centrepiece of the composer's world tour next year, celebrating his 60 years in the film industry. Despite his age - and the lingering pain from a back injury he sustained last year - Morricone says he is \"looking forward\" to the concerts, and finds playing themes from films such as  The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and A Fistful of Dollars an \"incredibly gratifying experience\". The composer has scored more than 500 films, sold more than 70 million albums, scored a top 10 single in the UK (with Chi Mai in 1982) and received an honorary Oscar - but he has no intention of resting on his laurels. \"I've been working for many years and the sum of all these experiences led me always to improve, to do better,\" he says. \"Every piece of work I do adds something to my experience and my style, and brings something new.\" And had he been able to stomach the violence in Tarantino's latest movie? \"The fact I don't like those sequences is not a problem. It's a question of my personal sensitivity,\" he says. \"I would go to the extent to say that maybe he can afford to include those violent sequences because it's part of his poetry. \"The world can be a very cruel place and he has a wonderful way of describing this cruelty.\" The Hateful Eight is out in the UK on 8 January.

We have the pathways getting better at clubs and international level. \"We've introduced an Under-15s, 18s and 20s in the past 12 months because we recognise we need to give our players more big-game experience. \"You've seen at this tournament we need players who are able to make decisions at the top level in the big games in order to win tournaments.

Former QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who won one cap for England, said the \"culture is rotten\" in English football, and criticised the power of the Premier League clubs. \"There doesn't seem to be the pride there once was at representing England at any level or a major tournament,\" he told BBC 5 live. \"We have a talent pool to match any nation. It's not the players or coaching staff. It's not one thing, it's an accumulation of many things. \"The culture in English football isn't changing. No St George's Park, no massive spend, no changing coach will change it. The culture is rotten from top to bottom. The England national team will underperform at every single tournament for this reason. \"The players think 'I'm too good for the under-21s, I've been in a senior squad - I don't want to go to a major tournament. I need to rest because I want to play in the Europa League or Champions League next year'. \"Or 'hang on it's better for my career not to go to this tournament'. Or their managers are saying it. That's the problem with the Premier League being stronger than the FA. It's impossible for England to build good teams. \"The FA should say to them if you don't make yourself eligible for the under-21s, then you won't be considered for the national team for however many years. \"I feel for Dan Ashworth, I feel sorry for Gareth Southgate, I feel sorry for Roy Hodgson. What they are trying to do is so difficult until they get the Premier League back in line.\" Former England defender Danny Mills has been on an FA commission set up to assess potential improvements to English football. He said it could take a decade for major improvements to come to fruition, and also suggested English players earning too much is to blame. \"We looked at this as a commission and decided things needed to change. Gareth has only been in the job two years. Things don't change overnight. Changing the way England play and players develop will take 10 years at least. That's what the Germans had to do before becoming very successful. \"Do they get too much too soon? It's very difficult for the coaching staff. Raheem Sterling doesn't want to play for Liverpool - he certainly would have caused more problems for the under-21s than he would have done them good. \"When me and Joey were coming through, playing for the under-21s and national team was massive kudos. \"That doesn't happen now, they're given so much so early in club football that England Under-21s has become secondary. There isn't the same desire to play for them. Spain and Germany still have the desire to play for their Under-21s - they get paid an awful lot less than our players. \"English players are paid too much and clubs put pressure on them not to go to the tournament - 'We want to save you for next season'. We have to change this culture. \"I can't believe players even consider not playing for the under-21s. Those players like Barkley or Sterling could have called Gareth up and said 'I want to be in your side'.\" You can listen to BBC Radio 5 live's Dan Ashworth interview and the reaction to the England Under-21s' performance from Joey Barton and Danny Mills here.",

Mr Gove said he regretted standing for the Tory leadership, saying he made \"mistakes\" in the way he withdrew his support from Boris Johnson. He now had to take the consequences of his decision, including the fact that an act of treachery has become widely known as \"doing a Gove\", he said. The 49-year-old former justice secretary made the comments during an interview with Fern Britton, to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday. He appeared to suggest he had not given up on a return to front-line politics, saying he hoped to \"make a contribution\" in the future. Mr Gove said his decision to back Leave in the EU referendum had placed a \"significant strain\" on his relationship with his long-term friend David Cameron. He and his wife, Daily Mail journalist Sarah Vine, had been close friends with Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha - but the two couples have not had a \"proper conversation\" since the 23 June poll, he said. Mr Cameron quit as prime minister after he lost the EU referendum, sparking a leadership campaign which saw Mr Gove back Boris Johnson. He then changed his mind and decided to run himself, publicly questioning Mr Johnson's ability to do the job. Mr Gove would not reveal what Mr Johnson said to him when they spoke after he withdrew his support, but he conceded that \"the way in which I declared my stand for the leadership, I shouldn't have done it that way\". \"As I look back on that time, I think that there were mistakes that I made... \"I also think that my initial instinct that I was not the best person to put themselves forward as a potential prime minister, well most of my colleagues agreed.\" After Mrs May entered Downing Street, Mr Johnson entered the cabinet as foreign secretary, while Mr Gove remains on the Conservative backbenches. \"When Theresa May became prime minister she said that she no longer had a place for me in the cabinet and, to be honest, if I'd been in her shoes I would have sacked me too,\" said Mr Gove. \"So I entirely accept that sacking me at the time was the right thing to do. \"I had six years when I was a government minister. I had a chance to make a difference - I hope that I did.\" But he conceded that \"nothing is forever in politics\". \"I have to accept that the way in which I spent the final week or so of my ministerial life involved my making mistakes and having made mistakes you have to take the consequences.\" Mr Gove said he is now focusing on his work on the Commons committee on exiting the EU and wanted to campaign for children at risk of abuse or neglect.

He denied five charges of rape and six other sexual offences but was unanimously convicted by the jury at Mold Crown Court on 9 December. Sentencing him on Wednesday, Judge Rhys Rowlands said Beales had destroyed his victim's childhood. His victim, now aged in her 30s, took to the witness stand to read her victim impact statement. The court heard the abuse began when she was aged six and continued for about 10 years. She said she had wanted to commit suicide and hoped, when she confronted Beales last summer, it would bring some kind of closure. But she said it had not and she was still on strong medication for depression and anxiety, and was awaiting counselling. The court had heard she confronted Beales at his home and he admitted in front of her mother and his wife he had groped her as a child. He later said \"that was what men did\". The woman said every time she came into contact with Beales he made hurtful comments. She said: \"Once again I felt suicidal and felt I could not continue suffering while he was living a happy and carefree life, with no apparent suffering.\" The woman said one of her biggest wishes in life was to start a family. But she added: \"I worry that there may be internal physical damage due to the abuse which may mean I am unable to conceive or carry a child to full term.\" She said she felt she could not trust anyone and saw the world \"as a very dangerous place\". \"I am hyper vigilant when kids are left unattended or unsupervised around men,\" she told the court. \"I feel unable to relax, and as though I have a responsibility to be watchful over others.\" Defending barrister Andrew Green said Beales had no previous convictions and accepted some acts had taken place but he denied other allegations including all the rapes. Jailing him, Judge Rowlands said Beales did not have \"an ounce of remorse\" and was \"devoid of any moral compass at all\". He will have to serve a further 12 months on licence. Det Insp William Jones, of North Wales Police, said: \"John (Jack) Beales was a manipulative and depraved sexual predator who committed multiple offences over a sustained period of time. He is now thankfully behind bars. \"No child should ever have to experience what the victim went through.\" An NSPCC Wales spokesman said the victim \"must be commended for showing incredible bravery in reporting what happened to her so Beales could eventually face justice for his crimes\".",

Bellfield, 47, was given a whole-life prison sentence in June 2011 for murdering the schoolgirl. Surrey Police confirmed it had received a letter from Bellfield's solicitors but said it was standing by its statement on the confession. Milly was kidnapped while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Ms Cooper said Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim, believed a \"covert tape\" may have been used to record his response to a police interview in prison. She said \"my client denies giving a confession\". She has written to Surrey Police requesting the tape recording and notes from the meeting. Ms Cooper said Bellfield contacted her very soon after Surrey Police distributed its press statement relating to the Dowler case. She said Bellfield denies all the crimes for which he has been convicted. Last month, Surrey Police revealed Bellfield had made the admission during an investigation into whether he had an accomplice involved in the abduction and rape, but not murder, of Milly. The force said it stood by its original statement. A police source speaking to the BBC would not comment on how the admission was recorded. Milly's body was found 25 miles away from where she was kidnapped, in Yateley Heath, Hampshire. Experts could not say how she died. Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and murdering the teenager following a trial at the Old Bailey where a judge described him as a \"cruel and pitiless killer\". He was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, when he went on trial accused of killing Milly. He lived 50 yards from where Milly vanished but did not become a suspect until he was arrested by police in London for the other crimes in 2004.

    "document": "They will consider plans by Third Energy to frack a well at a site near the village of Kirby Misperton in the district of Ryedale. Campaigners say approval would set a \"dangerous precedent\". But the company says its operations are no risk to people or the environment. Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into rocks deep underground to unlock trapped gas. The process was banned in 2011 after the shale gas firm Cuadrilla caused minor earth tremors when it fracked a well in Lancashire. Third Energy has licences to produce gas in North Yorkshire and offshore in the North Sea. In 2013 it drilled an exploratory well near the village of Kirby Misperton, close to the North York Moors National Park. It now wants to frack the well to test whether it can unlock shale gas from rocks up to 10,000ft (3,000m) underground. \"All we want to do is test whether gas will flow from an existing well using hydraulic fracturing,\" says Rasik Valand, chief executive of Third Energy. \"What we are planning is safe. There is no risk to the environment or the public.\" But there has been strong opposition to the plan from the local community and environmentalists. Hundreds of anti-fracking protesters are expected to gather outside the council meeting in Northallerton on Friday. The council has received more than 4,000 representations, the vast majority against the proposal. Green campaigners fear that approval here would open the door for fracking elsewhere. \"It risks setting a dangerous precedent for Britain,\" says Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth. \"We strongly urge councillors to reject this planning application which is clearly deeply unpopular with the local community.\" Others are concerned about the impact on the local economy as Kirby Misperton is also home to Flamingo Land, one of Yorkshire's top tourists attractions. \"This place is beautiful,\" says retired bishop, the Right Reverend Graham Cray, who lives in the village. \"The economy is based on tourism and agriculture. Tourists don't come to a gas field and that is what we will turn into if we get the scale of fracking that is intended.\" Last year Lancashire County Council rejected Cuadrilla's plan to carry out exploratory drilling and fracking at two new sites on the Fylde. A planning inquiry into that application took place earlier this year. A recommendation will be sent in the summer to the communities secretary for a final decision. The Third Energy application involves an existing site that has produced gas since the 1990s. The well has already been drilled. The shale gas produced will also be sent through a network of pipes to a nearby power station. That will avoid air pollution caused by flaring gas. So the company expects the fracking activity to be completed within eight weeks. The council's planning officer has recommended that the application be approved. But it is now down to the 11 councillors on the planning committee to take the final decision. That decision may not come until Monday due to the number of people who have registered to speak at the meeting. If approved, fracking could start by the end of the year. The Department of Energy and Climate Change refused to comment on Third Energy's application ahead of the council meeting. But in a statement it said: \"Shale gas is a fantastic opportunity which will create jobs, boost our economy and strengthen our energy security. \"There is tough regulation in place to ensure that fracking can take place safely - now is the time to start exploration and find out just how much shale gas is there and how much we can get out of the ground.\" You can follow John on Twitter at @JohnMoylanBBC.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. BBC director general Tony Hall set out plans for the next decade, saying the corporation will become an \"open BBC for the internet age\". A children's iPlayer and a pool of local reporters who will share work with local newspapers are also planned. Yet he said funding cuts would mean the loss or reduction of some services. Lord Hall laid out the plans at the Science Museum on Monday, ahead of the BBC's charter renewal in 2016. Citing the importance of \"excellence without arrogance\", he said his plans did not signal \"an expansionist BBC\". He did warn, however, that funding cuts would mean it would \"inevitably have to either close or reduce some services\", without specifying which areas might be under threat. New initiatives will include an Ideas Service, which Lord Hall said would be an \"open online platform\" featuring material from galleries, museums and universities as well as the corporation itself. He said: \"Our new, open BBC will act as a curator bringing the best from Britain's great cultural institutions and thinkers to everyone. \"Britain has some of the greatest cultural forces in the world. We want to join with them, working alongside them, to make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world. \"We are extremely ambitious for this new service. \"Where Google's mission is to organise the world's information, ours in a smaller way would be to understand it. We will work with anyone who can help us understand this ever more complex world.\" The government launched a consultation on the BBC's Royal Charter, which sets out the purpose of the BBC and how it will be governed, in July, promising to ask \"hard questions\" about the corporation's size and ambition. Other BBC plans include:. The director general also said he wanted to enable \"producers, directors, writers, artists to have the creative freedom to do things they would find it harder to do elsewhere\". Quality drama will also be a priority, he said, and the BBC will make \"bigger and bolder series\" that will be made available on the iPlayer in their entirety. Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox also announced a science strand named The New Age of Wonder, which will be part of the Ideas Service and will be created in partnership with organisations like the Royal Institution. \"This is not an expansionist BBC\" is perhaps the key political line in today's announcements.  This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is \"imperial in its ambitions\" made by Chancellor George Osborne (along with several newspapers). Partnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co-operation rather than competition. The second theme can be seen most clearly in the plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to \"binge\" watch. The BBC is in a global marketplace - Netflix, Amazon, Google, Apple and HBO - the traditional media landscape is being blown apart. The BBC's problem is looking after its core audience and responding to a technological transformation.  It will take money and the BBC has just taken a Â£650m cut.  Those \"tough choices\" mentioned in the speech is the theme that has not yet been announced. Lord Hall described the recent agreement by the BBC to cover the Â£600m cost of providing free television licences for over-75s as a \"tough deal\" that would require \"some very difficult choices\" to be made. He said: \"Having already saved 40% of the BBC's revenues in this charter period, we must save close to another 20% over the next five years.\" Details of how those savings will be made and which services might be under threat will be announced in the coming months, he added. In a charter review proposals document published on Monday, however, the BBC suggests that \"some existing services\" might no longer be needed in future. \"Streaming news may replace rolling news,\" the document states. \"Children may prefer iPlay to scheduled television. The Ideas Service might mean we no longer need BBC Four.\" Later in the same document, though, the BBC states \"it is too early to be specific about the service changes that we will need to make.\" The BBC's plans for \"a network of 100 public service reporters across the country\" did not find favour with the Scottish Newspaper Society, who labelled the proposal \"a Trojan horse which will undermine long-established publications and destroy local news agencies\". \"Instead of helping local news publishers, it would make the BBC even more powerful and would further concentrate coverage of news in the hands of the state-funded broadcaster,\" said its director John McLellan. The News Media Association, which represents national, regional and local news media organisations across the UK, expressed similar concerns, saying the corporation's proposals represented \"BBC expansion into local news provision and recruitment of more BBC local journalists through the back door\". \"The local newspaper sector already employs thousands of journalists and is the only reliable source of independent and trusted local news across the UK,\" said its vice chairman Ashley Highfield. \"There is no deficit which the BBC needs to plug.\" \"Under the guise of being helpful, the BBC would end up replacing independent local news services,\" Mr McLellan told Radio 4's The World at One earlier, calling the plan \"a further expansion of the BBC's encroachment\". Yet this accusation was rejected by James Purnell, the BBC's director of strategy, who told the same programme it was \"very much not the goal\" for the BBC to \"take over all local journalism\".",

    "document": "It found children of minority families do not get enough support to learn Cantonese - putting them behind in school and causing long-term problems in the jobs market. \"One of the main barriers to equal access has been a de facto racial segregation of ethnic minority students from Chinese students in the public school system,\" says University of Hong Kong law professor, Puja Kapai, who carried out the study. The practice of communities studying separately has also meant that children grow up without interacting with other cultures. Hong Kong is home to 365,000 ethnic minority people, making up 6% of its total population. Communities of Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese and Filipinos have lived in Hong Kong for generations. But the city still lacks a curriculum for children speaking Chinese as a second language, which would enable them to learn Cantonese, a requirement for many jobs and university places. \"The language requirement that forms a barrier for ethnic minorities to receive equal access in education and the labour market, can be seen as an indirect form of discrimination,\" says Raymond Ho, a senior member of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong. But he is confident that since the government made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of race in 2009, there is more public awareness of the needs of ethnic minorities. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch. In the past there have been claims that Chinese locals are \"less accepting\" of people with darker skin. That was the claim of a report in 2008 from Unison, a group that campaigns for the rights of ethnic minorities. This acceptance level was found to be lowest in the education sector. Language is a major barrier for ethnic minorities to access education. The best place to start learning Chinese and meeting people of other backgrounds is in kindergarten, says Holing Yip from Unison. But Unison's study Kindergarten Support Report 2015 showed that 62% of kindergartens used Cantonese exclusively as the interview language. It also found that privately-run kindergartens were reluctant to give application forms to non-Chinese parents, and many ask children to have Chinese speaking skills by age three. As a result, there is a concentration of ethnic minorities in a small number of kindergartens. Mr Ho says the Equal Opportunities Commission has been \"encouraging kindergartens to be open to ethnic minorities.  But also not to use language ability as a selection criteria\". There has been a pattern of Chinese students enrolling in mainstream primary and secondary schools, where classes are taught in Cantonese. Ethnic minorities would enrol in English-medium \"designated schools\". But the designated schools equipped students with such a low level of Cantonese that they would find it hard to enter university or employment. As such some parents choose to send their children to Cantonese-medium schools. \"Having struggled themselves, many ethnic minority parents want their children to learn Cantonese so they don't go through what they did,\" says Ms Yip. But getting information about how to apply to Chinese-medium schools is often only available in Chinese. Some have discouraged ethnic minority parents from applying. Those who get places can struggle, as all classes are in Cantonese with no extra support in class and parents are unable to help at home. Many parents are forced to seek extra tuition to help children with homework. \"There are situations where if a tutor can't come one day, their children won't be able to hand in their homework and will be penalised. It's also a huge financial burden,\" says Ms Yip. Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani attended both types of schools. \"I learnt more Chinese in the mainstream school where all my friends were Chinese, just by practising it outside of class, than I did at the designated school where I studied Cantonese as a language class.\" After pressure from local non-governmental organisations and the United Nations, the Hong Kong government disbanded designated schools in 2013. But the tendency to send ethnic minority children to particular schools continues. \"Ultimately, parents are faced with the decision of whether their children should suffer now in a Chinese-medium school, or later in the labour market. And that's not a fair choice for a parent to have to make,\" says Ms Yip. In September 2014, the Hong Kong government took a step forward by introducing a \"learning framework\" aimed at supporting ethnic minority students in learning Cantonese. Depending on the number of ethnic minority students enrolled, schools can receive from HK$800,000 (Â£68,000) to HK$1,500,000 to help them. But Prof Kapai is sceptical about its effectiveness. \"It has simply broken the curriculum down into steps, but nothing has actually changed. There needs to be a Chinese as a second language curriculum to teach non-native speakers how to learn Cantonese properly,\" she says. \"Ethnic minorities may still be struggling with subjects such as maths as a result of the class and material being in Chinese,\" says Unison's Ms Yip. Prof Kapai's report emphasises interlinked problems for minority groups. A lack of Cantonese language skills will present barriers in employment, leading to an increase in poverty, and difficulty accessing healthcare. Cantonese language proficiency is a core requirement for some jobs, such as the civil service. Typical occupations taken up by ethnic minorities are in the catering, construction and manual labour industries. The Hong Kong Council of Social Welfare says that many Pakistani, Indonesian and Thai households are below the city's poverty rate. \"I identify as a Hongkonger,\" says Mr Nebhwani. But he is excluded from many jobs because of the limitations of his language skills. \"If I were to try and completely integrate, it would be hard because of my level of Cantonese.\" \"The government is committed to encouraging and supporting non-Chinese speaking students' integration into the community, including facilitating their early adaptation to the school education system and mastery of the Chinese language,\" said a spokesperson for Hong Kong's education bureau.",

The plant will create 150 jobs on the Ebbw Vale enterprise zone, which is still hoping to be home to the Â£325m Circuit of Wales. New owners, who bought the British brand three years ago, will start production next year. The company has a 10-year plan, including four new models, and will begin making a few hundred cars a year. TVR had been looking at three sites around the UK. Mr Jones said: \"This is yet another fantastic high profile investment for Wales and a great boost for our automotive sector. \"TVR is another iconic and much loved, world-class brand that still commands a strong and loyal international following. I am delighted the next generation of TVRs will proudly bear the label Made in Wales.\" There have been 350 advance orders for the car already, after images of what it might look like were released late last year. TVR chairman Les Edgar  said: \"This is a fantastic opportunity both for TVR and the Welsh Government. \"South Wales is becoming a major hub for automotive and motor sport technology and development and I am delighted TVR is investing here.\" The company hopes to be producing around 2,000 cars a year by 2022, targeting the UK and selected European markets initially. It will initially assemble the car in Ebbw Vale - bringing in the V8 engines from Cosworth in Northampton. Former F1 designer Gordon Murray is behind iStream carbon technology to give the new models extra strength. THE HISTORY OF THE TVR. Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent. The automotive industry in Wales already includes 40 component manufacturers and more than 100 other firms in the supply chain. Ford and Toyota have engine plants and Aston Martin recently announced plans to assemble a new model in the Vale of Glamorgan. The Welsh Automotive Forum estimates 18,000 people work in the sector in Wales, with sales worth Â£3.2bn a year. But the impact of the sector is greater than just the number of people working in it. On the whole it's an industry that pays well. On top of that it has to be innovative. It is continually having to improve design and models to make vehicles cleaner and more efficient. Component makers also have to keep looking at the way they themselves work so they keep winning contracts to supply the car makers. As a result, it is an industry that tends to be high on training and big on investment in its people and machines. That means it is of more benefit to the Welsh economy than the same number of workers in other industries. TVR will bring much needed jobs to the Heads of the Valleys and a simplified assembly process, so its factory only needs to be 20% of the size of a conventional plant. It estimates this could reduce capital investment in the assembly plant by around 80%. The first minister would not be drawn on how the Welsh Government had supported the deal. But he said the news, hot on the heels of the Aston Martin announcement \"sends out a strong, clear message that Wales is the location of choice for advanced manufacturing\". Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said it showed the Welsh automotive industry was \"surging from strength to strength.\" He added: \"Today's news is yet another strong endorsement of the quality of Britain's car industry, which has been creating jobs, taking on apprentices and contributing to building a stronger economy.\" Although an impression of the new car was released last year, the design of the first new vehicle is still under wraps with plans to unveil it towards the end of 2016, with production starting next year. Circuit of Wales chief executive Martin Whitaker welcomed the news as \"fantastic\" for the region. \"Paired with Aston Martin's recent announcement, it reinforces our vision of Ebbw Vale and the south Wales region growing into a cluster of excellence for automotive and related industries,\" he added.",

Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde highlighted England's Joe Marler is a frequent infringer at the scrum. \"He definitely needs to scrummage legally otherwise we will be pointing our finger,\" said McBryde.

The money will be distributed to \"community-led\" groups to encourage the building of affordable housing. Labour's John Healey said last year saw the lowest level of new affordable homes built since 1991. The government says second-home ownership is at an all-time high and is crowding out first-time buyers by artificially raising prices. It reports that there were 340,000 second homes in England in 2013/14 - a rise of 98,000 in five years. In March the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced that £60m raised by an additional 3% on stamp duty on second homes would be spent on \"community-led housing developments in coastal and rural communities\". The Department for Communities and Local Government said the £60m fund had since been broadened out to include areas with high levels of second homes or where the affordability gap was a particular problem. It announced that the South West is set to get £19,125,110. This will be split between 25 local authorities in Devon, Cornwall, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset and the Isles of Scilly. The South East - outside London - will receive the second highest amount, £11,336,157. The East of England will get £8.9m, Yorkshire and Humberside £6.4m and the North-West nearly £6m. Friday's breakdown also includes £2.3m for London, as well as shares for the East Midlands (£2.7m). West Midlands (£1.9m) and north-east England (£1.3m). In all, 150 councils will share the money over five years, to be distributed to community-led housing groups to spend on building and the development of house-building skills.. Cornelius Olivier, a Labour councillor in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5live: \"We have a big problem in Cornwall in that the gap between what people can earn and what housing costs is bigger than almost anywhere else in the country and one of the main reasons is because we have over 10,000 second homes in Cornwall.\" Housing Minister Gavin Barwell said: \"The high number of second homes can be a frustration for many who struggle to find an affordable home in their community. \"This new fund will help tackle that by boosting supply and making sure community groups are at the heart of delivering new homes, so that this is a country that works for everyone.\" During the first year of the scheme, funding will focus on improving skills and reviewing housing needs in different areas. It \"must then be used to deliver housing on the ground for local people\" during the second year. But Labour's Mr Healey said: \"Another day, another announcement but still the lowest level of new affordable homes built last year since 1991. \"After six years of failure on housing, people want to see government ministers get to grips with the country's housing crisis not produce more press releases.\" Councillor Martin Tett, for the Local Government Association,.

Former heavyweight world champion Haye, 36, made a series of graphic descriptions of hurting Bellew, with the BBBofC warning both fighters. Bellew, 34, stopped Haye in round 11, with the Londoner subsequently having surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon. \"Some of the comments went too far,\" Haye told BBC Sport. It is expected that any sanctions against Haye will be announced after a BBBofC meeting on Wednesday. \"If I have to pay a fine, I'll happily pay and take whatever punishment I need to,\" he said. Haye added he now has a \"different kind of respect\" for WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew and would not repeat such comments before a rematch, which he reiterated his desire to pursue. \"When you get into that beast mode before the fight, you're not thinking about political correctness, you're not thinking about fines, you're just thinking about getting in the ring,\" he said. \"When you're in that beast mode you say things which rub the average person up the wrong way.\" Haye suffered an Achilles injury in the sixth round at the O2 Arena, with Bellew capitalising to score a knockdown. A second knockdown in the 11th round saw Haye's corner throw in the towel, which the fighter now believes could have kept him from doing \"irreparable damage\" to his ankle and foot. \"It was a strange situation - I was getting into my flow and it felt like I stepped on a bear trap,\" he said. \"I saw Tony look down and think 'I've got you here,' so it just became about survival - trying not to get knocked out while trying to knock him out on one leg, which is pretty tough. \"I knew it was completely ruptured - the pain was terrible, when I put my foot down I could hear it crunching, but the adrenaline is so high when you're fighting you can conjure up the energy from somewhere to keep going. \"I believed if I landed that one shot I could change the outcome of the fight but I was fighting a current world champion - I gave it my best shot but came up short.\" Bellew said he is considering retirement following his win, but admitted an offer for one further fight could be too lucrative to turn down. Haye admits a rematch \"solely depends on Tony\" but sees a second bout as the first step as he seeks to regain a world heavyweight title belt. \"I still believe it, more now than ever, that if I'm fit and healthy, I can beat anybody,\" he said. \"Maybe [Tony] is happy with the victory over me and if that's the case, I wish him nothing but luck. If he wants to do it again, then great. \"Very few people on the planet believe I'm the best so I need to win that fight again, bare minimum, and then people can maybe look at me for world title fights. \"For me, focus on the leg, and I will become the world heavyweight champion.\"",

In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: \"The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be.\" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as \"work-shy William\". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. \"I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said.

    "document": "That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph). And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days. If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\" Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff. Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday's famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real. To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles. The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes. Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football. For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer. That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks. That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths. Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack. As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space. Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable. More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head. For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up. That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley…who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster. Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort. When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour. As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility. Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\" Robinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be.",

Among them were members of the governing Workers Party and groups which back President Dilma Rousseff. But the names, published in a magazine, also included rivals of Ms Rousseff. Many of the names were published in Veja, one of Brazil's leading magazines, just weeks before the presidential election in which Ms Rousseff is running for a second term in office. Several politicians mentioned have denied involvement. Mr Costa claimed that politicians received 3% commissions on the values of contracts signed with Petrobras when he was working there from 2004 to 2012. He alleged that the scheme was used to buy support for the government in congressional votes. Mr Costa was arrested in 2013. He is now in jail and struck a plea-bargain deal with prosecutors before giving the names. Ahead of the election, Ms Rousseff's approval ratings have been slipping in opinion polls in favour of her rival, former Environment Minister Marina Silva.

The vigils were held on 13 November in Bristol, London, Cape Town and also Sweden where she was born. South African authorities have applied to have Mr Dewani extradited over claims he was involved in her murder. He denies the charges. Taxi driver Zola Tongo from Bothasig, Cape Town, has been jailed for 18 years for murder, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances and perverting the course of justice after agreeing a plea bargain. Mr Dewani, from Bristol, faces charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and obstructing the administration of justice. Mr Dewani's extradition was backed by Home Secretary Theresa May after a judge approved the move in August. An appeal has been lodged with the High Court. Mrs Dewani's uncle, Manoj Panchmatia, who helped organise the vigils, said it had been \"a very difficult year for the family\". \"We are all looking for some form of closure,\" he added. Mr Panchmatia said the idea had come from users of Facebook who wanted to do \"something special\".

We are now focusing elsewhere.\" Team principal Christian Horner said he was doing \"necessary due diligence\" in talking to other manufacturers. With their partnership with Renault disintegrating, the team may be forced to switch to Ferrari engines. Mercedes are understood to be against supplying Red Bull - who are contracted to Renault until 2016 - because they do not want to help a strong rival become more competitive. Media playback is not supported on this device. The German giant is also concerned about what it and many other F1 insiders perceive to be Red Bull's history of antagonistic relationships with engine partners. Red Bull's relationship with Renault has been difficult for some time, and appears to have become untenable in recent months as the team's frustrations with the lack of competitiveness of the French engine boil over. Honda is the only other manufacturer in F1, but partner McLaren would almost certainly exercise their veto over any potential deal with Red Bull, who in any case are not believed to be interested in a deal with the Japanese company at this stage. Renault, which supplies only Red Bull and sister team Toro Rosso in F1, is in the final stages of negotiations to take over the financially troubled Lotus team, although no deal has yet been completed. Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene said the Italian company was prepared to supply Red Bull if necessary. He said he was not concerned about their reputation for being able to build highly-competitive chassis in F1, led by their design chief Adrian Newey. Arrivabene said: \"In theory they have big names, with Newey as chief designer and it is easy to think that if you give them the engine they will build a scary chassis, which means they will be really competitive. \"Concerning my team, my engineers and aerodynamicists know their own jobs. For that reason I don't have a problem, and competition is nice when you have a stronger competitor. \"This doesn't mean tomorrow morning we will give our engines to Red Bull or Toro Rosso. \"But I don't see any kind of problem to give our engine to any other team or be scared of the competition before they start. \"This is not the right spirit of competition or what Ferrari represents.

    "document": "Derek Bruder was giving evidence as the inquests focused on the final movements of 15-year-old Kevin Williams. He said he made his first statement shortly after the 1989 disaster and was visited by police the following year. While the meeting left him \"confused\", he agreed to make changes. The officer concerned, former Insp Matthew Sawers, denied asking Mr Bruder to change the sense of his statement. Mr Bruder told the inquests into the 96 deaths at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 that he was visited by an inspector from West Midlands Police, who were supplying evidence to the first inquests. He said Insp Sawers spent six hours with him. When the officer went to the bathroom, Mr Bruder said he looked through some of his notes. He said he found a sheet of paper divided lengthways in two, with handwritten notes on it. On one side it said \"first statement\" and on the other side it said \"change to\", Mr Bruder said. During the meeting he said he was asked to speak over the phone to a pathologist from the coroner's office. Mr Bruder, who was 22 at the time of the disaster, said he conceded \"to the doctor's medical superiority\" when it was suggested Kevin could not have been alive when Mr Bruder tried to revive him. He agreed to make changes to his original statement. Among them he accepted he may have been mistaken to say he had felt \"a faint pulse\" while trying to save Kevin. Mr Bruder told the jury he was 100% confident he had felt a pulse and had seen the teenager move while lying on the pitch. The court heard he wrote to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2012 to say West Midlands Police had made a \"deliberate attempt\" to make him change his statement. He told the inquests he stood by that view and the inspector who visited him had not been honest with him. Earlier Mr Bruder told the inquests that, along with a St John Ambulance volunteer medic who gave heart massage, he had tried to resuscitate Kevin. He said he was \"absolutely 100% confident\" he felt a pulse in the teenager's neck, adding: \"It was not something that would appear to me to be absolutely healthy, beating vibrantly, but there was definitely a pulse.\" Asked whether he saw any signs of life while giving CPR, Mr Bruder said: \"Well, to me he was alive. There was a faint pulse.\" The jury also heard from two Liverpool fans who tried to help Kevin while Mr Bruder was with him. One of them, Stephen Rankin, said Kevin did not show any signs of life. Mr Bruder said a female St John Ambulance medic eventually joined the group, and took over the CPR. After trying to resuscitate him she said Kevin had died. Mr Sawers, who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police, told the inquests he had been asked by the original coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, to visit Mr Bruder to get further explanation and detail around evidence, including the convulsions and pulse. He was to give a summary of the further statement to the inquests the following day, but denied he had applied pressure on Mr Bruder or had attended with the intention of changing his statement. Mr Sawers said: \"I did not cause him to change the sense of the statement. What I did was to go through the details and to elicit more detail and explanation. \"Everything that I did in my encounter with PC Bruder was done with integrity and with the best of intentions. It wasn't something that I had any personal stake in.\" But Pete Weatherby, representing Kevin's family, suggested there had been \"a determined effort\" to change his statement which was \"inconvenient to the investigation\". Mr Weatherby said that \"it was very inconvenient that here was a serving police officer giving evidence of vital signs in a casualty that died\". He suggested that as a result of the meeting, Mr Sawers came away with a second statement that \"loosened up\" evidence about Kevin's vital signs.

Five Saudis, reportedly including a prince, were detained at Beirut's airport after two tonnes of pills branded as Captagon were found in cases due to be loaded onto a private jet. It was the largest drug smuggling operation yet uncovered at the airport. Captagon pills, which typically contain amphetamine and caffeine, are consumed widely in the Middle East. The drug has helped fuel the conflict in Syria, generating millions of dollars in revenue for producers inside the country as well as being used by combatants to help them keep fighting. NNA reported that 40 bags of Captagon pills were found by inspectors from the Gendarmerie in cases due to be put on board a jet bound for Hael, in northern Saudi Arabia. It did not identify the Saudi citizens who were detained, but sources told the Associated Press and the AFP news agency that they included a Saudi prince. In April 2014, Lebanese security forces foiled an attempt to smuggle 15 million Captagon pills hidden in shipping containers full of corn from Beirut's seaport, according to AFP. Captagon, originally the trade name for the synthetic stimulant fenetylline, was first produced in the 1960s to treat hyperactivity, narcolepsy and depression. However, it was banned in most countries by the 1980s because of it was too addictive. In 2013, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said 64% of global seizures of amphetamine took place in the Middle East, and that most of the amphetamine was in the form of Captagon pills.",

Shorter DNA structures can leave chromosome ends exposed, accelerating cancer progression and drug resistance. The team believe the study could help doctors in choosing the most effective treatment for individual patients. Researchers from the university's School of Medicine said the tests can be used to predict the outcomes of patients with two different types of blood cancer - the bone marrow cancer myeloma and pre-leukaemia myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The latter is a bone marrow disorder often leading to life-threatening bone marrow failure and even acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Results from two studies, which were funded by the charities Bloodwise and Cancer Research UK, have been published in the British Journal of Haematology. The researchers analysed samples from 134 myeloma patients, 80 MDS patients and 95 AML patients as part of the study. Prof Duncan Baird, who led the research, said: \"Our research provides strong evidence that shortening of telomeres [the DNA sections] plays a vital role in the progression of these blood cancers and that a significant number of patients should be receiving different levels of treatment. \"The next step is to assess telomere length in larger studies to establish how it can be integrated into existing assessments that predict patient outcome.\"",

Ukraine's protest leaders. Q&A: Stand-off in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych is due to meet Mr Putin on Friday in Sochi, on the opening day of the Winter Olympic Games there. He held talks in Kiev with US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland on Thursday, at which he said he favoured dialogue and compromise with the opposition. Meanwhile, an audio recording has been posted online, which is purported to be a hacked phone conversation between Ms Nuland and US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, in which the female speaker dismisses EU efforts to resolve the crisis, using an expletive. The two speakers also discuss frankly the merits of the three main Ukrainian opposition leaders in the conversation. The US embassy declined to comment on the tape. Thousands of Ukrainian opposition activists, some carrying shields and baseball bats, marched from their camp on Independence Square in the capital Kiev to parliament in a show of force on Thursday. They came close to government supporters who are camped next to parliament behind barricades manned by hundreds of police, but the march passed off peacefully. In another development, a man received a serious hand injury when he reportedly opened a letter bomb inside one of the buildings occupied by protesters in Kiev, Trade Union House. He was rushed to hospital, police confirmed. Mr Glazyev told Kommersant newspaper's Ukrainian edition: \"According to this document [the memorandum], Russia and the US are guarantors of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and, frankly speaking, they are obliged to intervene when conflict situations of this kind arise.\" The memorandum, which also involved the UK, was signed after Ukraine gave up its claim to any part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal after the dissolution of the USSR. Mr Glazyev, who is widely regarded as Mr Putin's chief adviser on Ukraine, gave a wide-ranging interview to Kommersant. He warned that if the opposition did not end its occupation of Independence Square, which is now into its fourth month, President Yanukovych might have no choice but to use force. \"In a situation when the authorities encounter a coup attempt, they simply have no choice [but to use force],\" he said. \"Otherwise the country will be plunged into chaos.\" Accusing the Americans of \"interfering flagrantly and unilaterally in the internal affairs of Ukraine\", he said: \"There is information that within the grounds of the American embassy, there is training for fighters, that they're arming them.\" Mr Glazyev predicted the situation there would \"normalise\" if the US desisted from intervening. Russia itself has been widely accused of intervening in Ukraine, using its economic clout to persuade President Yanukovych and his allies to abandon closer ties with the EU in favour of Russia and other ex-Soviet states. The current stand-off in the streets began in November after President Yanukovych refused to sign a far-reaching agreement with Brussels at the last moment. It descended into violence last month after a new law to curb protests - which has since been repealed - provoked fury among the opposition. At least three protesters died in the violence, as did at least three police officers, and hundreds of people were injured. The opposition accuses the security forces of abducting and torturing activists. One of these, Dmytro Bulatov, who has been receiving medical treatment in Lithuania, told reporters on Thursday he had been beaten, choked and interrogated in an ordeal lasting eight days. \"I was telling them lies just to stop the torture,\" said Mr Bulatov, 35. \"At one point I asked them to kill me because I couldn't stand it anymore.\"",

By Bethan BellBBC News. About 250 people toasted the unveiling of the gorilla statue in a sunny Oswestry. The British Ironworks Centre had long kept the project under wraps so there was a palpable sense of intrigue and anticipation about what a 12ft high gorilla made entirely of spoons would actually look like. Uri Geller was clearly very pleased with the end result. He even signed bent spoons for a few of the children who came along to the unveiling. While Mr Geller laid down the challenge of creating a giant gorilla, Clive Knowles, managing director of the British Ironworks Centre, said it had been built for the nation and funded by the firm. He said he was hoping the statue would ultimately live somewhere more accessible to the public and that the firm was in contact with Great Ormond Street Hospital as a possible location. Many of the spoons have been sent from as far away as China, India, Kenya, Tahiti and Armenia. Mr Geller, a friend of Prince Michael, himself donated a spoon once owned by Winston Churchill. Speaking at the unveiling, in front of a large crowd, Mr Geller described the statue as \"an amazing piece of art\". He said: \"This will not raise money for charity. It will do something better. It will amaze sick children.\" \"I am not going to look at the gorilla too hard in case the spoons bend,\" he added. \"It has been an amazing day and Clive has made the impossible possible. Sculptor Alfie Bradley, who has hand-welded every spoon to the statue, said he had been amazed at how the appeal for cutlery had taken off on social media. \"Initially we thought we only needed 5,000 spoons, but it's incredibly hard to calculate and it turned out we actually needed 40,000,\" he said. \"It's been incredibly repetitive, but it's been a challenge. The spoons have been different sizes, different metals.\" He said the project had given him \"sleepless nights\" and now \"just the word 'spoon' is enough to drive me crazy\". Mr Bradley added that the gorilla's pose, with one fist breaking out of a cage, had been inspired by the film King Kong. Due to the number of spoons donated by schoolchildren across the world, he said he had come to think of the statue as \"a protector\" of children. Teams from the centre have given presentations at schools in Shropshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire in an appeal for spoons, but the firm soon looked overseas. Mr Knowles said he believed the past five months had cost the firm about Â£120,000 in staff time, but described it as an \"exciting rollercoaster of a ride\". He said the experience had given the firm \"an immense appetite to do something even better\" and appealed to the public to suggest a new project that would \"celebrate Britain\".",

From prison he told his now estranged wife Giulia Masciopinto, 37, to unearth cash buried in their Bedford garden. She has been jailed for nine months. Her mother Caterina De Filippo, 58, and sister Palma De Filippo, 28, were given 12-month sentences for helping her. Domenico Masciopinto was sentenced to 22 months, after admitting concealing criminal property, to run consecutively to his 14-year term. His wife also pleaded guilty to the charge, but the De Filippos, who she enlisted but who denied the accusations, were found guilty last month. Judge Kristina Montgomery QC, sitting at Amersham Law Courts for Aylesbury Crown Court, said the Masciopintos would have been jailed for longer if they had not admitted the crime. Cash was found by police stuffed around the Bedford homes of Giulia Masciopinto, in Redhall Close, and her mother's in Harrowden Road, in March 2013. Officers were alerted by Masciopinto's recorded prison calls to his wife, as he feared the buried cash would perish as it was not in watertight containers. A holdall containing £237,000 was discovered, while thousands of pounds were also found in a handbag, plastic bag and foil-wrapped bundles. Other money had been paid into bank accounts. Palma De Filippo, of High St, Acton, west London, helped by hiding some of the cash in her car boot and laundering it. Det Insp Pushpa Guild, of Bedfordshire Police, called it a \"sophisticated attempt\" to hide criminal proceeds. Police said some seized cash would go towards paying a £121,736 confiscation order, made after Masciopinto was jailed three years ago. However, some notes were unusable as they had turned mouldy due to the way they were stashed.",

But three Ian Madigan penalties kept Leinster within touching distance and they dominated the second half. Mike Ross' close-range try and Madigan's conversion soon after the restart put Leinster into the lead and another Madigan penalty capped the win. Leinster coach Leo Cullen had named a completely new starting XV for the game against the league leaders, his options boosted by the return of half-a-dozen Ireland internationals. Scarlets also had returning World Cup stars, with scrum-half Gareth Davies returning to the fold after Wales duty. The Welsh side took an early grip with a series of drives at the Leinster line that allowed centre Parkes the space to barrel over, his try converted by Dan Jones. Leinster responded to put Scarlets under pressure, with lock Jake Ball sin-binned for overstepping the boundaries during some frantic defence. In his absence Leinster closed the gap with two Madigan penalties, although they lost Rob Kearney to injury and there could be a nervous wait to see if the Ireland full-back is fit for Europe next weekend. Back to full strength, Scarlets stretched away again as number eight John Barclay joined the line to put Owen away for an unconverted try. Madigan added a third penalty but Jones responded in kind to ensure Scarlets took a six-point lead into the break, although it could have been more with Aled Thomas wide with a long-range kick. As well as Scarlets had played, they found themselves behind for the first time within five minutes of the restart as Ross went under almost under the posts for a converted try after a series of forward drives. Media playback is not supported on this device. Johnny Sexton come off the bench for the home side, with the Ireland fly-half slotting in at centre outside Madigan. The combination almost produced a decisive try as Sexton loped away to the line, only to be denied by a crossing call confirmed by video replays. But Madigan added his fourth penalty to give Leinster a four-point cushion, although Scarlets at least had the consolation of a losing bonus point despite being dominated in the second half. Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac told BBC Radio Wales: \"I'm very disappointed, I thought the boys played very well. I'm disappointed the breakdown was refereed one way, I thought. \"The stream of penalties against us [made the difference], I thought we got into some really good positions over the ball and every other week we're getting penalties for that. \"From where I was sitting, we got into some great positions for turnovers and didn't get the rewards... It should have been seven wins. \"I don't think it takes anything out [of the season's momentum], the boys know they can compete with these sides now away from home. \"That was the pleasing side of it, that we had an opportunity to win the game at the end but we probably blew it really.

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) led the international investigation. Security sources have told the BBC that the NCSC believes that a hacking group known as Lazarus launched the attack. The US Computer Emergency Response Team has also warned about Lazarus. The same group is believed to have targeted Sony Pictures in 2014. The Sony hack came as the company planned to release the movie The Interview, a satire about the North Korean leadership starring Seth Rogen. The movie was eventually given a limited release after an initial delay. The same group is also thought to have been behind the theft of money from banks. In May, ransomware called WannaCry swept across the world, locking computers and demanding payment for them to be unlocked. The NHS in the UK was particularly badly hit. Officials in Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) began their own investigation and concluded their assessment in recent weeks. The ransomware did not target Britain or the NHS specifically, and may well have been a money-making scheme that got out of control, particularly since the hackers do not appear to have retrieved any of the ransom money as yet. Although the group is based in North Korea the exact role of the leadership in Pyongyang in ordering the attack is less clear. Private sector cyber-security researchers around the world began picking apart the code to try to understand who was behind the attack soon after. Adrian Nish, who leads the cyber threat intelligence team at BAE Systems, saw overlaps with previous code developed by the Lazarus group. \"It seems to tie back to the same code-base and the same authors,\" Nish says. \"The code-overlaps are significant.\" Private sector cyber security researchers reverse engineered the code but the British assessment by the NCSC - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - is likely to have been made based on a wider set of sources. America's NSA has also more recently made the link to North Korea but its assessment is not thought to have been based on as deep as an investigation as the UK, partly because the US was not hit as hard by the incident. Officials say they have not seen any significant evidence supporting other possible culprits. North Korean hackers have been linked to money-making attacks in the past - such as the theft of $81m from the central bank of Bangladesh in 2016. This sophisticated attack involved making transfers through the Swift payment system which, in some cases, were then laundered through casinos in the Philippines. \"It was one of the biggest bank heists of all time in physical space or in cyberspace,\" says Nish, who says further activity has been seen in banks in Poland and Mexico. The Lazarus group has also been linked to the use of ransomware - including against a South Korean supermarket chain. Other analysts say they saw signs of North Korea investigating the bitcoin method of payment in recent months. The May 2017 attack was indiscriminate rather than targeted. Its spread was global and may have only been slowed thanks to the work of a British researcher who was able to find a \"kill switch\" to slow it down. The attacks caused huge disruption in the short term but they may have also been a strategic failure for the group behind it. Researchers at Elliptic, a UK-based company which tracks bitcoin payments, say they have seen no withdrawals out of the wallets into which money was paid, although people are still paying in to them. Those behind the attack may not have expected it to have spread as fast as it did. Once they realised that their behaviour was drawing global attention, the risks of moving the money may have been seen as too high given the relatively small amount involved, leaving them with little to show for their work. The revelation of the link to North Korea will raise difficult questions about what can be done to respond or deter such behaviour in the future.",

    "document": "Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show 3.7 million workers travel for two hours or longer every weekday. Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress, which published the figures, called on employers to do more to prevent \"excessive\" journeys. The average daily commute lasted 57.1 minutes in 2015, the ONS data showed. Ms O'Grady blamed stagnant wages for bulging commuting times, paired with high house prices and rental costs. \"Employers cannot turn a blind eye to this problem,\" she said. \"Long commutes eat into our family time and can be bad for our working lives too.\" Back in 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more, compared with 3.7 million today, according to the ONS's Labour Force Survey. The survey, which is based on responses from nearly 90,000 workers and excludes those who work from home, found that:. The TUC said workers were now less likely to be able to afford to live near their places of work. The cost of renting a home in the UK rose faster than the cost of living in the year to September, according to ONS figures. Meanwhile, UK property prices saw an 8.4% annual increase up to August. Longer periods travelling to and from work have therefore become an accepted part of many people's daily routine. \"It makes life difficult but it's become the norm,\" said Nick Seymour, a solicitor from Exeter, who spends at least three hours a day travelling by car and train to and from Bristol. Once a week, he also travels to his firm's office in Cardiff - a four-hour-plus round-trip. \"I've been doing this for months and am surprised how many people do the same route,\" he said. Mr Seymour, 43, said the Â£5,000 cost of train tickets, not including petrol and parking, was worth it to avoid the upheaval of relocating. \"I am considering moving, but my wife and son are based here in Exeter,\" he said. The compromise is missing out on eight-year-old son Harry's parents' evenings and school plays - not to mention delays and crowded trains. \"It can be a daily nightmare,\" he said. \"I normally stand because it's too busy, which is frustrating if you've had a long day.\" Other commuters are going to great lengths to avoid overcrowded or delayed trains. Phil Cresswell, who works in media advertising, cycles 230 miles a week on his daily journey from Leatherhead in Surrey to central London. He says spending his \"14th winter\" on the bicycle is worth it to save \"several thousands of pounds a year\" on train tickets as well as the cost of a gym membership. \"I live on the edge of the Surrey hills and it's great for cycling,\" he said. Mr Cresswell, 51, admits that some people think the 46-mile round trip is extreme. \"But I think sitting on trains or buses for similar times going nowhere is extreme,\" he said. Another unconventional commuter is Sam Cookney, who recently packed in his own five-and-a-half-hour round trip between Barcelona and London. In a blog post in 2013, he explained that flying from Barcelona for four days a week was cheaper than renting a flat in the capital. Mr Cookney, 33, moved to Barcelona last year but decided making the trip four times a week would be \"excessive\", and instead travelled to London a few times a month. \"Sadly I'm no longer commuting and living back in London,\" he said.",

    "document": "The Premier League hosts huffed and puffed before Divock Origi stole behind the Leeds defence to sweep in Trent Alexander-Arnold's right-wing cross from close range. They secured a place in the last four when Wales Under-19 international Woodburn, aged 17 years and 45 days, fired in the second to beat Owen's record by 98 days. Liverpool hit a post through Georginio Wijnaldum shortly before the opener, but the scoreline was somewhat harsh on the Yorkshire side. Leeds winger Kemar Roofe curled against the inside of a post shortly after half-time. Hadi Sacko spurned a good opportunity for the visitors in the opening 10 minutes, and Kyle Bartley nodded a free header wide after the break. Liverpool will find out who they play in the semi-finals when the draw is made after Wednesday's matches. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp might have claimed his team has \"unfinished business\" in the EFL Cup, but this competition is clearly not the German's priority this season as the Reds chase the Premier League title and a Champions League return. And that has been clear by his team selections. Klopp, like he did in the earlier rounds, rotated his team by bringing in fringe players and a handful of youngsters, though that was forced in part by the absence of Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana through injury. Without that attacking threat, the home side lacked fluency and potency in the final third until they clicked in the final 15 minutes to reach a record 17th League Cup semi-final. However, a laboured night was capped when Woodburn - on as a second-half substitute having made his debut on Saturday against Sunderland - beat Owen's record by 98 days. It was a special moment for the youngster in front of the Kop and former England striker Owen, who was watching from the main stand. Every one of Woodburn's outfield team-mates came to celebrate the historic moment as Anfield saluted their latest star. Matches between these two clubs may be rare in the modern era - but this is a fixture steeped in history. A rivalry born in the days of Bill Shankly and Don Revie, resurrected in the eras of Kenny Dalglish and Howard Wilkinson, consigned to longer memories post-Gerard Houllier and David O'Leary. And it attracted the imagination of both sets of fans, Leeds bringing almost 5,500 to a capacity crowd of 53,000. While this tie did not have the allure of a title-swinging league match or Wembley cup final of previous eras, it did provide an opportunity for Leeds to test themselves again at the highest level. Following a turbulent few seasons under Italian owner Massimo Cellino, there is a cautious optimism among Whites fans that their club may - finally - push for promotion back to the Premier League this season. Manager Garry Monk has provided a calm guidance rarely seen - or allowed - under Cellino's control, moving the club up to fifth in the Championship after four wins in their past five matches. The odds were stacked heavily in favour of the home side prior to kick-off, but the visitors created several decent opportunities against a casual Reds defence. Ultimately, they lost with a fight. But the reception given by the away fans to their players at the final whistle suggests they are optimistic a 13-year absence from the Premier League may be coming to an end in the near future. Leeds United manager Garry Monk:. \"I asked them to play in slightly different way to what we have been doing tactically, which we had to do against a very good side. \"We followed it to a tee. It just lacked us taking one of quite a few opportunities. We had the best chances of the game. \"It needed a bit more composure, that's the only negative. Better decision-making in the final third and we would have had a couple of goals. Overall I was gutted for the players. \"As a performance for a young, inexperienced team these type of nights set a marker for you. We're growing. We are disappointed but they will look back in time and think we have put on a good performance. \"I'm not going to criticise my team - they were excellent.\" Back to a Premier League title push for Liverpool.

Next year, when the government brings in a compulsory National Living Wage across the United Kingdom, there will be no separate rate for London. The living wage is calculated according to the basic cost of living. The capital's voluntary living wage - which is not legally enforceable - is assessed by the Living Wage Foundation and economists at the Greater London Authority. Mayor Boris Johnson's office estimates 724 employers in London have now signed up. Those employers now have six months to implement the new pay level. National minimum wage: The current mandatory minimum is £6.70 per hour for people aged 21 and over, and £5.30 for those aged 18 to 20. National Living Wage: This will be mandatory from April 2016 for workers aged 25 and above. It will initially be set at £7.20 an hour and is intended to exceed £9 an hour by 2020. London living wage: A voluntary higher rate of the living wage in the capital, which will rise from £9.15 to £9.40 an hour. There are currently no plans to make this scheme mandatory. Mr Johnson said the move would help \"pay the people who work hardest on lowest incomes decently\". While he is a prominent supporter of the voluntary London living wage, he has resisted calls to make it mandatory, saying small businesses \"would struggle with wage rigidity\".

Gordon, 18, was also convicted of perverting the course of justice. Clarke and Huggins' sentences were referred to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney General under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme. Huggins, 19, had his sentence increased to 16 years, and Clarke, 18, had his sentence increased to 15 years. Gordon's sentence was not considered by the court. Speaking after the hearing, Attorney General Jeremy Wright said: \"These offenders knowingly participated in the plan to assault and injure Wa'ays Dhaye knowing full well that really serious harm or death could be caused. \"Knife crime is a real scourge of our society and it's important that prison terms for this type of crime reflect the seriousness of the offending.\" Mr Dhaye, who was born in Holland but lived in Slough for 10 years, was stabbed while walking home after spending August bank holiday at the Notting Hill Carnival.

    "document": "The legend of Emperor Yu states that he tamed the flooded Yellow River by dredging and redirecting its channels, thereby laying the foundations for the Xia dynasty and Chinese civilisation. Previously, no scientific evidence had been found for a corresponding flood. But now a Chinese-led team has placed just such an event at about 1,900BC. Writing in Science Magazine, the researchers describe a cataclysmic event in which a huge dam, dumped across the Jishi Gorge by a landslide, blocked the Yellow River for six to nine months. When the dam burst, up to 16 cubic kilometres of water inundated the lowlands downstream. The evidence for this sequence of events comes from sediments left by the dammed lake, high up the sides of Jishi Gorge, as well as deposits left kilometres downstream by the subsequent flood. Lead author Dr Wu Qinglong, from Nanjing Normal University, said he and colleagues stumbled on sediments from the ancient dam during fieldwork in 2007. \"It inspired us to connect the next possible outburst flood with the abandonment of the prehistoric Lajia site 25km downstream,\" he told journalists in a teleconference. \"But at that time we had no idea what the evidence of a catastrophic outburst flood should be.\" The Lajia site, famously home to the world's oldest noodles, is known as China's Pompeii; its cave dwellings and many cultural artefacts were buried by a major earthquake. \"In July 2008 I suddenly realised that the so-called black sand previously revealed by archaeologists at the Lajia site could be, in fact, the deposits from our outburst flood,\" Dr Wu said. \"The subsequent investigation confirmed this speculation and showed that the sediments from this outburst flood are up to 20m thick, and up to 50m higher than the Yellow River - indicating an unprecedented, devastating flood.\" He and his colleagues suggest in their paper that the very same earthquake that destroyed the Lajia dwellings probably dammed the river upstream. Less than a year later, the waters returned with a vengeance. \"The flood was about 300-500,000 cubic metres per second,\" said co-author Dr Darryl Granger, from Purdue University in the US. \"That's roughly equivalent to the largest flood ever measured on the Amazon river; it's among the largest known floods to have happened on Earth during the past 10,000 years.\" Using carbon dating - on flood deposits and even on fragments of bone from earthquake victims at Lajia - the researchers date the megaflood to 1,922BC, \"plus or minus about 28 years\", Dr Granger said. If the flood was indeed the source of the Emperor Yu legend then the founding of the Xia dynasty presumably occurred within a few decades, in about 1,900BC. This date is 200-300 years later than many previous estimations. But Emperor Yu's tale is difficult to pin down using traditional historical sources; the story survived as oral history for a millennium and its first known written record dates to around 1,000BC. On the other hand a later, circa 1,900 commencement for the Xia supports that idea that this first dynasty coincided with the transition from Stone Age to Bronze Age ways of living. Some archaeologists have already linked the Xia dynasty with the Erlitou culture, an early Bronze Age society known from digs elsewhere in the Yellow River valley. Dr David Cohen from National Taiwan University, another co-author, said the study was remarkable because of the multiple lines of evidence involved. \"We have the geological evidence of just a huge outburst flood, which is incredible in itself,\" he said. \"But then there's this coincidence of it co-occurring with the destruction of the Lajia site - which is able to give us very, very precise datesâ€¦ and then that this flood was of such a scale and corresponds in time, and along the Yellow River, with both the beginnings of Bronze Age civilisation and the legend of the great flood itself. \"It's just this amazing story. All these different approaches coming together - it is just great luck.\" Prof David Montgomery of the University of Washington is a geomorphologist with an interest in what rocks can tell us about ancient myths and legends. He was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary for the journal and discussed the findings on the BBC World Service programme Science in Action. Among the world's various flood myths, Prof Montgomery said, Emperor Yu's story is an odd one. \"It's not about surviving. His basic story is about draining the flood waters; it's about river engineering.\" The case made for the Jishi Gorge megaflood is a plausible one, he said, particularly because it describes a flood that would have broken the Yellow River's banks far downstream and re-routed its flow. Prof Montgomery said this is just the sort of event that would take decades to deal with - and a long battle with the waters is a feature of the Yu myth. \"It's very difficult to ever actually prove the origin of pre-written history events. But they've made a very interesting case, that I'm sure geologists will continue to poke at, and investigate, and argue about - because that's what we do.\" At a purely geological level, he added, the flood is a major and intriguing discovery. \"But the cultural connection - possibly explaining the origin of the Chinese flood story - is too intriguing to ignore.\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter.",

The world number two inspired Great Britain to win the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years with victory over Belgium in Ghent over the weekend. Captain Leon Smith urged the LTA to use that triumph to inspire future players, but Murray, 28, said he \"did not know where the next generation are\". \"Nothing ever gets done and I don't like wasting my time,\" he said. The Scot added he has not discussed the lack of young British players competing in Grand Slams with LTA chief executive Michael Downey. Media playback is not supported on this device. \"I don't speak to any of the people who are in a high-up position about that,\" Murray revealed. \"I haven't really spoken to them about anything. \"It's concerning not to have any juniors in the Grand Slams because that is something we were always very good at. It's not ideal.\" Downey earlier said Britain's Davis Cup win was a \"special, emotional moment\" that could drive interest in the sport. Before the final in Ghent, Murray was criticised by former Great Britain Davis Cup captain David Lloyd for not putting enough back into the game. \"I'd rather concentrate on my own stuff and when I've finished playing, I'll have a lot more time to try and help or give back to the game,\" Murray added. \"Just now, I've just got to concentrate on trying to win as much as possible.\" Murray said one of his main frustrations was a lack of players to practise with whenever he is in the UK. After returning from the Shanghai Masters in October, Murray said he arrived at the National Training Centre in London to find no other players present. \"I was there on a Monday at about 3pm and then on Tuesday, at the same time,\" he said. \"There was not one person using any of the indoor courts and not one person in the gym. I took photos of it because the place cost like £40m and there are no people.\" Prior to Murray's comments, Smith said the LTA needed to quickly create a long-term strategy to capitalise on his team's victory. Smith also praised Judy Murray's tennis programmes but said the mother of British number one Andy and doubles specialist Jamie \"needs a lot of help\". \"She can't keep doing it on her own,\" he added. Media playback is not supported on this device. Murray leads the LTA's Miss-Hits programme - an introductory course for girls aged between five and eight - and a Scottish-based scheme, Tennis on the Road. Smith, who became Davis Cup captain five years ago with the team a play-off away from relegation to the event's lowest tier, added: \"At the end of the day, we all care about British tennis a lot. \"What we want to see is more people playing, so there should be a bigger talent pool in years to come. \"It really is an important time to get strategies rolled out as quickly as possible, not only to get people on the court but to keep them on the court.  We need to offer them good clubs and good coaches that turn up in all weather and bang out great sessions. Let's hope it has a positive influence, because it should do.\" The LTA was criticised for failing to capitalise on Murray's Wimbledon victory in 2013 with participation levels falling in the aftermath.

    "document": "As defence correspondent of the Daily Express he beat his rivals to a string of scoops. One of his great strengths was the ability to remember minute details without having to make a single note. After his retirement he published a series of books alleging Britain's security services had been penetrated by spies at the top level. Harry Chapman Pincher, son of an Army officer, was born in India on 29 March 1914. He went to Darlington Grammar School and London University, and graduated  in zoology and botany. Ironically while at university, some fellow students tried to sign him up to the Soviet cause. \"I said to one: 'In the event of a successful revolution, how would the new England be governed?' \"He said: 'To start with it would be governed from Moscow.' \"So I said: 'Well, bugger that.'\" Pincher worked as a teacher before joining the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943. After the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor. One of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme. He wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it. \"I'm up for use any time,\" he said. \"If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!\" But it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle. His investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things. His favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster. Only after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.) \"MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it,\" he said. \"All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know. \"'It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy.\" Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside. In the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse. Lord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting. \"He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his.\" In 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's Â£5 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences. This was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than Â£4 million to the Treasury. In 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies. This prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability. After his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy. There was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying. In the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole. Not everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor. Rupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. \"Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service. \"Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963. \"Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole.\" One of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication. Margaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher. In May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked \"secret\", to his minister of defence. \"I do not understand,\" he wrote, \"how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher? \"I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters.\" And the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967. What became known as \"the D notice affair\" began with a \"walk-in\", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop. The information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ. Before publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee. The D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published. Lohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop. Wilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express. In his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations. He said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed. \"I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay,\" he said. \"When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.\"",

    "document": "Police say they broke up the crowd of about 150 in the suburb of Ferguson after being called to the scene of a disturbance after the curfew started. A police car reportedly came under fire and a person was hurt in an apparently unrelated shooting in the same area. Black teenager Michael Brown was shot by a white policeman on 9 August. The shooting of the 18-year-old as he walked down a street drew allegations of police brutality among people in the mainly black suburb of Ferguson. A riot erupted on Friday night, with local stores targeted by looters, after police named the officer who shot Mr Brown and also released CCTV from a shop where he apparently stole a pack of cigars and intimidated the owner just before his death. A five-hour curfew, running from midnight (05:00 GMT), was imposed in response. US civil rights leader Al Sharpton has said a peaceful rally, led by Michael Brown's family, is planned for later on Sunday. The teenager's killing caused dismay across the US, with peaceful nationwide vigils held on Thursday night, while images of riot police deployed in an American city suburb have made headlines worldwide. Seven arrests were made when police moved to break up the protest at a barbecue restaurant. Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who was put in charge of bringing calm back to Ferguson, said police had moved in after receiving a report of people breaking into the restaurant and climbing on to the roof. As police were nearing the restaurant, a man with a handgun went into the street but ran away, AP news agency reports. Someone also shot at a police car but it was not clear if it had been hit. In the same area, a person was shot and critically wounded and police were searching for the attacker. Demonstrators complained that the curfew would make matters worse. As police prepared to move on the protesters during the night, a chant of \"No justice! No curfew!\" could be heard from the crowd, followed by \"We have the right to assemble peacefully\". Jayson Ross, who was leading the protesters toward the police before tear gas was fired, was quoted as saying by AP: \"They got guns. We got guns. We are ready.\" Local politician Antonio French, who was with the protesters, tweeted to say: \"Too many young men talking about they're ready to die tonight.\" Governor Jay Nixon said he would not allow a handful of looters to endanger the community. \"This is a test,\" he said. \"The eyes of the world are watching. We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.\" The US justice department is investigating the shooting of Mr Brown, with 40 FBI agents dispatched to Ferguson to gather information. Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson revealed on Friday that the officer who shot Mr Brown was Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran with no previous complaints against him. Mr Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Commenting on the CCTV footage that was released, Chief Jackson said that Mr Wilson had not known Mr Brown was a robbery suspect. The policeman had reportedly stopped the teenager for walking in the street, disrupting traffic. Mr Brown's family condemned the release of the footage as a police attempt to \"justify the execution-style murder\".",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. She plays a no-nonsense character in House of Cards, and in real life Robin Wright is no different. For four seasons, viewers have seen her in the role of Claire Underwood, the Machiavellian partner of stop-at-nothing politician, Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey. Both actors have also directed and produced episodes of the show. But while their roles are equally prominent, for years their salaries were not in parity. \"I was like, 'I want to be paid the same as Kevin.' It was a perfect paradigm and example to use, because there are very few films or TV shows where the male—the patriarch and the matriarch are equal. And they are in House of Cards,\" she told an audience at New York's Rockefeller Foundation. Wright looked at statistics which showed that for some time, her character was more popular than Spacey's. \"So I capitalised on it. I was like, 'You better pay me or I'm going to go public…and they did.'\" Wright's success at equalising her pay is a story to be noted, because it is still incredibly rare. \"She is playing a popular and important character in a series. She has leverage and she used it,\" says Lisa Maatz, vice president for government relations at the American Association of University Women (AAUW), which has conducted research into the broader issue. \"I admire her for standing up to them. Not everybody is going to be as fortunate. But her situation in terms of being underpaid is far too common.\" US government statistics show that on average, women are paid less than their male counterparts, 79 cents for every dollar a man earns. According to the White House, the median wage of a woman working full-time all year in America is about $39,600 (£27,116), 79% of a man's median earnings, which stand at $50,400. The statistic is widely used to illustrate the discrepancy in pay across the sexes, and looks across all sectors. In Fresno, California, Aileen Rizo took a similar stand against her employer after she learned she was receiving less pay than a new male employee, who didn't have a masters degree like she did. Ms Rizo had been working as a maths consultant for four years for Fresno County Office of Education, when she found out that the new hire was being paid at the highest salary scale (a nine), while she was being paid at the lowest (a one). When she confronted her human resources department about the difference, she was told it wasn't a mistake. \"They said they'd used my prior pay as a guide, and that's why I was on less,\" she explained. Ms Rizo began legal action against her employers in 2013, who argued they set wages based on the employee's most recent salary, plus a five percent increase. Experience wasn't a determining factor, they said. Representatives for Fresno County pointed out that a woman working in the same department as Ms Rizo, was being paid more, and said that in the past 25 years more women had been on higher salary scales, than men in the same or similar position in the department. The court ruled in Ms Rizo's favour, arguing that the fact another woman earned more than her, shouldn't diminish her right to a fair wage.  Her employers appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing. Since she began her lawsuit, Ms Rizo is now receiving the same pay as her male colleague, but she continues to fight for backdated wages. She also testified before the California legislature, which has since passed an Equal Pay Act in the state. While she believes employers need to be more transparent and fair, she does also think women could also do more. \"We do need to get better at negotiating. I was trusting an organisation to act in a way of integrity. I took for granted that that's where everyone started.\" \"Whether you have to file a lawsuit or demand it and get it, women need to empower others and educate society about a problem that's still evident,\" she says. But the scale of the problem is something which is widely debated. Some critics say the \"79 cents for every dollar\" statistic is misleading, because it doesn't compare two people working in the same job, with the same background and qualifications. When those factors are taken into account, there still is a gender pay gap, but the percentage difference is much smaller, at around 7%. \"The idea that when a young woman graduates, the idea she's going to get paid 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, working in the same job, across our economy is a myth,\" argues Karin Agness, who is president of the Network of Enlightened Women, a conservative policy group. Ms Agness believes that the 79 cents statistic gives young graduates a false impression of the workplace they're about to enter. \"It creates a victim mentality in women, and we don't want our young women going into the workforce thinking they are victims just because they are women,\" she says. But Lisa Maatz from the AAUW says both measures are valid - one is more general, the other specifically compares similar roles - but both point to a discrepancy which needs to be addressed. \"The gender wage gap has many causes and contributors, including differences in education, experience, occupation and industry, and family responsibilities. But even after accounting for these factors, a gap still remains between men's earnings and women's earnings,\" argues a White House report on the issue. Data on the pay gap for Hispanic and black women shows greater disparities. The gap between similar jobs fluctuates wildly based on the sector. And even controlling for similar jobs, the gap grows for women who are promoted into the director and executive level. For Ms Maatz, there are other areas which also need to be addressed when it comes to wage disparity, for example the rise of so-called \"pink collar\" jobs, in which certain roles such as nurses, secretaries and teachers, are devalued simply because more women do them. But Robin Wright's experience is a reminder that the gender pay gap affects women across all professions. She hopes her example will encourage other women to speak up. \"It's a male dominant workplace society. It always has been. And that's just the history. \"But it has to be unacceptable at this stage.\" Follow Rajini Vaidyanathan on Twitter - @BBCRajiniv.",

One of the few women to receive a mention is Marie Curie, a physicist and chemist who basically discovered radiation and helped apply it in the field of X-rays. She won two Nobel Prizes, in physics and chemistry. Yet even so, she was turned down for membership of the prestigious French Academie des Sciences in 1911, the very year she went on to win her second Nobel Prize. The Nobel laureate Sir Tim Hunt was heavily criticised for his disparaging remarks about women in science last week, which for some raised the issue of where women stood in the scientific community. The larger truth is that women have made big and important discoveries in science - think of Dorothy Hodgkin, the brilliant crystallographer who mapped the structure of penicillin and went on to be awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964. Hodgkin was the first woman to win the prestigious Copley Medal, and she remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in the sciences. Yet at the time, the newspapers carried headlines such as \"Oxford housewife wins Nobel\". But many female scientists in the past were not given the credit they deserved for their achievements. As a result, their names have all but disappeared from public consciousness. Here are just a few. Esther Lederberg, a microbiologist, conducted groundbreaking research in the field of genetics. She developed basic techniques that have gone a long way towards helping scientists understand how genes work. Her work helped her husband, Joshua, win a Nobel prize in 1958, but she was not cited in the award. The British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering X-ray crystallographer. Her image of the DNA molecule was critical to deciphering its structure - one of the biggest and most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century - but it was James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins who received the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work. Ida Tacke made huge advances in both chemistry and atomic physics. It was she who managed to find two new elements, rhenium and masurium, that Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted would form part of the periodic table. She gets credit in the science books for the discovery of rhenium. But masurium is now known as technetium, the discovery of which is attributed to Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre. Tacke's evidence was ignored until Perrier and Segre artificially created the element in a laboratory. Tacke is also credited with being the first person to open up the idea of nuclear fission. Lise Meitner's work in nuclear physics led to the discovery of nuclear fission - where atomic nuclei split in two. This laid the groundwork for the atomic bomb. After moving to Berlin in 1907, Meitner collaborated with chemist Otto Hahn over many decades. But Hahn published their findings without including Meitner as a co-author. And he went on to win the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to splitting the atom. Chien-Shiung Wu was one of the most important physicists of the 20th Century. She participated in the development of the atom bomb, as part of the Manhattan Project. Yet few know her name today. In the 1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, asked Wu to help disprove what is known in physics as the law of parity.  Wu's experiments turned this law on its head. This landmark moment in physics led to a 1957 Nobel Prize for Yang and Lee, but not for Wu, who was left out despite the key role she played. Another neglected pioneer is the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt, who helped change the way we see the universe. She began her work by measuring and recording stars at the Harvard Observatory - one of the few jobs in science that was considered suitable for women. Leavitt spotted a pattern between the brightness of a star and its distance from the Earth. This led her to uncover what is known as the period-luminosity relationship, allowing scientists to calculate how far away a star was from Earth based on its brightness. The Royal Society - swift in its condemnation of Sir Tim's remarks - was founded in 1660 and has yet to elect a female president. It represents the scientific establishment in the UK, and its early members included Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Women were not permitted to become fellows until 1945, almost 300 years after its foundation. Some say that the comments from Sir Tim - a prominent fellow of the society - will damage the efforts it is making to improve diversity. It has been reported that only 6% of its fellows - a prestigious title in the world of science - are women. That statistic, some say, sums up the scale of the wider problem of the difficulties faced by women in the scientific world.",

Young visitors from Israel often travel to areas like Goa to relax after completing their compulsory military service. In a unusual move, the warning was published on Friday evening in Israel, after the start of the Jewish Sabbath when government offices close for business.

Israel's warning came hours after Australian anti-terror police charged a man for making threats against Sydney's New Year's Eve celebrations.

    "document": "The fratricide within the Republican Party is getting much of the national attention, but the two remaining Democratic candidates - and their supporters - are starting to swing some sharp elbows. The Wisconsin primary on Tuesday marks the beginning of the Democratic presidential campaign's endgame. More than half the pledged delegates have already been apportioned, and only a few truly landscape-altering battlegrounds - New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California - remain on the calendar. Mr Sanders can claim momentum, with wins in five of the last six contests, but he needs a sizeable victory in Wisconsin if he wants to properly set the stage for the critical coming contests and cut into Mrs Clinton's 263 delegate lead. It's enough to set both candidates on edge. On Thursday, when confronted by a Greenpeace activist in New York about whether she could address climate change while taking donations from the fossil fuel industry, Mrs Clinton showed a rare flash of anger. \"I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me,\" she said. Her campaign would later assert that the former secretary of state, like Mr Sanders, takes donations from individuals employed in the energy sector but is prohibited from accepting money from corporations. It was a moment of emotion for a usually carefully controlled candidate - and the Sanders camp quickly responded. \"If the Clinton campaign wants to argue that industry lobbyists giving thousands of dollars to her campaign won't affect her decisions if she's elected, that's fine,\" Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver said. \"But to call us liars for pointing out basic facts about the secretary's fundraising is deeply cynical and very disappointing.\" It was just one of numerous recent shots between the two campaigns. When Mrs Clinton unveiled manufacturing proposals on Friday, a Sanders spokesperson said the former secretary of state has embraced \"policies that have decimated the manufacturing industry ... and eliminated millions of jobs across the country\". Trump's disastrous women voter problem - This voting bloc could doom in chances in the general election. #BernieMadeMeWhite: Minority supporters of Sanders speak out - Supporters push back against \"all-white\" narrative. Trump, Clinton and the 'None of the Above' era - Rarely have those running for high office been held in such low esteem. Full US election coverage from the BBC. At a campaign event, Mr Sanders offered criticisms of Mrs Clinton's six-figure speeches to Wall Street firms, her foreign policy views and her position on environmental issues, as his supporters heartily booed. On Saturday Mrs Clinton noted that she has been a \"proud Democrat my adult life\" - drawing a contrast with Mr Sanders, who is a self identified \"democratic socialist\" who serves in Congress as an independent. \"I think that is kind of important if we are selecting someone to be the Democratic nominee of the Democratic Party,\" Mrs Clinton said. \"I think the secretary is getting very nervous,\" Mr Sanders countered on Sunday, noting that polls show him doing better than Mrs Clinton against Republican front-runner Donald Trump. \"I think we've got a lot of young people's vote, working-class people's vote,\" Mr Sanders said. \"I think we're on the way to a victory if we can win the Democratic nomination.\" This tension in the Democrat race is a relatively recent development. Last autumn, Mr Sanders famously said during the first debate that he was \"sick and tired\" of talking about Mrs Clinton's email server imbroglio - passing on a chance to target what could have been a key weakness in his main opponent. When Mr Sanders entered the race, he said he wasn't interested in running a negative political campaign. It was a strategic decision that has led to some recent second-guessing among advisers within the candidate's campaign, as witnessed by a surprisingly pessimistic story in the New York Times on Monday. \"The central complication with Bernie is that he never wanted to cross into the zone of personal attacks because it would undercut his brand,\" Sanders adviser Tad Devine told the Times. That hasn't stopped acrimony from flaring among the two candidates' supporters, however - even in typically restrained states like Wisconsin. Lisa Stubek, a state representative who endorsed Mrs Clinton early in the campaign, says she's caught fire from pro-Sanders constituents in the ultra-liberal state capital of Madison. \"Bernie Sanders supporters are pretty relentless, unfortunately, as far as their support and as far as attacking those who support anyone but their candidate,\" she said. \"And that's not true of everyone, but certainly there is a core group of Bernie Sanders supporters here in Madison who do that.\" While Ms Stubek says that the campaign has largely been above-the-board, things have taken a turn for the worse. \"I think certainly when you have Bernie Sanders out there stretching the truth or out-and-out lying, things do heat up,\" she said. \"I'm glad that Hillary is out there defending her record. More than anything people in our state want the facts.\" Another Madison-area Democratic representative, Melissa Sargent, says she decided not to endorse a presidential candidate in part because the noise between the two candidates would drown out her efforts to address other issues and local campaigns. \"When I go to doors and I'm stumping for my local candidates, I can talk about the things that I want to talk about and I can hear authentically what folks are saying,\" she said. \"It felt like I wouldn't be able to navigate the path that I am with these other races.\" Democrats in Wisconsin are quick to note that their challenges are nothing compared to what the Republicans are facing, as their two leading candidates engage in harsh negative attacks and exchange barbs over their wives and marital infidelity. Brett Hulsey, a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders, called the Republican campaign a \"food fight circus\". \"Democrats are still fighting by the Queensberry Rules,\" he said, drawing a boxing analogy. He cautions that while tempers seem to be flaring among Democrats at this point, things will eventually calm down. If Mrs Clinton wins, he plans to support her - and he predicts most Sanders backers will follow suit. \"We're in the middle of the fray right now,\" he said. \"I remind everybody to take a few deep breaths and remain calm. I've worked every presidential since 1980 for Jimmy Carter. I've seen this movie before.\" At a rally in Madison on Sunday night it seemed an era of good feelings may have returned. Mr Sanders spoke to a crowd of 4,200 for more than an hour and made no mention of his Democratic opponent. Instead, he focused his criticism on Mr Trump and Republican Governor (and former candidate) Scott Walker. He also seemed to be broadening his perspective. \"This campaign is about more than just electing a president of the United States, although I would very much appreciate your support,\" he said. \"It's about creating a political revolution.\" After the event, Jess A Weber - who had travelled to Madison from Illinois to volunteer for the Sanders campaign - said she appreciated that Mr Sanders has tried to run a positive campaign. \"He continues to pull focus back to the message and back to our strength in unifying, coming together instead of dividing and bringing anyone down,\" she said. On the campaign trail in Janesville on Monday, however, Mr Sanders was back to swiping at his opponent for her past positions on international trade and commerce. \"I have voted against and led the opposition to every one of these disastrous trade agreements,\" Mr Sanders said. \"Secretary Clinton has supported virtually every one.\" The Democratic race is far from a bare-knuckle fight, but the candidates aren't done trying to draw blood.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Police reported 1,362 criminal incidents across Canada motivated by hate, a 5% increase from the previous year. The findings were published on Tuesday by Statistics Canada. The annual report by the federal statistics agency was compiled using police data from across the country. Nearly half of all incidents were linked to race or ethnicity, with black Canadians the most common target. Just over a third of reported hate crimes were motivated by hatred of a religion. Canada's Jewish population remained the most targeted religious group, accounting for 13% of all incidents, despite a decline in the overall number of reported crimes. Shimon Koffler Fogel, with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, called the data \"disturbing and clear\". He also said in the statement that the Jewish community stood with other targeted groups in condemning hatred in all its forms. \"An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,\" he said. Muslims reported being more frequently targeted in 2015, with 159 incidents reported compared with 99 in 2014, accounting for 12% of all incidents. However, Statistics Canada notes many police services have reached out to ethnic communities and there have been efforts by groups like the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) to encourage reporting. Incidents targeting Catholics also increased, jumping from 35 to 55 individual incidents. Almost 40% of all reported hate crimes were considered violent incidents, which could include assault and uttering threats. Members of the LGBT community reported slightly fewer hate crimes in 2015 but were more likely to be the victims of hate-related violence. In a news conference following the report's release, the NCCM's legal counsel, Khalid Elgazzar, pointed to the murder of six men in a Quebec City mosque this January as \"a painful reminder of how hate can destroy lives and deeply shake communities\". The NCCM was joined by other groups in calling for more funding and resources for police forces to fight hate crimes and improve reporting. The Statistics Canada report notes that the figures do not paint a full picture of the true extent of hate crime in Canada. They suggest that only about 35% of hate crimes are actually reported to police.",

He was meant to be released last week as part of a deal agreed with President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to end a violent stand-off in the capital, Sanaa. Mr Hadi and his government have since offered their resignations, saying they could not continue in their posts under such pressure from the rebels. Their decision came after the Houthis seized the presidential palace complex and shelled the president's private home. In a televised speech following the release of Mr Hadi's chief of staff, rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi dismissed the president's resignation as a \"manoeuvre\". He said Yemeni political parties, with UN support, had been holding consultations. \"We are seeking a peaceful transfer of power on the basis of partnership,\" he was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. The resolutions of the National Dialogue Conference (NDC), held after an uprising forced longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh from power, and the peace deal signed by Mr Hadi after the rebels overran Sanaa in September, would be the basis for any agreement, he added. \"Let everyone go towards co-operation instead of clashing, arguing and wrestling.\" A week ago, Mr Houthi accused the president and those around him of failing to implement political deals which he said should have ushered in a new era in Yemen. He listed as his main demand the shake-up of the commission tasked with writing a review of a new constitution to ensure more representation for his group. The rebels have rejected a draft of the charter that would create a federal state of six regions, even though the plan was a recommendation of the NDC, which they backed. They seized Mr Bin Mubarak on 17 January to stop him attending a meeting to discuss the draft, saying they had become aware of \"irregularities\" in the text.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Writing in Lancet Global Health, they predict cases will rise from 36 million to 115 million by 2050, if treatment is not improved by better funding. A growing ageing population is behind the rising numbers. Some of the highest rates of blindness and vision impairment are in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of the world's population with visual impairments is actually falling, according to the study. But because the global population is growing and more people are living well into old age, researchers predict the number of people with sight problems will soar in the coming decades. Analysis of data from 188 countries suggests there are more than 200 million people with moderate to severe vision impairment. That figure is expected to rise to more than 550 million by 2050. \"Even mild visual impairment can significantly impact a person's life,\" said lead author Prof Rupert Bourne, from Anglia Ruskin University. \"For example, reducing their independence... as it often means people are barred from driving.\" He said it also limited people's educational and economic opportunities. The worst affected areas for visual impairment are in South and East Asia. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa also have particularly high rates. The study calls for better investment in treatments, such as cataract surgery, and ensuring people have access to appropriate vision-correcting glasses. Prof Rupert Bourne said: \"Interventions provide some of the largest returns on investment. \"They are some of the most easily implemented interventions in developing regions.\" \"They are cheap, require little infrastructure and countries recover their costs as people enter back into the workforce,\" he said. The charity Sightsavers, which works in more than thirty countries to try to eliminate avoidable blindness, says it is seeing a rise in conditions such as cataracts, where the eye's lens clouds over. \"Due to an ageing population and a rise in chronic disease, we expect the burden of blindness to only grow within the world's poorest countries\" said Imran Khan from the charity. He said health systems in developing countries need to be improved, and more surgeons and nurses need to be trained to deliver sustainable eye health care.",

Horan will take over from current president Aogan O Fearghail in 2018. \"Aogan is the president for the next 12 months so I'll support him and learn from him as best I can,\" said Horan at Croke Park. The other candidates for the post were Martin Skelly with 22 votes while 20 went to Robert Frost. This weekend's annual congress will be dominated by new championship proposals in football and hurling. The plans put forward by GAA director general Paraic Duffy include completing the All-Ireland Senior Championships by the end of August. Also included is a new round-robin format for the All-Ireland SFC quarter-finals, which would mean more games. This proposal has proved particularly controversial in recent weeks. Both the Gaelic Players' Association and recently formed Club Players' Association have come out against Duffy's plans, although not necessarily for the same reasons. Ostensibly, the main reason for these mooted changes is to try and ensure more regular games for club players but there is a certain  amount of bafflement as to how this can be squared with the motion to have a round-robin stage in the All-Ireland Football quarter-finals. The new club players' body has been angered after the GAA's top brass refused to grant it a speaking platform at the Croke Park gathering. However, that may change at further annual gatherings of GAA delegates if a motion for the club players' body to be officially recognised is passed in Dublin. All the indications are that the votes on both the so-called new 'Super Eight football round' and the proposal to bring forward the All-Ireland finals will be exceptionally close, with a two-thirds' majority required for the format changes to be tried for a three-year period. To make matters even complicated, congress will also hear a number of motions calls from the two-thirds majority to be scrapped, with one call suggestion a simple majority and another calling for the figure to be lowered to 60%. Inevitably, those motions will require a two-thirds majority to be passed. Going into the weekend, Croke Park's desire for replays to be scrapped - in favour of extra-time - in all championship games bar provincial and All-Ireland finals looks likely to be comfortably passed. At last year's congress, motions to move All-Ireland Finals to earlier in the year and scrap replays were both defeated, although the finals proposal fell narrowly short after getting support from 60.8% of delegates.",

Andrew Herman, an attorney who has advised lawmakers on ethics issues, said: \"I think the right way to do that is to make her a special government employee. \"But that implicates all kind of formal and disclosure issues.\" The political influence of the US first daughter and her husband has raised questions about possible conflicts of interests. Federal anti-nepotism laws bar relatives of the president from being appointed to government positions. But an exception was made for Mr Kushner after the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel cited the president's \"special hiring authority\". Since the election Ms Trump has placed her fashion company's interests in a trust, handing off day-to-day operations to her top executive. Her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Josh Kushner and Nicole Meyer, have been named trustees, reports the New York Times. However, several retailers have dropped her products, saying that sales of her brand were falling. Ms Trump is also being sued by a fashion company in San Francisco that says she is cashing in on her position as first daughter. Modern Appealing Clothing said in court documents filed last week that Ms Trump's firm has an \"unfair advantage\" in the marketplace. She has already forbidden her eponymous brand from advertising using images of her taken since the inauguration. Since Mr Trump's inauguration in January, Ms Trump has been seen attending meetings with world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, last week, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ms Trump is due to release a book - Women Who Work - in May, with the proceeds going to charity, Ms Gorelick said.",

Archibald, who is on the four-man shortlist for the PFA Scotland manager of the year award, said he had never seen Polish coaches at work so did not know how accurate the Jagiellonia Bialystok defender's comments were. \"I've never been there, so I don't know where he's coming from,\" said the Jags boss. \"But I think when any player goes abroad, you'll pick something up. Your eyes are opened wide, and you'll learn something a little bit different.\" Further, Archibald said the standard of coaching in Scotland was \"very good\". He continued: \"I think a lot of top coaches come here to do their coaching badges so we must be doing something right. \"As (Celtic manager) Brendan Rodgers says, you get a challenge every week. This has probably been the best season in terms of the challenge, tactically. \"All the managers are now playing different shapes and changing it during games as well, so I think all coaches are tactically very aware and they all do their homework now as well. \"I don't think any team just turns up on a Saturday and says 'right, on you go, go and play'. There's a lot of work going in during the week from every team in the league.\" Archibald admitted to being taken aback to be nominated by his peers as Scotland's top manager this season, along with Rodgers, Aberdeen's Derek McInnes and Morton's Jim Duffy. \"I think (I'm surprised) just because we've not won anything,\" said the manager, whose team reached the Premiership's top six for the first time. \"Brendan's won trophies, Derek's been to semi-finals and finals and so has Jim. \"We are sixth and sometimes from the outside people don't know how hard you work, or what it takes to get there. \"Making the top six is huge to a club like ours, and sometimes it's as good as winning a trophy.\"",

    "document": "The choice of a running mate is one of the most crucial decisions a candidate will make during a presidential run. He is looking for a number two who can balance his weaknesses, appeal to new voter constituencies, persuade independent voters to give him a second look, and campaign effectively on his behalf. All the while, Mr Romney will need a partner who will not outshine him on the stump or otherwise detract attention from him. The perfect VP pick will also need to convince voters he or she is ready to assume the presidency if anything happens to Mr Romney - to be just a heartbeat away from the Oval Office, as the American political adage goes. As Mr Romney nears a decision, here are some of the top possibilities:. Paul Ryan, 42, has made a name for himself as the top Republican on budget issues, calling for a dramatic reduction in entitlement programmes and other government spending and in taxes. The Wisconsin congressman, chairman of the House Budget committee, is seen as a persuasive surrogate with the capacity to take the Romney campaign on the offensive on issues that are likely to dominate in this election year - such as jobs, the economy and the deficit. He is also a staunch conservative from a state that both parties consider to be up for grabs in the coming election. Since becoming chairman of the House Budget committee in 2007, Mr Ryan has worked on shaping an alternative vision for the federal budget. But Mr Ryan's budget proposals are seen as so severe and conservative that they could pose a problem for Mr Romney among independent voters less keen to slash taxes and cherished social programmes. Mr Ryan studied at Ohio's Miami University and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998 at the age of 28. He is currently serving his seventh term. Rob Portman, 56, is a veteran of Washington, having served in the House of Representatives for 12 years and in White House roles under both Presidents Bush. In selecting him, Mr Romney would hope to pick up votes from the crucial battleground state of Ohio, while also having a competent veteran of Washington on the ticket. But Mr Portman's strengths are also his weaknesses. Often portrayed as dull, he brings little excitement and pizzazz to the ticket. His years in Washington would detract from Mr Romney's effort to run as a political outsider. And his role in the second Bush White House could turn off both independent voters and hard-core fiscal conservatives angered by Mr Bush's expansion of government spending and his widening of the federal budget deficit. Mr Portman was born in Cincinnati and educated at Dartmouth College and the University of Michigan law school. Later, he worked in legal roles in George Bush Sr's White House. He served in the US House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, when George Bush Jr appointed him US Trade Representative. In 2006, Mr Bush appointed him director of the Office of Management and Budget, a role in which he helped formulate White House budget and tax policy. He left that job in 2007. In 2010 he was elected to the Senate, succeeding Republican George Voinovich. Tim Pawlenty, 51, is seen as a \"Sam's Club Republican\" for his supposed appeal to working and lower-middle class voters (Sam's Club is a chain of giant discount stores run by Wal-Mart). Mr Pawlenty made his own brief run for the Republican nomination, but quit the race in 2011 before a vote was counted when he failed to gain traction with voters or the media. He could help balance Mr Romney's wealthy, patrician image and certainly brings enough political experience to the table. Currently without a full-time job, he has been an effective surrogate for Mr Romney on the campaign trail, and the men get on well personally. But he is seen as lacking charisma, and he does not bring to the ticket a geographic constituency - Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, having last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 1972, and before that, in 1956. Mr Pawlenty has also broken from current Republican orthodoxy on a number of issues, including on energy and environmental policy (although he later renounced his backing for \"cap and trade\" plans), and with a call for universal health insurance for children. Mr Pawlenty grew up in a family of modest means in South St Paul, the son of a trucking company worker. He studied law at the University of Minnesota and was elected to the state House of Representatives from a suburban district in 1992. He rose in the state House, winning the role of Republican majority leader in 1999. In 2002, he was elected governor. He was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential running mate to John McCain in 2008. Marco Rubio, 41, is everything Mr Portman and Mr Pawlenty are not: He is young, handsome, energetic, and a gifted and engaging public speaker and television presence. He is a darling of the conservative populist Tea Party movement, giving him a grassroots appeal Mr Romney's other options lack. The son of Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio could conceivably dent Mr Obama's overwhelming advantage with Hispanic voters. And he could help carry the crucial state of Florida for the Republican ticket. But Mr Rubio also brings drawbacks. At 41, he is younger than Mr Obama was in 2008, and he has less experience on the national political stage than the president did when he launched his run for the White House. When Mr Rubio was young, his family briefly attended a Mormon church, which would risk alienating some evangelical Christian voters already suspicious of Mr Romney's Mormon faith. And it is unclear the extent to which Mr Rubio could win Hispanic votes from the Democrats. The majority of Hispanic Americans have a Mexican background and are unlikely to identify with a Cuban American merely because they speak the same language. Mr Rubio, a lawyer by training, was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000 and rose through the leadership to become House speaker in 2008. In 2010 he was elected to the US Senate. Bobby Jindal, 41, was the first Indian American elected governor. In choosing him, Mr Romney would hope to broaden his appeal beyond non-Hispanic white voters - or at least soften the party's image among independent voters. Mr Jindal is a die-hard social conservative and is leading the Republican governors' charge against President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. Those attributes could win Mr Romney support on the Republican right-wing. Mr Jindal is also fiercely intelligent, attending Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar. Mr Jindal's first foray into national politics fell flat - he was chosen to give the Republican rebuttal to Mr Obama's 2009 State of the Union address - and he was dismissed as not quite ready for prime-time. His national profile subsequently rose in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when he positioned himself as a bold leader in dealing with the disaster and a critic of the Obama administration's response. Before entering politics, he worked briefly for consulting firm McKinsey and Company in Washington DC. While in his mid-20s he was appointed to lead the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, and soon was running the national Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Under President George W Bush, he was assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, and became governor in 2008. John Thune, 51, has been seen as a giant-killer by fellow Republicans since he ousted the Senate's Democratic majority leader to claim his seat in the chamber in 2004. The two-term Senator has become a familiar face on US talk shows and is a prolific fundraiser within the party, using extra cash from his own coffers to bolster the campaigns of other Republican Senate candidates. Mr Thune's staunchly conservative voting record, especially on social issues, could be an asset for Mr Romney, who has struggled to convince his party's base that he is conservative enough for them. In 2010 Mr Thune toyed with the idea of running for president himself but ultimately decided not to, saying in February 2011 that he preferred to serve in the \"trenches\" of the Senate. Mr Thune is the son of a Norwegian immigrant and hails from Murdo, a small South Dakota town west of the Missouri River. He studied at Biola University in California and the University of South Dakota's business school. He served in the House of Representatives from 1997 to 2003.",

    "document": "At a rally in his hometown of Hope, Arkansas, Mr Huckabee used the phrase \"hope to higher ground\" as a motif. The bass guitar-playing, foreign policy hawk has had a media career since losing the nomination in 2008. He joins a crowded Republican field that includes three senators, a businesswoman and a neurosurgeon. \"Folks, it is a long way from a little brick rent house on Second Street in Hope, Arkansas to the White House,\" he said. \"Here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe that where a person started didn't mean that's where he had to stop. I always believed that a kid could go from Hope to higher ground.\" After announcing his ambitions, the crowd erupted in cheers of \"We want Mike!\" The former Southern Baptist minister acknowledged his pro-gun-ownership position, telling the audience about receiving a BB gun at the age of five. He said the US Department of Education should be abolished, a position popular with conservatives who oppose recent national education reforms. On immigration, he said the US borders should be secured, but was short on details. And he reaffirmed his steadfast opposition to same-sex marriage. Mike Huckabee is back. Eight years ago he launched a surprisingly successful presidential bid, finishing second to Arizona Senator John McCain and winning the Iowa caucuses and seven other states. Four years ago rumours abounded that Mr Huckabee was going to run again. Supporters and analysts watched and waited...  and waited. The former Arkansas governor, who had a well-paying job as a television and radio host, opted to sit out the campaign, despite some polls showing him leading the Republican field. He said his \"heart says no\". Now, however, Mr Huckabee's heart is saying yes. He has quit his media commitments and is diving into the 2016 race. He'll meet a much more crowded field than would have faced him in 2012, however, both in the total number of candidates and in opponents who will compete with him for the evangelical voters who buoyed his 2008 campaign. Mr Huckabee has a lot going for him - name recognition, a developed fundraising network and experience from his previous presidential campaign. But given the strength of his Republican opponents - new, engaging and also well-funded - will that be enough? Early in his speech, Mr Huckabee noted that he was the first male in his family to graduate from high school. \"My dad wasn't an educated man, but he was a smart man. And he and my mother didn't have a whole lot, but they had honesty to the bone,\" he said. As his campaign gets under way, Mr Huckabee could face challenges within his own party. Many conservatives will not like the fact that overall, taxes and spending went up during his time as Arkansas governor. In 2008, Mr Huckabee won eight primaries in socially conservative states but this time he has vowed to focus more on the economy and national security. To win the Republican crown, he will have to overcome Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, as well as former Hewlett-Packard boss Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Jeb Bush has not officially announced but is the frontrunner in the party.",

The UN says 124,000 people reached Greece's shores by sea in the first seven months of 2015. Ms Olcay said the items would be bought elsewhere if she did not sell them. Admitting that she was taking part in the trade, she alleged that local Turkish authorities were also involved.

After telling this to his audience at Perth's Southern Fried Festival, Inverness resident Judi Menabney came forward and offered to find the grave. Salvona's resting place has since been found in Tomnahurich Cemetery. Owens' research of his family tree influenced the writing of Dora, a track on his Nashville-recorded album Into the Sea. The song is about his grandmother, Dora Salvona Owens, who grew up in a circus that Salvona started in Scotland. Salvona was thought to have arrived in Scotland from Italy in the company of a dancing bear, sometime in the late 19th Century. Owens' lyrics of the song include the lines: \"Somewhere way back there's a lion tamer/Ambrose and his dancing bear/He's buried in the Highlands/but we're not sure where.\" Ms Menabney works for High Life Highland, an organisation that runs archives, registration and family history services on Highland Council's behalf.

Family historian Anne Fraser said: \"It was great fun investigating Ambrose's story. \"He turns out to have been a very colourful character - which may not be a surprise - but we have also finished up raising as many questions as we've answered.\" The staff at the centre found out that Salvona was married twice and was the father of at least 10 children. He was 80 when he first arrived in Inverness and was, at the end of his life at the age of 88, a resident of a poor house that later became Hilton Hospital and is today a block of flats. Salvona appears to been a popular figure in the Highland town. A procession of people carried his body to a prominent position at Tomnahurich following his death on 13 October 1917. The inscription on the gravestone acknowledges his career as a lion tamer. Owens said: \"I can't believe the final resting place of my great great grandfather has been found. \"I'm very grateful to Judi, Anne and their colleagues for all the work they've put into discovering his story. \"I'm delighted they want to use it and my song Dora - which started the search - in their own presentations.\" The singer added: \"You really don't know what's up there, way up in the family tree.

More on the fraud case and other stories from Devon and Cornwall. Former nurse Vasco-Knight, of Runcorn, Cheshire, shook and sobbed uncontrollably as she changed her plea to one of the two charges of fraud she faced. Recorder Don Tait adjourned sentence until March but warned the Vasco-Knights that a \"custodial sentence is a distinct possibility\". He told the jury: \"As far as Mrs Vasco-Knight is concerned, she has fallen a long way, hasn't she, but that is her responsibility.\" Vasco-Knight was CEO at the South Devon NHS Foundation Trust and the national lead for equalities for NHS England when the offence occurred. The newsletter was commissioned by her in April 2013 and produced by her husband's firm Thinking Caps that July, the court heard. But it was a \"sham\", cut and pasted from a research paper by the Kings Fund charity, said Gareth Evans, prosecuting. He said Vasco-Knight's failure to declare an interest in Thinking Caps was a criminal offence and a \"massive breach of trust and abuse of her position as chief executive\". Vasco-Knight later tried to blame Habib Naqvi, a senior manager in the NHS, for commissioning the newsletter. Mr Naqvi, 28, of Bristol, was cleared of two counts of aiding and abetting. The prosecution offered no evidence on the second fraud charge against Mrs Vasco-Knight of swindling £9,000 from the NHS. She and her husband were released on bail to 10 March for sentencing. Sue Frith, managing director of NHS Protect, which conducted the investigation, said Vasco-Knight's meteoric career path had been \"an inspiration to so many\" and her fraud was a \"huge disappointment and shock to many\".",

A spokesman said no-one had been injured although two security guards aged 47 and 49 were left badly shaken. The area around the bank, which is near the Buchanan Galleries shopping centre, has been cordoned off by police. Police said the security guards had been making their delivery when they were approached by the three armed men, who threatened them and demanded they hand over a box of money. It is understood the cash taken was in the region of Â£50,000. Following the robbery, the three men got into a white Seat Leon car, which sped off along West Nile Street towards the Cowcaddens area. The car has since been found in Scott Street, near Stow College. Police said it was being taken for forensic examination. Inquiries have so far revealed that the car performed a u-turn on West Nile Street, causing a cyclist to take evasive action to avoid a collision, immediately prior to the robbery. Officers are appealing for the cyclist to contact them. The suspects are described as wearing dark-coloured clothing and balaclavas to conceal their identities.

The fingerprints of Anis Abid Sardar, from Wembley, London, were allegedly found on two other bombs at the scene, but not that which killed Sgt Johnson. Mr Sardar, 38, denies murder, conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the court: \"This is an unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence you will see and hear comes from Iraq. \"The Crown's case is that the defendant Mr Sardar was directly involved in making bombs for use in Iraq during 2007. \"As you will hear, he seems to have been based in Syria, probably in the capital city Damascus at relevant times.\" He explained that although the offences took place in Iraq, Mr Sardar is on trial in London as a British citizen. Mr Hill said the bombs \"were not off-the-shelf bombs, they were made with deadly intent\". They were later taken to an FBI laboratory in the US for examination by experts. Sgt Johnson, of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, was killed when the armoured vehicle he was travelling in hit a roadside improvised explosive device (IED). Other US soldiers were seriously injured by the blast and also in a fire-fight while dealing with another IED, the court heard. Fingerprints found on the bomb that killed Sgt Johnson belonged to another man, Sajjad Adnan, who worked with Mr Sardar, the prosecution said. Mr Adnan, who is not British, was handed over to the Iraqi authorities after the bombings and his current whereabouts are unknown, Mr Hill said. Jurors heard Mr Sardar was part of a group that left a number of IEDs buried under the roads west of Baghdad. The bomb that killed Sgt Johnson was part of a sequence, Mr Hill told the court, \"involving bombs concealed geographically quite close together\". Mr Hill said the bomb series was part of a  \"joint effort by the defendant Mr Sardar, together with Adnan and others\". \"That is why it is unnecessary for Mr Sardar to have left his own finger mark on the bomb which killed Sgt Johnson,\" he said. The prosecution made clear that this was an \"unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence... comes from Iraq.\" Nevertheless it is, according to them, lawful to try Anis Sardar here because he is a British citizen who lives and works in London. It is the first time we have seen a prosecution in this country for charges of making improvised explosive devices (IEDs) during the insurgency in Iraq. This has been a case a long time in gestation, since Mr Sardar was arrested seven years after the bombs were recovered from a dusty road west of Baghdad. The jury was told they were forensically analysed by the US authorities in Iraq and America before being examined by British scientists. Though Mr Sardar claimed to have travelled to Syria in 2007 to learn Arabic, the court heard that police found documents in his London home which suggested he already had an advanced understanding of the language. Police searching the property also found a bomb-making manual written in Arabic. The US-led invasion of Iraq began in 2003, amid claims Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. It sparked years of violent conflict with different groups competing for power. British forces ended combat operations in 2009 and the US did so the following year. A total of 179 UK service personnel and nearly 4,500 US soldiers were killed during the conflict.",

The Kremlin has accused Nato of stoking tensions by expanding eastwards. Kaliningrad is a Russian exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. Baltic warning over Russian move on Nato. Missile deployment in Kaliningrad ups the stakes for Nato. In October, Russia sent nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, a move Poland described as of the \"highest concern\". Russia said the deployment was part of military exercises and had happened before. The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad represents an important military outpost between Poland and Lithuania with its coastline on the Baltic Sea. The accumulation of radars and air defence systems, as well as coastal anti-shipping missiles, all form part of Moscow's developing \"anti-access and area denial strategy\", which in essence seeks to push Nato forces away from Russia and to make it very difficult to reinforce Nato members in the Baltic region in the event of a crisis. However, in a separate statement on Monday, the RIA news agency quoted Russian defence committee chairman Viktor Ozerov as saying Iskanders and S-400 surface-to-air missiles were deployed in Kaliningrad to counter a planned US missile defence shield in eastern Europe. The Bastion system fires Oniks cruise missiles, which have a range of up to 280 miles (450km). Russia has already used them in the Syrian civil war where it is supporting President Bashar al-Assad.

Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including if they wear hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers. Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors, and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed. Principal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday. She said in an earlier statement: \"We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted. \"As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason. \"They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn.\" The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for \"adult life\".

Sergio Romero, the Argentina number one, has started all six of United's games so far this season, with Sam Johnstone on the substitutes' bench. The Red Devils still have Victor Valdes after his move to Besiktas collapsed, but he has fallen out with manager Louis van Gaal. De Gea, who has not played for United this season, must first turn his attention to international duty with Spain. They have two Euro 2016 qualifying matches to negotiate, at home to Slovakia on 5 September and in Macedonia on 8 September. They seem pretty relaxed about it all. If De Gea stays, they have a world-class keeper to call on. If he goes, the Navas deal could still happen. Unlike Real, United have a few more hours to do their business. The transfer window may be shut in Spain, but it remains open until 18:00 BST on Tuesday for Premier League clubs. Monday was mostly about letting players leave... But the move that caught a lot of people by surprise involved a French teenager named Anthony Martial. It appears United are willing to pay as much as £36m to get him. A 19-year-old Monaco striker with plenty of potential. He has even been likened to Thierry Henry. Nevertheless, £36m is a lot to pay for a teenager. According to French football journalist Philippe Auclair, the size of the transfer fee has left \"people speechless in France\". \"He's got good technique, good skills, he's a good finisher, but he is still a raw product,\" added Auclair. \"We don't know how far he can go.\"",

Cardiff council's Labour group said it was \"willing to take the lead from public opinion on this issue\". The Mayor for Cardiff campaign was launched earlier this year with a budget of more than Â£20,000. Daran Hill, from the campaign, said at the time that an elected mayor was a \"new, fresh idea\" that could \"energise the people of Cardiff\". There are currently 17 directly-elected mayors in England with more on the way, but there are none in Wales. Mr Govier, a councillor for Cardiff's Grangetown ward, said the debate has \"moved on\" and a regional mayor was now needed. \"We're not going to hit the target, especially because the council refused to allow online petitions,\" he said. \"We feel we've moved the debate on and the focus now needs to switch to a regional mayor for south east Wales. We have to go bigger.\" Mr Govier claimed the Cardiff Capital Region City Deal - a funding package agreed between UK, Welsh and local government worth Â£1.2bn over 20 years - was beginning to stall \"because of governance\". \"The region has to work together on infrastructure and transport,\" he said. \"A regional mayor is needed.\" He added there are \"sympathetic ears throughout the region and across political parties\". Ceredigion is the only Welsh local authority to have had a referendum on the matter. Voters there rejected the idea in 2004 by a margin of nearly three to one. A spokeswoman for Cardiff council's Labour group said: \"Cardiff Labour are willing to take the lead from public opinion on this issue, and as we have seen there is very little interest in introducing a further level of bureaucracy. \"The City Deal is definitely not stalling and is moving forward, despite uncertainty caused by Brexit. \"It will be a huge boost for Cardiff and the region, and suggestions to the contrary are just mischief making.\" A Wales Office spokesman said: \"The Cardiff City Deal is the biggest of its kind in the UK and we are confident this ambitious project is on target.\" The Welsh Government declined to comment in response to Mr Govier's comments.",

Satisfaction with the work of councils is highest in North East England - but still less than one in three are happy. People have rated councils better than national government in past studies. Voters will go to the polls on 5 May to elect more than 9,500 councillors in nearly 280 councils across England. Research by polling firm YouGov, designed to coincide with the election campaign, has suggested that the majority of voters casting their ballots next month will do so not knowing any of the candidates. It asked more than 2,000 people aged over 18 across the UK whether they could name any of their local councillors. Recognition was highest in Scotland, where 47% of those canvassed were able to identify one of their local representatives. In Northern Ireland, the figure was 46%, while in Wales, the figure was 44%. Across the English regions, recognition was highest in the North East of England - at 43%. But in six regions - the East Midlands, the East of England, the West Midlands, London, the south west of England and the south east - less than one in three of those asked could identify the person representing them. Asked whether the local authority addressed the needs of their local communities, only 20% of people living in the North West of England said it did. Approval levels were highest in the North East (31%), the West Midlands (28%) and Wales (27%). Social networking site Streetlife, which commissioned the research, suggested it demonstrated there was a \"real disconnection\" between residents of local communities and those representing them. The findings contrast with those of the Hansard Society, whose recent audit of political engagement concluded that awareness and satisfaction with local politics had increased since last year's general election. It found that more than two out of three people were interested in how local services were provided and nearly half believed they were being delivered well - much higher than at a national level. The Hansard Society also found name recognition was also a problem for national politicians, with only 38% of people able to name their own MP. But its research suggested that interest in local politics did not translate into a wish to become involved - with only one in ten people saying their were likely to volunteer in their communities over the next couple of years. Elections are taking place next month in 36 metropolitan boroughs, including Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds and Sheffield, as well as 49 unitary authorities and 194 district councils - the biggest test of popular opinion since last year's general election.

    "document": "Ministers shelved Wednesday's vote on relaxing hunting laws in England and Wales after the SNP said it would vote against the changes. The party had previously said it would not vote on issues affecting England and Wales only. Mr Cameron said the SNP's position was \"entirely opportunistic\". Downing Street said it was \"disappointing\" that the vote had to be postponed, and said new proposals on the Hunting Act would be introduced \"in due course\". The government has said the hunting vote will now be held after plans to give English MPs a veto on matters affecting only England - although this would not stop the hunting issue having to be voted on by the whole House of Commons. Ms Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, said the decision to delay the hunting vote showed \"David Cameron can't carry his own parliamentary group\", and that he only had a \"slender and fragile\" majority. She said he had also been forced to pull his English votes for English laws plans, showing that he was \"not master of all he surveys in the House of Commons\". She said if he \"had any sense\", he would come back with proposals based on \"fairness and reasonableness\" that \"work in both directions\". Earlier she had explained her party's decision to take part in the hunting vote, saying there had been \"overwhelming demand\" from people in England. Another reason, she said, was because David Cameron was making Scottish MPs \"second-class citizens\" in the House of Commons. Mark D'Arcy, BBC Parliamentary correspondent. With two strategic retreats in the space of a week, the intersection of Hunting and English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) is generating some really interesting politics. Last week, the government paused its attempt to bring in EVEL, replacing a vote on Wednesday with a consultative debate. Today another \"turn your back and run away, and live to fight another day\" moment on the proposed changes to the Hunting Act. Read the blog in full. The government plans to change Commons rules to allow English, or English and Welsh, MPs a \"decisive say\" on legislation only applying there. However, the current proposals would not prevent SNP MPs from voting against the changes. Downing Street said there were no plans to change the current proposals. This is because the statutory instrument ministers want to use to change the law would require the support of the whole of the House of Commons. The government's decision to reschedule the vote came as anti-hunting protesters gathered at the Houses of Parliament to protest against changing the law. The changes would have brought the Hunting Act in line with Scotland, where an unlimited number of dogs can be used to \"flush out\" a fox to be shot, compared to just two in England and Wales. It's been a rollercoaster week for the old, bitter enemies on each side of this debate. Last Wednesday - Budget day - there was quiet jubilation in hunts in England and Wales at the prospect of the loathed Hunting Act being relaxed. Dignity would be restored: they could hunt without their every move being filmed. Animal welfare groups were devastated: it was a sneaky step, hunting would be back, and they only had a week to mobilise. Now with the abandonment of the vote, their fortunes have apparently been reversed. But this isn't a tale of victory and defeat. Both sides now know the government's desire to change the Hunting Act. They are digging in for a much more protracted fight that could - believe it or not - become even more bitter. But the 56 SNP MPs, plus Labour and some Conservative MPs opposed to hunting, meant the government's change stood little chance of being approved in Wednesday's free vote. The SNP says it will now consider tightening the law in Scotland to match England and Wales. Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said: \"David Cameron is now running scared because he knew he was going to lose the vote on fox-hunting.\" Meanwhile, a poll for the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show has suggested almost three in four British adults are against making fox hunting legal. The poll, conducted by ComRes, asked 1,005 people if the practice \"should or should not be made legal again?\".",

    "document": "One of the highest ranking military officials of his time, more than 30 places around the world now bear his name. In Guernsey, where he was governor for 24 years, a school, a road and a former hospital were named after him. However, in the US Lord Amherst has become a dubious figure because of his connection with biological warfare. Earlier this year students at liberal arts institution Amherst College, Massachusetts, voted to remove 'Lord Jeff' as their unofficial mascot in light of accusations he approved the wiping out of Native Americans by deliberately giving them smallpox via infected blankets. As the commander-in-chief of the British army in pre-independence north America, Jeffery Amherst is said to have \"both despised and hated his enemy\" according to the historian Henry Morse Stephens. In a postscript to a fellow British officer Henry Bouquet, he appears to have written: \"You will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race. \"I should be very glad your scheme for hunting them down by dogs could take effect, but England is at too great a distance to think of that at present.\" Other higher education institutions including the University of Cape Town and Oxford University have faced student protests because of their association with another colonial figure, the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes.  The 'Rhodes Must Fall' campaign led to UCT removing a statue of the 19th Century politician. Professor Elizabeth Fenn, an historian at the University of Colorado, who researched the Amherst smallpox incident told the BBC: \"I am relieved and delighted to see the wholehearted rejection of Jeffery Amherst. \"He advocated genocide, the 'total erxtirpation' of native peoples. The question we should ask is why did it take us so long?\" In Montreal more than 6,500 people signed an online petition to rename the city's Amherst Street after a former Premier of Quebec Jacques Parizeau, who died in 2015. The campaign, launched that year, continues. Some researchers have argued that the British general deserves an honourable position in history for his personal achievements, one of which was the capture of Montreal in 1760. Morse Stephens wrote: \"Though not a great man... his personal qualities were undeniable, and he could not have been an ordinary man to have risen from page to Duke of Dorset to be field-marshal commanding-in-chief.\" Whether Sir Jeffery Amherst ever visited Guernsey during his time as governor of the island is not known, but his legacy lives on today in several places; Amherst Primary School, Amherst Road and the Amherst Room at Castle Cornet. There was an Amherst Maternity Hospital in St Peter Port but the site was redeveloped for housing. Local historian, Colonel Richard Graham, said that Lord Amherst had been viewed as a national hero \"in whose reflected glory Guernsey bathed over the 24 years of his time in office\". So have recent events overseas had any bearing on the general's reputation in Guernsey? Mr Graham said historical figures like Jeffery Amherst should be judged by the standards of their time. \"I believe strongly that they should be judged and accepted by the mores of the time they lived rather than by ours. \"In a hundred years' time, our actions will be similarly scrutinised and there will be some judgemental souls who will see evil in stuff we currently regard as harmless. \"That is not to say that hideous conduct as seen in the evils of Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot are any the less hideous for having taken place when they did and within the world as it was. \"But even these abominations need to be explained and understood as if from their time if the appropriate lessons are to be drawn from history.\" The island's Education Department and a St Peter Port Parish official told the BBC that no one had approached them about renaming local places called Amherst.",

    "document": "Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65% to 17% majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have both made it clear they don't think now is the time to hold a border poll. Sinn Fein are campaigning for a poll and the DUP have discussed, in their words, calling Sinn Fein's bluff. But after weeks of controversy about flags and national identity, politicians' claims about Catholic unionism, and a census showing a growing number identifying themselves as Northern Irish, what lies behind that headline figure in the Spotlight opinion poll is particularly revealing. Not surprisingly, more than 90% of those who identify themselves as Protestants told the pollsters they wanted to stay in the UK. But on the other side of the religious divide, a substantial 38% of Catholics also favoured remaining within the UK - three percentage points more than the number who backed a united Ireland. While only 5% of Protestants don't intend to vote or haven't decided which option they would pick, more than a quarter of Catholics are either undecided or not planning on voting. As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23% - told the pollsters they would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56% - also said they would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers itself \"Northern Irish\". That posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified themselves as \"Northern Irish\" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72% to just 7%. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that his party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make this a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97% Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99% Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99% Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92% Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51% Protestant backing and 36% Catholic support. Alliance's support for a \"designated days\" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party's offices and a death threat against its only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44% backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35% wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10% told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2% opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73% of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64% of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made its decision in early December. This result may reflect some people's belief in the right to protest, even if they don't back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. They told the pollsters this was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business. Although the Stormont politicians might take heart from this shift of opinion, the protest organisers will point to the fact that by late January 45% of unionists still believed the demonstrations should continue. This shows a degree of resilience given the barrage of negative publicity generated by the protests. The poll was carried out for the BBC Spotlight programme by Ipsos Mori, whose researchers interviewed more than 1000 adults at 64 locations across Northern Ireland between 17 and 26 January. The full details are available as a pdf, 897kb in size. They include findings on how people rated individual politicians' handling of the flags crisis, which parties those interviewed support and whether those surveyed believe the Stormont system favours one community over another.",

The song's video, which also premiered on Friday, has been watched more than 70 million times on YouTube. Directed by Canadian film-maker Xavier Dolan, the video sees Adele raking the coals of a faded relationship. Her ex-boyfriend is played in flashback scenes by Tristan Wilds, a former child actor from acclaimed crime series The Wire, who released his own Grammy-nominated album,  New York: A Love Story, in 2013. According to Entertainment Weekly, it is also the first music video to be shot with large-format IMAX cameras. Hello is the lead single from Adele's third album, 25, which is due out on 20 November. Reviews for the single have been overwhelmingly positive. The Guardian called it \"striking, witty and lovelorn\"; while the Telegraph described it as \"a beautiful song of loss and regret\". Following its release on Friday, it topped the iTunes chart in 102 countries, and the album topped the pre-order chart in 93 countries. In the UK, Hello is expected to have the biggest opening week of the year, beating Ellie Goulding's Love Me Like You Do, which achieved 173,000 combined sales and streams in February. The star could also smash a US record for selling the most downloads in a single week - set in 2009 when Flo Rida's Right Round was bought 636,000 times.

    "document": "A ruling will allow users and expert analysts to carry out repairs. But changes such as extracting and selling code would still breach copyright. Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues. The ruling follows claims the right to modify software could have prevented the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported. Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation. \"Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented,\" the statement said. Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright. Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are \"pervasive\" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices. \"We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers,\" said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes.

The new rules must be renewed in three years, he said. Some US government agencies expressed serious reservations about the new rules, and the Environmental Protection Agency flatly opposed them. \"EPA explained that vehicle modifications are often performed to increase engine power or boost fuel economy, but that these modifications increase vehicle emissions and thus violate the Clean Air Act,\" the Library of Congress said in its final rule. However, the new rules do not allow vehicle owners to break any other laws, the Library said, and will not take effect for a year so the EPA and other agencies have time to prepare.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The finding was one of the takeaways from a US central bank survey of more than 6,640 adults published on Friday. In total, the number of respondents with no more than a high-school diploma who said they were \"living comfortably\" or \"doing okay\" fell to 60% from 61%. Overall, the annual survey showed US economic health improving. Some 70% of respondents said they were either \"living comfortably\" or \"doing okay,\" up from 69% the year before, and 62% in 2013 when the Federal Reserve started the survey. But there were continuing signs of instability, with over a third of US households (35%) saying they could not cover their monthly bills or an unexpected $400 (Â£307) expense, according to the survey. The survey also suggested that disparities between households with different education levels was growing. Gap between rich and poor 'keeps growing' Enriching the rich in the US - but what about the rest? \"A clear pattern over the past two years across these measures is that the improvements have been most pronounced among those with greater levels of education,\" researchers wrote in the report. Nearly 100 million Americans have no education beyond high school, according to US government estimates. (The estimate excludes members of the military and people in institutional facilities such as prison.) That fact is tied to wide differences, the survey found. About 46% of adults with at least a college degree reported family incomes of $100,000 or more, compared to just 9% of respondents with a high school degree or less. Adults with at least a college degree were more likely to report earning money from online activities - such as renting out properties using a website - and more likely to have a steady stream of income from month-to-month. They were also more likely to say they received a raise in the last year, and more likely to say it exceeded the growth in their expenses. \"The thing is that earnings are so highly correlated with education and employment,\" said Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. \"It's hard to imagine how a sense of financial wellbeing would not be correlated with education.\" Jobs in sectors that once supplied well-paid work for school leavers,  such as manufacturing, have fallen. At the same time, the overall labour market has become more unstable as employers cut back on benefits and pay rises. The share of Americans in the workforce is also shrinking - particularly among those with lower levels of education, said Valerie Wilson, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \"The workers we would expect to have the strongest labour attachments have actually been becoming less attached,\" she said. Among survey respondents who did not attend college, nearly 40% said it was too expensive or that they needed to earn money. Their status was also closely tied to whether their parents had attended college. But Ms Baum said simply getting everyone to go to college is not the solution. \"There could be more work done to equalise things at the level of higher education but the problem is never going to be solved just at the college level,\" she said.",

Noor Alam Khan Abdul Wahid Khan, the immigration department director of the Malaysian state Sabah, told the BBC Hawkins left Kota Kinabalu for Kuala Lumpur at 17:35 local time (10:35 BST) on Malaysia Airlines. The other three, Dutch national Dylan Snel, 23, and Canadian siblings Lindsey, 23, and Danielle Peterson, 22, left earlier on Saturday for Kuala Lumpur.

Many of the items will be seen together for the first time in the exhibition, which opens on Thursday and features about 130 artworks from the latter stage of Matisse's career. The Telegraph said that \"the joy of the cut-outs is their simplicity\". The paper's critic said the artworks were made from \"modest materials\" using \"basic techniques\" but that the artist \"reduces art to the essentials of colour, shape and pattern\". \"Yet precisely because they offer us instant visual gratification, it is easy to forget how innovative they actually are,\" he wrote. The Guardian added that the show was \"ravishing, filled with light and decoration, exuberance and a kind of violence\" adding that it was \"about more than just pleasure\". \"Matisse created a universe that filled the room around him, spilling from the walls to the floor.\" Matisse worked from a wheelchair after treatment for cancer and the exhibition compiles work dating from 1937 to 1954, when he died aged 84 of a heart attack. Sir Nicholas Serota, the Tate director and co-curator of the show, told the BBC the works displayed great skill. \"Cut-out sounds a bit simplistic, they are very sophisticated objects. \"The brilliance is that he took the method of a child and deployed it with all the sophistication of an artist who had been painting for 60 years.\" He said that the artworks were \"incredibly influential\" on a generation of American painters in the 60s and 70s. \"The colour is really intense, the colour is brilliant, it's really not quite what we associate with the immediate post-war years in Europe. He's really on his own.\" The Economic Voice added that the exhibition \"re-examines the cut-outs in terms of the methods and materials that Matisse used, and their double lives, first as contingent and mutable in the studio and ultimately as permanent works through mounting and framing\".

The violence is the first in Beirut since the conflict began in neighbouring Syria in March last year. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says the incident shows how divided the Lebanese are over the Syrian crisis. It follows a week of clashes in the northern city of Tripoli between anti-Syrian Sunnis and Alawites who support the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Syrian and Lebanese politics have been deeply intertwined throughout the history of the two states. Syria, the dominant partner, had a large military presence in Lebanon for 29 years, finally withdrawing soldiers in 2005, but maintaining a strong influence. Political factions in Lebanon have often defined themselves as pro- or anti-Syrian. By Jim MuirBBC News, Beirut. Given how deeply and sharply Lebanon is divided over Syria, it's a miracle that there hasn't been much more violence than there has. But the killing of two Sunni clerics at a Lebanese Army checkpoint in the north of the country on Sunday could hardly pass without consequence - though the fallout could have been much greater. Only in Beirut did the tension break into open conflict. And it was restricted to a clash between Sunni groups, with the mainstream Future faction of Saad al-Hariri using the occasion to squeeze out the small, pro-Syrian Arab Movement Party, whose leader Shaker Berjawi fled. In nearby areas of south Beirut, Hezbollah - the most powerful force in the land - kept well out of it. Political and religious leaders from all sides urged restraint, while the government pledged a vigorous enquiry into the death of the two shaikhs. Divisions over Syria are the defining issue in Lebanese politics. Everybody knows how real the danger is that the country would be torn apart if those differences are allowed to erupt freely onto the streets. Sunday's violence was triggered by the shooting dead of two Sunni sheikhs linked to the anti-Syrian Future movement, headed by opposition leader Saad al-Hariri, at a Lebanese army checkpoint in the north on Sunday. Supporters of Mr Hariri responded by blocking main roads with burning car tyres, but security forces intervened to clear them. In Beirut's southern district of Tariq al-Jadideh, offices of a local pro-Syrian leader came under attack by gunmen. Rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun fire were heard for much of the night. But the clashes died away after the leader, Shaker Berjawi, left the area, and the Lebanese Army moved in. Sunni religious and political leaders have called for the utmost restraint, and an investigation has been launched into the killing of the two sheikhs. Correspondents say there are fears of a return to the violence seen in clashes between Sunni and Shia Muslims in 2008 which brought the country close to civil war.",

However, Kenyans on Twitter have been using the hashtag #TurudiKaziniChallenge (Swahili for \"Let's return to work\" ) to urge a return to normalcy following last week's disruptions. Mr Kenyatta repeated his appeal for peace. \"At the end of the day we are all Kenyans, we don't need to fight one  another, we don't need to destroy each other's property, we don't need to take  life,\" he said in a statement. \"Kenyans have said that the election is behind them, the majority have  returned to work,\" he added.

But the manifesto stretches far beyond the initial nine point plan, with a huge document some 194 pages long.

They include ensuring earlier diagnosis of disease and better access to life-saving treatments. \"Overall we will reduce preventable deaths by 25% by 2026,\" the manifesto says.

It says it would create a \"National Network of Acute and Specialist Hospitals\", and consult on whether this will be run directly by the Welsh Government's Department of Health or by an arms-length NHS Board. Community health services, such as GPs' surgeries, district nurses and mental health, would be run by local government. Local health boards would be replaced with a \"Community NHS\" system delivered through new Regional Combined Authorities - new strategic bodies that will provide strategic planning for local government. Plaid Cymru thinks the current tuition fee grant scheme is unsustainable and wants to end it and replace it with an entirely new system.

As well as that, the manifesto promises to restore the Welsh Development Agency to promote trade and investment in Wales. Plaid says it would:. Plaid Cymru is backing the blue route \"or a variation of it\" to improve the M4. It also says it will invest in improvements to the A55. It also pledges to:. Plaid says it will \"produce proposals\" for the reform of the present council tax system into a domestic property tax, which the party says would be fairer for those in less expensive properties. Partial powers on income tax are due to be devolved in the next assembly term - and Plaid is pledging not to increase it. The party says replacing council tax would allow the scope to introduce a middle rate of income tax which will be lower than the current UK higher rate of 40%. Plaid also promising to raise the stamp duty threshold from £125,000 to £145,000, which the manifesto says would remove \"over half of all buyers out of tax altogether\". The party says it will:. Plaid Cymru say they will 're-direct' more than £1bn of the Welsh Government's £15bn budget through ending some schemes and finding savings elsewhere. These savings include:. That cash would be used to fund the party's programme, together withplanned increased to the Welsh Government's block grant by the UK Government. The constitution isn't devolved, but Plaid Cymru say they'd propose the establishment of a constitutional convention to put together a new framework for co-operation between the different parts of the UK.

The manifesto says the party reserves \"the right to call a referendum in Wales on the principle of a confederal UK if the UK government refuses to establish a UK-wide convention\". But it adds that, provided its confederation plans can be achieved in a \"reasonable\" timeframe, the party does \"not plan to hold a referendum on Welsh independence in the near term\".

The directive, which takes effect on 16 March, places a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim nations and a 120-day ban on all refugees. The previous order, which was blocked by a federal court, sparked confusion at airports and mass protests. \"Nothing of substance has changed: There is the same blanket ban on entry from Muslim-majority countries (minus one),\" Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said of the new order. It will bar entry of citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. Iraq, which was included in the first ban, has been taken off the list. Mr Chin also said the directive included \"the same sweeping shutdown of refugee admissions (absent one exception) and lawless warren of exceptions and waivers\", despite the changes made. The new order lifts an indefinite ban on those from Syria. It will also no longer affect legal US permanent residents, and drops controversial language about giving priority to religious minorities. These amendments were introduced in response to legal complaints, which saw the first order blocked by US federal courts. Judges ruled that the ban was unconstitutional amid concerns it unfairly targeted Muslims, something the government denied. Hawaii was among a number of states who filed lawsuits against the original ban saying it would harm residents, businesses and schools. It filed a fresh complaint late on Wednesday, calling for an emergency block on the new order. A hearing is set for March 15, a day before the new ban is to go into effect. President Trump has not yet commented on Hawaii's latest legal bid, but has previously insisted he has the right to enact such an executive order and hit out at \"so political\" courts. Speaking to local news channel Khon 2, Mr Chin said the new ban had the same \"nation-of-origin discrimination problems\" as the first. He said this was a particularly sensitive issue in Hawaii because of memories of Japanese internment camps on the Pacific island during World War Two. Although the new directive sought to answer legal complaints, Mr Chin said it still constituted a \"Muslim ban\" because of the countries involved and statements from administration officials. In justifying the ban on Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said there are more than 300 refugees under investigation for potential terror offences. But no further details were given. The US appeals court previously criticised the government for failing to provide \"evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order\" had committed a terrorist attack in the US.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Eleven care workers are to be sentenced later for the maltreatment and neglect of five patients at Winterbourne View. But a BBC Inside Out West investigation has found evidence of alleged abuse involving different staff members. Police have agreed the assault on Ben Pullar was \"not acceptable\" but said they would not re-open the case. Mr Pullar is autistic and bi-polar, with severe learning difficulties, and when he was 18, he spent almost a year at Winterbourne View from July 2009. He lost two teeth when he was punched in the face. His twin, Tom, said his behaviour changed drastically after going to the hospital. \"He's burst out crying on me and demanded to talk about Winterbourne View - and this is two years after Winterbourne View - so it still affects him today,\" said the 21-year-old. The BBC has seen daily care notes from his time at the hospital which state Mr Pullar \"had an accident with his teeth\" just weeks after he arrived. His family said they were given mixed messages about what happened and were told at one point he had \"bitten the floor\". He was taken to Bristol Dental Hospital by Winterbourne View staff as an emergency patient, and two doctors there raised the alarm with the authorities because of the severity of his injuries. Senior dental consultant Dr Jane Luker said: \"I think they thought the injury he sustained wasn't consistent with what they were being told. \"He had allegedly bitten a carer and the injuries were sustained from him biting that carer. \"[But] because the teeth were pushed back palatally, towards the back of the mouth, it would be consistent with a punch or a blow to the front of the face.\" The authorities met several days after Mr Pullar was assaulted, but his family was not invited. Tom Pullar said: \"I think that care staff are supposed to care for patients, not punch them.\" Notes obtained by Inside Out said the nurse was bitten and retaliated in order to remove his fingers - and later, that he had pushed and pulled to get them out. The nurse involved, Maxwell Nyamukapa, was suspended and later reinstated. Despite repeated attempts to contact Mr Nyamukapa, he has refused to comment. The police logged it as an assault, and said the nurse had acted instinctively and in self-defence. Forty concerns were raised about patients in just over three years with the local safeguarding board run by South Gloucestershire Council. The police were also contacted 29 times, nine of those times related to carers suspected of using restraint of involved in violent incidents with patients - including Mr Pullar. Det Ch Supt Louisa Rolfe, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: \"We have carried out an extensive investigation into incidents at Winterbourne View and no stone has been left unturned. \"We consulted with the CPS and our partners in terms of action we could take. \"Looking back on that incident now and understanding the whole pattern of what was happening at that residential hospital, it is clearly not acceptable. \"However, at the time, the officer was dealing with information, reliable information, that came from patients and carers, and that came from other experts in that field. And perhaps they relied upon that information too much.\" She added: \"We accept that there is learning for us as an organisation and we will do things differently in future.\" Det Ch Supt Rolfe said the force had carried out an extensive investigation into incidents at the hospital and had improved how it dealt with people with learning disabilities. The council has declined to comment on Mr Pullar's case. Castlebeck, the hospital's owner at the time, said its new board and management had already, and would continue to, rigorously review what happened at Winterbourne View. The firm said if any other matters come to light, immediate action would be taken and the appropriate authorities informed. It has also referred Mr Nyamukapa twice to the Nursing & Midwifery Council, who declined to comment. Inside Out West is on BBC One West at 7.30pm on Monday or for seven days after on the iPlayer.",

    "document": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja. The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory. Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.",

Overnight on Friday the pound temporarily plunged by 6%, in a flash crash that is thought to have been triggered by automated trading. Shares in Sports Direct closed down 9% on Friday. The company had expected to report underlying profit of £300m based on the pound trading at $1.30 against the dollar. However, the retailer said that \"extreme movements overnight\" would result \"in a negative impact of approximately £15m\" on its results for the current financial year. The swings overnight hit the company's hedging arrangements, which are designed to protect a business against volatile currency prices. It also sustained a large loss in its last financial year because of currency movements. In that case, because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, it took a £65m hit. As a result, Sports Direct reported underlying earnings of £381.4m for the year to 24 April against expectations of £420m, resulting in staff missing out on a bonus. It has been a tumultuous year for Sports Direct which has been criticised for working conditions at its Shirebrook distribution centre.

The Israeli military used its Iron Dome defence system to intercept and destroy the missile. A fifth battery had been added to it, just outside the city, only hours earlier. After the explosion, close to the coast, a small black cloud was left hanging in the sky over the sea. Tel Aviv is Israel's largest city and commercial centre but it is also a popular place to relax or party. However, despite the sunshine, outdoor restaurants, parks and pavements were much quieter over the weekend. It has taken a psychological adjustment for locals to realise that they too are now within the firing range of certain Palestinian rockets - believed to be the Iranian-made Fajr-5, which can reach up to 75km (45 miles). \"For Tel Aviv people this is a bit of a shock. The rockets hit all the time in the north and south of Israel but in Tel Aviv this never happens. I've lived here for ten years,\" said a jogger, Tzipi. Soli, who was carrying his little daughter, remarked: \"Everyone is talking about it. You can see the streets are emptier than usual and this is from just a few missiles.\" But he said there was broad support for the continuing military offensive in the Gaza Strip. \"I'm not happy with the situation where we are bombing Gaza but I think we have to do it, we have to defend ourselves,\" he said. A retired man, Amos, agreed that Palestinian militants posed a real threat. \"We have to finish this problem. This is the language they understand, not the language of peace,\" he said. Asked about the government decision to authorise the call-up of up to 75,000 military reservists, he gave his strong approval. \"We have the force. We need to have it,\" he said. \"I'm sorry about it but this is our life, our destiny.\" With Israeli troops continuing to head towards the Gaza border and speculation about a possible ground invasion, this is a difficult time for families with members serving in the military. \"I'm very worried because my son is doing his national service. He will go south,\" one man said as his wife's eyes filled with tears. \"This is what happens, I cry every time I think of my son,\" she added. The Israeli military, which has its vast headquarters in Tel Aviv, told the BBC that its offensive was putting Hamas, which governs Gaza, \"under great pressure\". However, spokeswoman Avital Leibovich confirmed that incursions still remained a possibility. \"We are getting ready for an option of ground operation. It's not decided yet but it's an option we're considering at this point,\" she said. \"Some troops were asked to approach specific areas surrounding the Gaza Strip. Some are already there, some are on their way.\" In the southern part of Tel Aviv, journalists were shown around the emergency control room for the municipality, located in an underground shelter. It is set up like a military command centre with maps on the walls and a long table positioned in front of projector screens and televisions. It would act as a back-up for city hall if the security situation demanded it. The mayor, Ron Huldai, said that residents had already adjusted well to the changed safety information and the use of sirens. \"People in the city of Tel Aviv know how to behave,\" he said. \"The solution is to find your way to the safest place in your area and there are instructions in the newspaper with the rules you have to follow. \"They're taking this seriously but not changing their routine. We are prepared.\"",

He goes back to the Nou Camp in the Champions League next week knowing the task facing his City side is immense. \"Barcelona are special in the way they play. They're a machine,\" he said. With former Barcelona officials Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain as chief executive and director of football respectively, and Guardiola as manager, there is clear influence from the Catalan giants at City. But Guardiola knows it is going to take time to achieve the identity Barcelona have forged over the past half a century. \"For the last decade, the last 50 years, Barcelona dominate football matches. I love the way they play,\" he added. \"They have three amazing players - Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar - up front. They are amazing on the counter-attack. They have a good build-up. They are a good team.\" Guardiola accepts City may have a confidence problem facing Barca, given Saturday's 1-1 draw against Everton in the Premier League means they have gone three games without a win. Kevin de Bruyne and Sergio Aguero both had penalties saved by Everton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg, meaning Aguero has failed five times from the spot so far this season, including two for Argentina. Guardiola says he does not have a problem with that, and Everton manager Ronald Koeman, who played with him in Barcelona's European Cup final success over Sampdoria at Wembley in 1992, feels City have nothing to worry about at all. He said: \"They are the best team I have played against in my managerial career. \"If you look to the football, to the offensive style, the movement, the quality of the players in midfield and in front, then they are the best team in the Premier League. \"Maybe we didn't deserve a point on chances but football is unpredictable and our goalkeeper maybe played his best game ever.\"",

In the footage, which has been widely shared on social media, the policeman headbutts, slaps and kicks the driver as they quarrel beside the lorry. The incident happened at Wadi Joz, an Arab area in occupied East Jerusalem. Police said the officer involved had shown \"severe and unusual behaviour\" and had been placed on forced leave. The video, which was recorded by a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, has been passed to the police investigation unit. Apparently filmed on a dashcam of another vehicle, it shows the officer remonstrating with the lorry driver. The Jerusalem Post newspaper said the incident reportedly arose over an issue with the parking of the lorry. The Palestinian appears to be explaining something and emphasising a point, whereupon the officer headbutts him and slaps him back and forth across the head. As the driver clutches his head and bends over, the policeman knees him in the stomach then punches him on the back of the head. At this point, two more individuals arrive and start remonstrating with the policeman, who shoves one of them backwards. He pushes back at the policeman, who then kicks out at him. The edited video then cuts to a moment where the second man apparently strikes the policeman on the side of the face, before a third man steps in and tries to calm the policeman down. The footage drew outrage from Israeli Arab politicians. Member of the Knesset Ahmad Tibi called for the officer to be arrested and prosecuted. \"It is brutal behaviour of mafia and gang members, not people who are responsible for law and order,\" he said. Israel's Public Security Minister, Gilad Erdan, condemned the officer's actions. \"There is no place for such behaviour in the [police] force and I hope that the police investigation unit will prosecute him to the full extent of the law,\" he said.",

Brown Rudnick also claimed it could help Cerberus \"position itself effectively with key stakeholders\". Cerberus chief operating officer Mark Neporent said Brown Rudnick claimed that they could get access to the executive via the Belfast law firm Tughans. \"They told us they could get us access to other stakeholders... the Northern Ireland Executive, people in the Republic,\" he said. Mr Neporent is giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee in Dublin. Cerberus agreed to hire Brown Rudnick on 24 March 2014 and on 25 March the Cerberus chairman Dan Quayle met First Minister Peter Robinson at Stormont. Mr Neporent agreed with committee member Mary Lou McDonald that Brown Rudnick \"were as good as their word\"  in getting access. Nama, an Irish state agency, was established in 2009 to take control of billions of euro of bad property loans which were damaging the Irish banks. Controversy has surrounded the sales process. Brown Rudnick and Tughans had previously been working with another fund, Pimco, which was bidding for the portfolio. Pimco withdrew from the bidding process when it emerged that its fee arrangement with the firms was to involve a payment to Frank Cushnahan, a former Nama advisor. Cerberus then engaged Brown Rudnick on what it terms \"a success fee only basis\", meaning a fee would only be paid if the deal was done. Brown Rudnick agreed to share the success fee with Tughans.

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The Republic of Ireland currently has strict abortion laws, which only allow a pregnancy to be terminated if there is a serious risk to a woman's life. The Citizens' Assembly voted 64% to 36% in favour of having no restrictions. Anti-abortion groups have condemned the result of the vote, but any change to the law would require a referendum. The Citizens' Assembly was set up by the Oireachtas (Irish Houses of Parliament) to advise elected representatives on a number of ethical and political dilemmas facing the Irish people. These include abortion, climate change and how the Republic of Ireland deals with the challenge of providing for its aging population. The body is made up of 99 members who were chosen at random to broadly represent the views of the Irish electorate. Its most controversial task was to consider a campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution - which gives an equal right to life to a pregnant woman and an unborn child. Assembly members held 10 days of intensive and emotive debates over the past five months, culminating in this weekend's series of votes. On Saturday, members voted against repealing the Eighth Amendment, but they did support change - voting to amend or replace the law. On Sunday, a majority of Citizens' Assembly members approved 13 separate grounds for legal terminations in the Republic of Ireland. Of the votes cast, 89% were in favour of allowing abortion on grounds of rape or fatal foetal abnormality - when doctors believe an unborn child is likely to die before, during or shortly after birth. There was less support for legal terminations for \"socio-economic reasons\" but still, 72% of members who took part voted in favour of abortion in those circumstances. However, anti-abortion campaigners dismissed the results of the ballots as a \"muddled and confused farce\". Cora Sherlock of the Pro Life Campaign accused the assembly of having a \"chaotic\" and \"one-sided approach\" in how it conducted its business from the beginning. She added: \"There is nothing liberal or progressive about the assembly recommending a referendum to strip unborn babies of their right to life in law and also ignoring the negative consequences of abortion for women.\" The Citizens' Assembly is chaired by the Supreme Court judge, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, who will now present a report on members' recommendations to the Oireachtas by late June. In a statement, the chair said members had \"reached a conclusion of sorts\" and she thanked them for having \"engaged with some of the most complex pieces of legislation, immersed themselves in medical and ethical discourse, and listened with respect to the voices and opinions of others\". \"I also wish to acknowledge those whose perspectives or opinions did not emerge in the final vote,\" the judge added. \"This is an exercise in deliberative democracy and their vote remains important to me because of the very fact it captures that other perspective, that dissenting voice, the different interpretation and I wish to assure them that their votes and voices will be recorded and have a place in the report.\" On receipt of her report, elected representatives will consider members' calls for a change in the law, and whether or not to hold a referendum.",

    "document": "The Times Educational Supplement (TES) says measures to guard against grade inflation were not appropriate for this year's English exams. Teaching unions have accused Ofqual of \"regulatory failure\" and say it is more evidence of flawed exam marking. But the regulator insists it applied its measures correctly. It comes as state and private school heads call for an independent inquiry into the problems. Last week Ofqual said it felt the way this year's English GCSE exams were graded was fair, despite the  grade boundaries being moved significantly part-way through the year. Teachers have complained that pupils achieving exactly the same marks would have received different grades depending on what time of year they sat the exam. And many who were predicted a grade C, obtained a grade D in their summer exams. Ofqual found that June's grade boundaries were correct, while January's were \"too lenient\". A key document sent to exam boards, which is on the Ofqual website, sets out how it expects exam boards to use a process known as \"comparable outcomes\" to ensure that grade standards are maintained between GCSEs year-on-year. It sets out five conditions for when such processes should be used to alter the way papers are marked. According to the TES report, this year's English GCSE and the circumstances around it failed to meet four of the conditions. The first of Ofqual's five conditions was that the cohort - or pupils from that year- in a subject \"must be similar, in terms of ability, to those of previous years\". But last week's report on English GCSEs noted that the \"attainment profile\" for 2012 dropped, as grammar and independent school pupils were replaced with extra, lower-achieving comprehensive pupils. The second condition was that the qualification must be \"fit for purpose\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament that this year's English GCSE was \"not fit for purpose\". The third condition was that the \"nature of the qualification\" must be the same. Ofqual's report last week stated that \"these qualifications are different from previous English qualifications in a number of ways\". Finally, the regulator said in the letter that comparable outcomes must only be applied where \"previous grades were appropriate\". Ofqual's report said that the English GCSE grades in January were \"too generous\". The only condition that appears to have been met is that teaching standards have remained largely consistent. The guidelines also state: \"Students should not be advantaged or disadvantaged simply because they were the first to sit a new set of examinations.\" The watchdog has interpreted its own conditions differently, and is insisting that the comparable outcomes approach that prevented grades from rising in June was correctly implemented. But Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT heads' union, said: \"Ofqual doesn't seem to have applied the concept of comparable outcomes properly. \"In this instance there is a regulatory failure. It is a big mess.\" And Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said this appeared to be \"another piece of evidence that procedures applied to this exam was not fit for purpose\". Meanwhile, Ofqual said: \"The comparable outcomes approach was used correctly for GCSE English this year and we stand by this decision. \"Comparable outcomes are not intended to produce identical results year on year. \"What's important is that outcomes can be compared when taking into consideration a range of factors which may affect the results. More details on the use of this approach can be found in our report.\" But Dr Christopher Ray, chairman of the Head Masters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), said the issue was evidence of a deeper problem with Ofqual. \"The verdict of Ofqual's initial report and the reasoning to support it fall well short of answering the questions raised in the minds of schools and pupils.\" Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: \"It is clear that pupils, parents and education professionals, across the spectrum of schools, feel that pupils have been done a disservice. \"Whilst the Education Secretary Michael Gove says he is 'saddened' by the injustice that has been served to thousands of pupils, he is showing how out-of-touch he is with pupil opinion by refusing to take action. Labour supports calls for an independent inquiry to get to the bottom of this mess.\" The Commons Education Committee is set to start an inquiry into the GCSE grading problems next week.",

Both have denied the allegations. The charges were filed by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in 2005, but Mr Greenberg and Mr Smith have fought them, saying they have no merit. However, the Court of Appeals said there's enough evidence for the trial to proceed. Current New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he wanted to pursue the case to show \"no one, no matter how rich or powerful, can evade responsibility for misconduct.\" Mr Greenberg's lawyer, David Boies, has said he believes the lawsuit was driven by Mr Spitzer's political motivations. \"This case was brought by Eliot Spitzer expressly because he was angry at Hank Greenberg,\" Mr Boies said. The trial before Justice Charles Ramos of New York state court in Manhattan, which will take place three days a week, is expected to last for up to six months. The insurance giant almost collapsed in the 2008 financial crisis. The firm, which issued credit guarantees for sub-prime mortgages, was bailed out by the US government, which took an 80% stake in the firm and provided nearly $185bn in aid.

    "document": "He has sent a business case to Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir outlying how he intends to tackle the projected £490m overspend. The scheme was set up by former first minister Arlene Mrs Foster in 2012 when she was enterprise minister. Its aim was to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses received more in subsidies than they paid for fuel, and the scheme became heavily oversubscribed. The plan by the economy minister has now been formally submitted to the Department of Finance for approval. Mr Hamilton and Mr Ó Muilleoir held talks on the issue last week. Analysis: BBC News NI's Business Correspondent Julian O'Neill. The BBC understands the plan involves a two-staged approach. First, it would reduce the tariffs paid to around 1,800 people who got into the scheme before November 2015. This would require an Assembly vote to change the tariffs from the new financial year starting in April. Secondly, there would be a public consultation on a longer-term solution. But there remains an acceptance within the Department for the Economy that any moves on tariffs could face a legal challenge. It is understood that a significant number of RHI recipients have told the Department for the Economy they do not wish their names made public. The department had written to them asking for views on their names being released. Mrs Foster and Mr Hamilton have talked of wanting transparency about who benefited. It is believed the department is taking legal advice on its options. The failure of the political parties to find a resolution on how to investigate the failings in the scheme has led to a political crisis at Stormont. Martin McGuinness resigned on Monday as deputy first minister in protest against the botched handling of the scheme and, after Mrs Foster refused to step aside while an investigation was held. Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing agreement, Mrs Foster loses her first minister role with the departure of Mr McGuinness. The Sinn Féin MLA's decision to quit is likely to lead to a snap election. The party has seven days to nominate a new deputy first minister, but is adamant it will not replace him. If it chooses not to, then the baton would pass to Secretary of State James Brokenshire who would be legally obliged to call an election. In an effort to avert such a move, the British and Irish governments have pledged to do what they can to resolve the crisis.",

Cas had mustered two first-half scores by Greg Minikin and Oliver Holmes. But they added six more after the break through Andre Savelio, Luke Gale, who also kicked seven goals, Junior Moors, Ryan Hampshire, Minikin and Holmes. It was a debut try for forward Savelio, who only joined the Tigers on loan from St Helens on Wednesday, but Cas lost Rangi Chase with a back problem while Super League's leading try scorer winger Denny Solomona pulled out with food poisoning.. Wakefield, who lost centre Bill Tupou, second rower Jonny Molloy and loose forward Mickey Sio with injuries, managed just one score in the second half, from winger Reece Lyne, while Liam Finn failied to add to his two first-half kicks. The Tigers' storming finish, in which they scored five tries in 22 minutes, secured a fourth successive derby win to climb a place into sixth above Wakefield. Trinity drop to eighth thanks to Widnes beating fifth-placed Catalans, although they were all already guaranteed a top-eight finish ahead of the Super 8s split. But for Salford's six-point deduction, the injury-hit Wildcats would have ended up in the Qualifiers. Instead, they can now turn their attention to next Saturday's Challenge Cup semi-final against Warrington at Leigh Sports Village  - and their bid to reach a first Wembley final for 37 years. Wakefield coach Chris Chester:. \"We had one guy fit on the bench for the last 35 minutes and that really hurt us. We had a front-rower (David Fifita) who played 65 minutes in the middle which was a great achievement. \"It was a good even contest for 50 minutes then we get a penalty, miss touch and we give a penalty away and concede. It took it away from us. \"I'm not overly disappointed because there was bags of effort out there but we just ran out of troops, and Castleford were too good for us. \"Bill came off with a hamstring injury, Jonny Molloy has got a pectoral issue and Mickey Sio got a sternum injury so those three couldn't come back.\" Castleford coach Daryl Powell:. \"It's been an incredible effort for us over 23 rounds. 14 players couldn't play today. It's been really tough. \"So for us to end up finishing sixth is an awesome achievement. I'm really proud of the players. We'll reap the rewards in the long run from what's happened this year.\" \"We were a bit helter-skelter at times but it was really pleasing how we grabbed the game in the second half. \"Savelio did really well.

She then used her position as treasurer at the boys club to pay cheques into its account before taking the cash. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, Stewart, 48, from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, was also told to repay £27,000. The court previously heard that Stewart worked in the accounts department of Ivanhoe Cambridge UK, which sold the St Enoch Centre in 2013. Between May 2008 and January 2011 she had managers at the firm sign cheques that were supposed to be used to make legitimate payments. Stewart would then write over the payee name and insert the football team's name. The money would go to the club before Stewart took it for herself. She was caught after a bank spotted a problem with one of the cheques from Ivanhoe Cambridge and phoned her office. Stewart then immediately confessed to her superiors and a payment plan was put in place for her to repay the money. The court heard that although more than £5,000 was repaid, the plan was not completed and her house was put on the market. The house was rendered worthless due to Japanese Knotweed, and Stewart was later reported to police. Stewart appeared for sentencing on Thursday having earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of embezzling the money. The court heard that Stewart's husband had been jailed in 2003 for three-and-a-half years for drug dealing and she had resorted to theft to repay the debts that he wracked up. Imposing a community payback order, Sheriff Linda Ruxton told Stewart that her embezzlement was \"deliberate and systematic\" but she accepted the \"impact on her of her husband's criminal behaviour\".

Emergency services at the London hospital have been rated \"inadequate\". The hospital said it was \"extremely sorry\" for the problems in the unit. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in April and May. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care. The hospital has apologised to patients and says the A&E department now has five additional doctors and consultants on loan from other London trusts, a new nursing lead and new clinical director. Chief Inspector of Hospitals Sir Mike Richards said the hospital has already \"turned a corner\" since the inspection. He said: \"A new leadership team is in place in the emergency department, there are moves to appoint more senior doctors - and I note that the trust is calling on consultants from other departments within the hospital to provide the routine daily support to A and E which is so badly needed. \"There is still much more that needs to be done. We will be watching their progress very closely.\" David Burrowes, MP for Enfield Southgate, said he was left to wait for 12 hours on a trolley with a ruptured appendix in the emergency department in 2014. He said \"urgent action\" was needed. \"The important question is why the warning signals from at least two years ago were not heeded,\" he added. Tottenham MP David Lammy said the \"damning\" report is \"even worse than I feared\" and demanded answers from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He said: \"It shocks and appals me that this situation has been left for so long without an intervention from the Health Secretary, and the way that this has been covered up is nothing short of a scandal.\" During the same inspection, medical care services were rated as requiring improvement.

He the closures would deliver better value for money and release enough land across the UK to build 55,000 homes.

In 2012, Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust admitted staff negligence. At London's High Court earlier it was ruled the trust will pay a tax-free sum every year for the rest of Ayla's life. Mr Justice Warby ruled the organisation must pay an index-linked amount starting at £225,000 and rising to £290,000 when she turns 18. While admitting it was at fault, the trust had disputed the value of the claim for damages. It has been providing financial assistance to the family since 2012. Ayla, now eight, is totally immobile and dependent on being fed through a tube. The court was told she is at constant risk of hypothermia as she cannot control her body temperature. Despite her immobility, she suffers muscle spasms that leave her \"screaming inconsolably at the top of her voice for hours\". Painkillers do not stop the pain, which can only be quelled by immersion in a hydrotherapy pool. Ayla's father now works in London and the settlement includes £1.6m to buy a family home in Richmond. Further money will be needed to adapt it to Ayla's needs and install a hydrotherapy pool. The judge awarded a £295,000 lump sum for Ayla's pain, suffering and disability and he paid tribute to her parents for the \"calm and intelligent way\" they had dealt with the tragedy. Trust medical director David Walker said: \"We are very sorry for the harm caused to Ayla and the distress caused to her family as a result of the issues arising from her birth. \"The injuries she suffered are very severe and a tragedy for her and her family.

    "document": "Most incidents came during the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union battled for influence across the continent. CIA covert operations are by their very nature hard to prove definitively. But research into the agency's work, as well as revelations by former CIA employees, has thrown up several cases where the agency tried to influence events. Here are four examples:. Patrice Lumumba became the first prime minister of the newly-independent Congo in 1960, but he lasted just a few months in the job before he was overthrown and assassinated in January 1961. In 2002, former colonial power Belgium admitted responsibility for its part in the killing, however, the US has never explained its role despite long-held suspicions. US President Dwight D Eisenhower, concerned about communism, was worried about Congo following a similar path to Cuba. According to a source quoted in Death in the Congo, a book about the assassination, President Eisenhower gave \"an order for the assassination of Lumumba. There was no discussion; the [National Security Council] meeting simply moved on\". However, a CIA plan to lace Lumumba's toothpaste with poison was never carried out, Lawrence Devlin, who was a station chief in Congo at the time, told the BBC in 2000. A survey of declassified US government documents from the era notes that the CIA \"initially focussed on removing Lumumba, not only through assassination if necessary but also with an array of non-lethal undertakings\". While there is no doubt the CIA wanted him dead, the survey does not indicate direct US involvement in his eventual killing. Ghana's first President Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown in a military coup in 1966 while he was out of the country. He later suspected that the US had a role in his downfall and in a 1978 book, former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell backed this theory up. In In Search of Enemies he writes that an official sanction for the coup does not appear in CIA documents, but he writes \"the Accra station was nevertheless encouraged by headquarters to maintain contact with dissidents. \"It was given a generous budget, and maintained intimate contact with the plotters as a coup was hatched.\" He says that the CIA in Ghana got more involved and its operatives were given \"unofficial credit for the eventual coup\". A declassified US government document does show awareness of a plot to overthrow the president, but does not indicate any official backing. Another declassified document written after the coup describes Nkrumah's fall as a \"fortuitous windfall. Nkrumah was doing more to undermine our interests than any other black African\". In Angola three competing groups fought for control after independence from Portugal in 1975, with the MPLA under Agostinho Neto taking over the capital Luanda. Mr Stockwell, chief of CIA's covert operations in Angola in 1975, writes that Washington decided to oppose the MPLA, as it was seen as closer to the Soviet Union, and support the FNLA and Unita instead, even though all three had help from communist countries. The CIA then helped secretly import weapons, including 30,000 rifles, through Kinshasa in neighbouring Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr Stockwell says in a video documentary. He adds that CIA officers also trained fighters for armed combat. A declassified US government document detailing a discussion between the head of the CIA, the secretary of state and others indicates the support the CIA gave to the forces fighting the MPLA. The US continued to support Unita through much of the civil war as Cuba was backing the MPLA. Hissene Habre failed in his attempt to take power by force in Chad in 1980. But his efforts led President Goukouni Oueddei to call on help from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose soldiers successfully beat back Habre's challenge and forced him into exile. A proposed alliance between Libya and Chad began to unsettle the US especially as Gaddafi began to be seen as a supporter of anti-US activities. In Foreign Policy magazine Michael Bronner writes that the CIA director, with the secretary of state, \"coalesced around the idea of launching a covert war in partnership with Habre\". It is alleged that the US then backed Habre's overthrow of the president in 1982 and then supported him throughout his brutal rule.",

He has played 40 times in La Liga, the first five of which were for Espanyol. Bailly joined Villarreal for £4.4m in January 2015 and played in every game as Ivory Coast won the Africa Cup of Nations just weeks later. It had been thought Zlatan Ibrahimovic would be Mourinho's first signing since the Portuguese succeeded Louis van Gaal as United manager. The Sweden striker, 34, is a free agent after leaving Paris St-Germain and hinted at the weekend he would make an announcement about his future on Tuesday. But he has refused to elaborate, saying: \"There is no confirmation. Keep wondering. I am enjoying the stories.\" Bailly's reputation has soared this season, which saw him play a key role as Villarreal sealed Champions League qualification, and it's no surprise to see him make a big-money move this summer. His prime asset is his extremely impressive physical presence, with his powerful aerial ability complimenting his pace and strength in the tackle. The brave and determined 22-year-old has less than 50 league games under his belt, though, so United fans should perhaps not expect him to immediately become an automatic starter. He can sometimes concede possession in dangerous areas by making bad decisions, and he doesn't always show composure under pressure, but Bailly possesses all the physical tools and the rest should come with more experience.

They were mothers, they were fathers, and I really began to take an interest in why these individuals got involved in drug trafficking.\" One Colombian drug runner had a big impact:. \"At 14 he had a choice: go work in the emerald mines, or do something else.  So he started in the emerald mines, and it was a horrible experience. And then he was offered the chance to work as a driver for one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Cartel. He started as a driver, and ultimately rose up through the ranks. \"In countries like Colombia,  sometimes if you want to support your family - and you don't come from a wealthy family or you're not highly educated - drugs is the only path that you have to get yourself out of poverty.\" She noticed other problems back in the US at the other end of the chain:. \"[We] would prosecute money remitter houses in Queens that were sending drug money to Colombia.  We prosecuted one, we shut it down, and the next day another one opened up in the same location. Or we prosecuted very high level traffickers, either in the US or in Colombia, and once they were extradited, someone else came in to take their place. \"We've shifted the problem from Colombia to Mexico. Now all of Central America is inundated because the traffickers got sophisticated, and they're moving through Guatemala and Honduras, and those countries are turning into narco states.\" She argues the approach to drugs users is equally flawed:. \"The prison system is a disaster. There's virtually no rehabilitation. Locking up low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options is not effective, because they go to jail, they come out, they get involved with drugs again, and they go right back to it. \"I have nothing but praise for the law enforcement agents I've worked with [but] so many of them have said to me 'we're fighting a war that can't be won the way we're fighting it'. \"The war itself is at a draw. And I believe that draw will be maintained indefinitely unless there's a dramatic change in our approach to drugs and drug trafficking.\" Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria worked on the Global Commission on Drug Policy report in 2011 which called on states to decriminalise drugs. \"Our recommendation is regulation for everything. That's what Portugal did. \"If you look at the last 50 years, what has been done? In the US, 600,000 people in jail, $40bn (Â£27bn) of spending a year. The highest rates of consumption of the whole world. You have to say that it doesn't work. It's a failed policy, and public opinion knows that. \"Ten years ago it was unthinkable that the US would move massively to the legalisation of cannabis. \"That taboo has been broken. In the US, a majority of people are talking about approving legalisation of marijuana.\" He cites the example of Uruguay, the first country to legalise the marijuana trade. \"All Latin America's looking at Uruguay. It's a country that also looks how to deal with the production, with the supply of the marijuana that is in the state hands. \"I don't expect any major set back of the policy that the Uruguayans have put in place. \"From the beginning in 1961, the objective of the UN Conventions has been to live in a world free of drugs, but it's a utopia.  It's something unreachable.  It's not to recognise human nature.\" Former chief scientist in the White House Office of National Drug Policy Control David Murray insists the billions of dollars spent tackling drug traffickers and destroying coca crops were well spent:. \"A 75% reduction in the productive capacity of Colombian cocaine was achieved by strategic initiatives of supply reduction in partnership with the leadership and political will of the Colombians themselves. \"That's been a sustained achievement that then resulted in a more than 45% drop in the prevalence rate of cocaine use in the United States on the streets. \"This is a global business. As a global business they have their preferred mode of operation where they would like to be with regard to supply routes - ungoverned safe havens where they would like to be to carry out their business with maximum efficiency. \"When you push them off of that spot they will adapt but they are diminished. \"We may have an idealised world where prevention and treatment and recovery happen in a certain way and we don't have to do the hard and dirty work, but that's not the reality on the ground. \"The reality is it's a tough slog, it is a cancer and it is worth fighting. Sure it's discouraging to see drug use continue but it actually is diminished if you take a long perspective over time and we actually are making progress with regard to it.\" Professor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland has been a leading academic in the field of drugs policy for decades. \"The war on drugs was partly defined by its rhetoric. \"The need for national leaders to stand up and talk about the scourge of drugs, and signal to the population that [being tough on drugs] was a priority was an important part of the war itself. \"There's going to be less and less of that. I think there's going to be a change both in tone and substance, so the 'war on drugs' will become a less and less plausible metaphor for describing policy. I think it's going to be a public health rhetoric for the foreseeable future. \"I do believe that we have in a sense had an experiment with trying to be very aggressive about controlling drugs through use of prohibition.  And we have a sense that that did not work well. And so we're now trying to find better ways of managing the problem, and I think that's welcome. \"If you look at the number of people who are in prison for drug offences, at least in the US, that's an important indicator of the change in real policy, and those numbers are starting to go down.  Not dramatically, but they are definitely going down, and many states are making changes that are likely to accelerate that decline.\" As drug laws soften he argues the question of regulation becomes key, as happened when gambling was legalised:. \"Lottery play was always seen as a bad thing, you legalised it because you wanted to take money away from organised crime, but the result was that the state lotteries became the most aggressive promoters. The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service, Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT. Listen to the programme. Download the programme. \"You have slogans like 'Why be a mug and work when you can play the lottery and win easily?', just the kind of slogan you'd associate with the worst commercial promotion, but done by the state. \"Alcohol is still heavily promoted, and it's promoted in states that have state liquor monopolies, and we've only recently really been able to restrict smoking promotions. \"So I think there's considerable risk that even if there was a monopoly there would be promotion of marijuana, and clearly what we see in the state of Colorado where it is commercially available, it's regulated, like alcohol, what we see is very aggressive promotion, advertising. \"You cannot with a straight face say that marijuana legalisation won't lead to more marijuana dependence. \"Choose your problem. There is no solution. Use of psychoactive drugs is a social problem like a whole lot of other social problems. We manage it. And we may manage it better or worse, but the notion that we solve a problem is simplistic. We're simply managing a problem.\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT. Listen online or download the podcast.",

    "document": "The Saints boss had been linked with Rangers and Aberdeen in recent months. And the Perth club's chairman, Steve Brown, has spoken of his surprise that no other club has come in for Wright. \"I think he's worried about me coming into the last two years of my contract, that he's not going to get any compensation for me and that would panic him a bit,\" joked Wright, 53. \"I'm happy here. It is nice that you are linked with other jobs and so-called bigger clubs because that really means people realise the job you're doing here. \"That's the most important thing for me. I'm looking forward to this season, playing in Europe and doing well for St Johnstone.\" As it turned out, Pedro Caixinha took over from Mark Warburton at Ibrox and Derek McInnes has chosen to remain at Pittodrie, despite having discussions about the Sunderland vacancy, leaving Wright in charge at McDiarmid Park. In his four years at St Johnstone, and on a modest budget, he has guided them to the Scottish Cup, in 2014, and secured top-six finishes every season in the Premiership. Asked if he was surprised that his record had not led to approaches from other clubs, Wright told BBC Scotland: \"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't, but it's not something that keeps me awake at night. \"It's not something that, if I see someone else getting a job, puts me in a bad mood. It's just the way it is and all I can do is keep doing my job here. \"I'm quite happy for the chairman to come and extend my contract at St Johnstone if he wants, but by the look of his comments he'd rather sell me and get a few quid in. \"I just have a simple way of looking at things - do the job to the best of your ability, do it well and whatever will happen will happen.\" Wright has been preparing his squad at Inverclyde Sports Centre in Largs for another crack at the Europa League, their reward for finishing fourth last term. Having lost Danny Swanson to newly promoted Hibernian and now defender Tam Scobbie to Scottish Championship club Dundee United, Wright is looking to strengthen his squad. He's in the process of clinching a deal to replace Swanson in time for the European signing deadline but the Scobbie departure has been a bit of a shock and it comes at a time when fellow defender Brian Easton is being treated for a groin problem. \"There is a risk Brian may miss Europe and that certainly leaves us short in terms of a left-back,\" said the Northern Irishman. \"I wanted Thomas {Scobbie} re-signed. I know he was more than happy to stay, but something's happened that it's fallen through so I've got to deal with that. \"It's part of management, you don't always get what you want and now we've got to move on and do the best for the club. I'm now putting all my efforts in to get a left-back to be cover for losing Thomas.\" Wright drew praise for his handling of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team-mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half-time in the match with Hamilton. But the manager says that incident on 1 April was one of the toughest tests of his managerial career. \"I didn't see it and still haven't seen it because there's no footage of it, which is a miracle these days,\" he said. \"Immediately after the game, when I'm hearing what's allegedly happened, there was one thought in my head: that the two of them can go, they're out, they're sacked. \"But then it was time for calm heads and leadership from the club and myself. The lads very quickly helped the situation by admitting they were wrong, they were remorseful. \"So come the Saturday night they definitely weren't going to be sacked, but the chairman and I felt that for the image of the club we'd deal with this as severely and as quickly as we could (with a fine and reprimand). \"We were honest with the players, in terms of how we felt they had let not only themselves down, but the club and Scottish football as a whole. \"The timing of it could have derailed our season. We actually lost the game 1-0, losing a goal in the 91st minute after doing brilliantly with nine men and that was gut-wrenching for the players.\" Wright feels that by beating Hearts with a weakened squad and then Inverness in Saints' next two games, it showed the benefit of  \"having good people and a good squad\". On Monday, St Johnstone will find out who they will face in the first qualifying round of the Europa League.",

    "document": "In that time, the technology developed here has changed India immensely. Mr Modi is here to make sure it continues to do so for decades to come, but perhaps now with more benefit to those back home. His visit, which was welcomed by more than 20,000 expats on Sunday evening at a stadium reception in San Jose, comes at a time when Indian and Indian-American success in Silicon Valley is truly formidable. There's the charismatic Satya Nadella in charge at Microsoft. There's the 10-year-strong reign of Shantanu Narayen at the top of Adobe. And more recently, Sundar Pichai took over as chief executive of Google - a role many said had been years coming. Indians in California say it's the blend of temperament and competitive spirit that brings success their way. \"If an old school friend starts a company in Silicon Valley,\" one Valley-based Indian tech executive, Mohit Aron, told me, \"I'm going to start an even better one\". Mr Modi continues to ride the strong waves of support back home. A recent US think-tank study suggests 87% of Indians have \"favourable opinions\" of the leader. Outside the stadium, that enthusiasm was on full display - though not without the accompaniment of a strong protest against his government. Those not on \"Team Modi\" are angry at what they see as ignorance towards Mr Modi's past. In particular, they say he did little to prevent the killing of Muslims in the Gujarat riots in 2002. And when it comes to Digital India, Mr Modi's plans to get a billion more Indians on the internet, they say that's a front to mass surveillance. A letter, signed by more than 100 academics in Silicon Valley ahead of Mr Modi's visit, backed up this concern. They believe the positivity around his leadership, particularly in the Indian press, is more to do with aggression from the government towards its critics. Yet the support for Mr Modi in the US appeared genuine - and its his tech-savvy attitude to communicating that seems to impress people most. \"We're very proud,\" said one supporter outside the stadium. The SAP Center is in San Jose, a city that sits at the bottom of Silicon Valley, a region where Indians truly thrive. Some 26% of tech companies here are founded or run by Indians and Indian Americans. That's more than the next five immigrant groups combined. Mr Modi has come here on a mission to bring some of that success, and wealth, back to India. To do it, he needs help. Before India can even begin to think of itself as a genuinely major technology player, it needs to cover the basics. Mr Modi, effortlessly adopting Silicon Valley's obsession with buzzwords, said the country needs both highways and \"i-ways\", by which he meant fibre internet, connecting each and every Indian town and village. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Modi spent time with someone who could help, taking part in a Q&A with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. It was decidedly more A than Q, mind, as of 40,000 questions submitted to Mr Modi, only three were asked during the session. They covered the rewards of getting online, particularly when it comes to creating jobs. Mr Modi spoke of his delight at his tweets and messages to other world leaders \"going viral\". The last question, from Mr Zuckerberg, asked about Mr Modi's relationship with his mother. Pausing, Mr Modi became emotional as he told of cleaning dishes for those less fortunate. The prime minister even appeared to cry. An elderly Indian lady later told me it made her feel like he was \"just like us\". Those who see Mr Modi less favourably say that was exactly its intention, a staged display designed to build his reputation as a man of the people. The meeting at Facebook was mutually beneficial. Mr Zuckerberg, keen as ever to expand Facebook's user base and global influence, talked up the prospect of connecting a billion more Indians to the internet. In one of the most pointed exchanges in the entire session, Mr Modi said he hoped Mr Zuckerberg's motivations weren't purely about Facebook's bank balance. For Mr Modi, this entire Silicon Valley visit is a chance to put a little pressure on the tech giants. He wants India to graduate from being home to the low-end of the tech trade - call centres and cheap labour - and instead an attractive place to start a technology business. Indeed, he wants India to be a great place to start any kind of business, and reverse the trend of great minds, particularly in tech, heading to California. One parent outside the SAP Center, whose children were dressed in stunning, sparkling saris, said she believed when her girls grow up they will see moving back to India as a career aspiration - in the same way she saw the US as way to a better life.

    "document": "The raids came a day after it emerged a Frenchman was being held by police investigating the murder of three people at the Brussels Jewish Museum. Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, was arrested at a station in Marseille on Friday. Prosecutors say he has claimed responsibility for the attack and spent more than a year in Syria. Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve told Europe 1 radio on Monday: \"There are people who recruit jihadists. There are as I'm speaking arrests being made.\" \"We are acting everywhere. There will be no respite in the fight against terrorists.\" There is no suggestion of a link between the four arrests on Monday and the detention of Mr Nemmouche during a random check on a coach arriving from Amsterdam in southern France on Friday. But Mr Nemmouche is said to have had links with radical Islamists and served five years in jail in France for robbery before being released in December 2012. When he was arrested, he had with him a Kalashnikov rifle and a handgun believed to have been used in the attack, the Paris prosecutor said. He was also said to have had a white sheet emblazoned with the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, a jihadist group fighting in Syria, and a camera with a 40-second video showing the two guns and a voice recording, claiming responsibility for the killings. Speaking on French radio station RTL on Monday, the head of French Jewish association CRIF, Roger Cukierman, called for more resources to be given to the foreign intelligence service, the DGSE, to track militants returning to France from Syria. He feared \"they would become 700 time bombs when they return\", referring to the estimated number of French-born jihadists in Syria. Belgium has requested Mr Nemmouche's extradition from France and police have to decide whether to extend his detention until Thursday. Three people died when a gunman opened fire at the museum in the busy Sablon area of the Belgian capital on 24 May. They were an Israeli couple in their 50s, and a French female volunteer. A Belgian man, believed to be an employee of the museum, was critically injured.",

He encouraged the boy not to try to be tough like his attackers, saying there was \"no shame\" in reading poetry and listening to \"our favourite bands\". \"Dear Romford 15-year-old, who I'll call Ben. I don't know your name, and it's good that I don't, because I am sure you do not want to be associated with that video of the bullies savagely punching you to the ground. Bullies? They are worse than that. I was really shocked by what I saw. Loads of people were disgusted. You are just 15. Ben, something similar happened to me. I was a sensitive young teen, always trying and failing to be coolâ€¦ never athletic enough, never hip enough, a late developer, crazy hair, with uncool parents who thought church was the main event. I worshipped indie bands - Joy Division especially - in the way that sensitive souls do. I wanted to be a jock, but I was a nerd. Maybe you recognise that. One day I was at a party and spoke to a girl. Apparently she was the girlfriend of someone important. He sent his friend to beat me up. The friend said: \"Excuse me, can I tell you something?\" And because he was shorter than me I had to lean down to hear him. Having moved my head within range, he punched me as hard as you got punched. I had never been hit before. The shock was unbelievable - violence does that. I went down immediately just like you. My mates, also sensitive souls, were too scared to help. They were gutted afterwards. You feel humiliated. Your pride is hurt, your head is hurt - I had a gigantic black eye. A person can get very down over a beating. Some people think depression evolved in us as a way of keeping us safe if we lose a fight - the mind and body working together to prevent you re-entering the conflict for your own safety. It took me ages before I wasn't scared of being hit again. You look over your shoulder for a while, and you feel a primal fear. That is natural, Ben. So I watched your video and saw myself. That guy who distracted me in 1980 could be the thug who hit you from behind in 2016 - such a coward. Can I give you some advice? Don't think you have to be hard like them. I tried to be a tough teenager afterwards and closed myself off like a drum. I reacted to nothing and felt nothing. Then I got to university and found people like me who would never dream of punching someone, and my life opened up like a flower. A kind lecturer was shocked when I proudly and foolishly told him I had never read a poem. He said, \"We'll change that,\" and helped me understand the power of poetry. One day in my student room I read a poem and cried. I was alive again. Sure, I would never win a fight - I have never hit anyone in my life - but you don't need to hit people to succeed in your life. Quite the opposite. The courts will decide who assaulted you and how to punish them. In our society, what happened to you is thankfully now taken very seriously. But let me tell you something about the lads in the video. In 20 years, when you're with the person you love and hopefully in a career you have a passion for, they will still be scumbags. Their cupboards will smell of gym sweat and cheeseburgers. Each will own one suit which he wore to the funeral of a friend who died doing a wheelie on a motorway - by the way, they all wore the same baffled expression at the funeral service. They've gone from making the weather to being rained on, and they complain about it constantly. They are not something anyone wants to be with - their lives are already over. Five per cent of people are good at fighting. I'm not one and nor are you. It is very important we let the 5% fight each other. Live by the sword, die by the sword: the thug who beat me up was in hospital himself a year later after someone broke a bottle across his face. Meanwhile, you and I can read poetry and listen to our favourite bands, and if we sometimes cry, there is no shame in that. To cry is to live. The people who attacked you are the walking dead. Come into Radio 2 sometime and I'd be happy to show you around. Yours, Jeremy\"",

    "document": "Under US law, 40% of the corn harvest must be used to make biofuel, a quota which the UN says could contribute to a food crisis around the world. A drought and heatwave across the US has destroyed much of the country's corn crop, driving up prices. The US argues that producing much of its own fuel, rather than importing it, is good for the country. The latest forecasts from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggest that this year's corn yield - the amount produced per acre - will be the lowest since 1995-6. Total production will be the lowest for six years, it forecast, due to the extreme heat and dryness. As a result, the USDA is predicting further rises in prices. It now thinks farm prices for corn will average $7.50-$8.90 per bushel, a sharp rise on the $5.40-$6.40 per bushel it predicted just a month ago. By Mark MardellNorth America editor. Writing in the Financial Times, the director general of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Jose Graziano da Silva, said suspension of the quota would allow more of the crop to be diverted for food production. \"The worst drought for 50 years is inflicting huge damage on the US maize crop, with serious consequences for the overall international food supply. \"The situation reminds us that even the most advanced agricultural systems are subject to the vagaries of the weather, leading to volatility in supplies and prices, not just on domestic markets, but also internationally.\" Concerns about the impact of the dry weather in the US pushed maize prices up by 23% in July, according to the latest FAO food price index. But the US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the biofuels standard was having a positive impact on the country. \"It is impacting in a positive way the cost of gasoline in this country - some estimates put it at 25 cents to as much as $1.30 less for gas because we have a biofuel industry. \"There are jobs connected to that industry and less reliance on foreign oil. The question is: Is the market responding to concerns about supply and the answer is yes. \"Exports are down just a bit and ethanol production is down from between 10% and 30%, depending on the part of the country.\" By law, 13 billion gallons of biofuel must be produced in the US this year. The country's Renewable Fuel Standard, as the law is known, was designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on imported oil. It has long been controversial, with many blaming the quota for pushing up corn prices. The United Nations is not alone in calling for the quota to be suspended. Livestock producers in the US, worried about the cost of cattle feed, also want it scrapped and the governments of China, India and France have expressed concerns about the policy.",

But Nadia Nadim nodded Denmark level after half-time and Theresa Nielsen's late header completed the comeback. It is only Germany's third loss in the 26-year history of the competition. The Olympic champions - ranked second in the world - created plenty of chances but were also frequently opened up at the back by a Denmark side who, after a nervy start, became increasingly dangerous. The opener came courtesy of a goalkeeping error, as Stina Lykke Petersen misjudged Kerschowski's fierce shot from the edge of the area and could only parry the German's shot in to the net. After the break, Germany hesitated when they thought they had conceded a free-kick only for the referee to play an advantage that Denmark took, with Portland Thorns forward Nadim jumping well at the far post to nod in the equaliser. Plenty of openings for both sides followed as the game became stretched with the prospect of extra time looming. Another right-wing cross found Nielsen unmarked in the Germany penalty area on 83 minutes and she headed in to spark wild Danish celebrations. The result guaranteed that the tournament will have a different winner for the first time since Norway's triumph in 1993, with Germany having won the following six European Championships. Media playback is not supported on this device. The match had to be rescheduled for 11:00 BST on Sunday after torrential rain fell on Saturday night in Rotterdam.

    "document": "With a fifth successive title win all but wrapped up, the PFA Scotland Player of the Year says thoughts are now turning to defending the crown next season. \"We're fired up again for next year,\" Griffiths said. \"We've got five in-a-row and next year we'll look at making it six.\" Griffiths scooped the Player of the Year prize after a season in which he has contributed 39 goals, and is humbled to be marked out by his peers as the top player in the country in this campaign. \"As a professional footballer to be voted as the player of the year is the main one, you are playing against teams week in week out and for them to vote you the best player in the country is special,\" said the Celtic striker. \"I still have {my young player award} in the house. My mum's wanting this one, but she's not getting it.\" Griffiths' individual displays have kept Celtic's title defence on-track this season, but failure in the cup competitions and in Europe has left many fans disillusioned with the club, and questioning the direction it is heading. Failure to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League was an early-season blow, and a winless run in the Europa League did little to appease the Celtic support. Then came a League Cup semi-final defeat to Ross County and, most painfully of all, a Scottish Cup loss at the same stage to bitter rivals Rangers. These factors combined left manager Ronny Deila feeling he had no option other than to step down at the end of the current campaign. \"We were disappointing,\" admits Griffiths. \"The European campaign wasn't great and the cup defeat against Rangers - everybody said it was a disaster but you know we played one of our worst games of the season and we drew, but got beaten on penalties which we all know is just a lottery.\" \"{Players} could've been performing better, you know we've lost silly points in silly games. We were beaten twice by Aberdeen, we've drawn a couple of home games we didn't score in but we still managed to wrap up a league title and that's the most important thing.\" The list of potential candidates to succeed Deila is a long one. David Moyes, Paul Lambert, Malky Mackay, Michael O'Neill, Brendan Rodgers, Neil Lennon, Roy Keane - just some of the names that have been linked with the soon-to-be-vacant Parkhead hotseat since Deila announced he would be exiting Parkhead in the summer. Griffiths has already paid tribute to the Norwegian for coaxing out of him the best form of his career, but says a new man in the dugout represents an opportunity for every player at Celtic. \"Everybody in the changing room is going to have a clean slate,\" said the Scotland international. \"There are players in the dressing room who will be in favour and others who won't be in favour and it will be up to them to work their way back into the squad. \"I've had a good season so far but a new manager coming in will have his own ideas - hopefully I'm part of that plan.\" The football world has been captivated by the fairytale story of Leicester City defying the odds to become Premier League champions. Aberdeen did provide a challenge for the Premiership title, but the feeling among many was that Celtic, for all their shortcomings, would have too much strength in depth over the course of the season. So it has proved, and Griffiths is pleased that another Leicester-style underdog triumph has not unfolded in Scotland. \"As players we are delighted with what Leicester have achieved as it shows why football is the best sport in the world.  But we don't want any underdogs winning leagues up here, we want it to be us. \"Aberdeen may have run us close this year, but ultimately we want to be Scottish champions at the end of the year.\" Celtic can clinch the title with a point when the Dons visit Parkhead at the weekend. \"The boys are buzzing, we can't wait to go out and confirm ourselves as champions on Sunday. \"We know there's going to be a big crowd coming and we want to send the fans home happy. Hopefully it's three points, we only need one, but we know Aberdeen will come down and make it difficult for us.\" Having established himself beyond doubt as Celtic's leading forward, Griffiths' next target is to gain the same status in the Scotland team. The former Hibs striker has seven caps to his name, but has yet to establish himself in Gordon Strachan's side, more often than not finding himself behind Steven Fletcher in the pecking order. Griffiths hopes the end-of-season friendly internationals against Italy on 29 May and France on 4 June will give him a chance to prove his worth before the 2018 World Cup qualifiers kick off with a trip to Malta in September. \"I'm just happy to be back in the squad now and if I get a start I'll be buzzing, if not sit on that bench and wait my turn. \"We've got a lot of good strikers all vying for that one place. You've got to be playing well and in favour so hopefully come the World Cup qualifiers I'll be that man.\"",

Luton Crown Court heard Brian Wright, 55, of Kempston, said he was unable to see at the point of impact. He denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod said Mrs Blackburn, a lollipop lady for 20 years, had been on duty in Bedford Road as pupils were leaving school on the last day of term. She was wearing a long-sleeved high-visibility orange and yellow coat which had reflective strips and \"school crossing patrol\" written on the back. When the traffic lights turned red, she stepped out to escort a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road. Traffic travelling in the opposite direction stopped, but Mr Wright's VW Golf failed to stop and hit her at 14mph, the jury heard. Witnesses described Mrs Blackburn's head hitting the screen pillar of the windscreen before she struck the wing mirror and then the road. The married mother of three was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. She was later transferred to Bedford Hospital and is now at a residential care home for people with an acquired brain injury.

In a majority of cases there was also no evidence that victims' views were taken into account on key decisions. The CPS said its own data showed a \"markedly different\" picture to the \"small sample\" used in the report. Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate's communicating with victims report looked at the speed and quality of the CPS's communication with victims of crime. As part of its investigation, inspectors visited six of the 13 CPS areas in England and Wales, during a three-week period. They examined 162 case and complaint files and interviewed CPS staff, police and crime commissioners and partner organisations such as Citizens Advice. The Inspectorate said the CPS should be more consistent in the quality of their letters and how quickly they send them to victims, and added the CPS and police should agree on their roles in communicating case outcomes to victims to avoid sending confusing or duplicated information. They also stated the CPS should \"implement an effective process\" for notifying victim liaison units when charges are altered in a case, so that staff can inform victims. Inspectors did say the CPS was facing increased pressure due to staff cuts, and the report also highlighted that the organisation had taken steps to improve service, including drafting new guidance about speaking to witnesses at court to improve the quality of service. But the CPS criticised the small sample used in the report and said their own figures showed they had improved service. Chief crown prosecutor Martin Goldman said the CPS is \"committed to delivering a high quality service to victims and witnesses and supporting them throughout their case\". He said: \"Last year a survey showed that two-thirds of victims and three-quarters of witnesses were satisfied or very satisfied with the service they received from the CPS. \"80% of letters to victims due to reach them within one day meet the target, and this increases to 89% of letters due to reach victims within five days.\"",

    "document": "With delicious timing, Patrick Buisson - the man credited with inspiring his former boss's rightward shift on issues like national identity - has released a book of recollections concerning the seven years he served as his top aide. To no-one's surprise, given the way the pair parted company after Mr Sarkozy lost the presidency in 2012, it drips with the satisfaction of a finally requited revenge. I have known some acts of treachery in my time... but rarely like this\" In one passage, Mr Buisson claims that Nicolas Sarkozy deliberately allowed rioters from the suburbs to rampage in central Paris, the better to show off his capacity to restore order. It was in 2006, when Mr Sarkozy was at the interior ministry and his rival, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, was pushing through a labour reform hotly contested by French youth. Mr Buisson quotes Mr Sarkozy as recalling: \"We took the decision to allow gangs of blacks and Arabs to attack the young whites on the Invalides, and at the same time tipped off the photographers at Paris Match that there was likely to be serious trouble. \"We were petrified that someone might end up getting seriously hurt, but in the end it was worth it.\" At the demonstration that followed, police intervened early and Mr Sarkozy was on hand for the television cameras, \"proving how much he was in control of the situation compared with the prime minister\", writes Mr Buisson. The former adviser is scathing about Mr Sarkozy's \"narcissistic\" personality, and says his public courtship and marriage to \"trophy woman\" Carla Bruni was an excruciating embarrassment. \"Probably he thought deep down that the happy news of his love life would be a useful antidote to the prevailing gloom. Instead [the reaction] could be summed up in three words: immature, undignified, infantile.\" He is also unsparing of Carla Bruni herself, who he says \"did deep harm to [the Sarkozy] presidency\". \"The head of state... was in reality a fragile seducer subjugated by his conquests, a fake tough guy submerged in a permanent state of emotional dependency.\" In politics, Mr Buisson says Nicolas Sarkozy was always words rather than action, that he lacked guiding principles and was more interested in the short-term buzz of media approval. \"The public man... was always constrained by the private man, by his passions, his confusions, his weakness for whatever was in vogue.\" The book reveals that the aspiring president was in contact with far-right National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen between the two rounds of the 2007 election, which he won, in the hope of winning FN votes for round two. And in 2005 Mr Buisson quotes him as saying: \"The values of the far right are the values of all the French. It's just the way the FN puts them that is shocking. The French do not like over-spicy food.\" Now fully engaged in November's primary to choose the centre-right's presidential candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy has dismissed Mr Buisson's book as unworthy of notice. The two men fell out after the former president's 2012 election defeat by Francois Hollande. Two years later it was revealed that throughout the Sarkozy presidency Mr Buisson had been secretly recording conversations and meetings at the Elysee. Speaking on television at the time, Mr Sarkozy said: \"I have known some acts of treachery in my time, but rarely like this!\" Mr Buisson was convicted of invasion of privacy and ordered to pay â‚¬20,000 (Â£17,000; $22,000) in damages to Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni.  According to the former adviser, only Carla Bruni ever cashed her cheque.",

The systems, at Kentucky Methodist Hospital, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, California, are now running normally again. None of the hospitals is believed to have paid the ransom. And the cases are now being investigated by the FBI. The Kentucky Methodist Hospital had to shut down all of its desktop computers and activate a back-up system. A message on its homepage said: \"Methodist Hospital is currently working in an internal state of emergency due to a computer virus that has limited our use of electronic web-based services. \"We are currently working to resolve this issue, until then we will have limited access to web-based services and electronic communications.\" It later said no patient data or care had been affected. Fred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare Services, which owns Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, said: \"It did cause significant disruptions of our IT systems. \"However, most of the systems and the critical infrastructure has been brought back online.\" The attack comes weeks after it was revealed Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre in Los Angeles had been attacked by ransomware. In that case, it paid $17,000 to get access to files back. Kentucky Methodist Hospital information systems director Jamie Reid named the malware involved as Locky, a new bug that encrypts files, documents and images and renames them with the extension .locky. The most common way Locky gets itself on machines is via a spam email with an attached document that looks like nonsense and advises readers to enable macros \"if the data encoding is incorrect\". Once the malware is downloaded, it sends a message to desktops with instructions about how users can pay to have files unlocked. In November, a report from Intel's McAfee labs said the number of ransomware attacks was expected to grow in 2016. Security expert Brian Krebs said: \"It's a fair bet that as ransomware attacks and attackers mature, these schemes will slowly become more targeted. \"I also worry that these more deliberate attackers will take a bit more time to discern how much the data they've encrypted is really worth, and precisely how much the victim might be willing to pay to get it back.\"",

    "document": "As Abid Naseer started his cross-examination in a New York courtroom of the police officer who searched his Manchester bedroom in 2009, he commented it was nice to hear a Mancunian accent again. Six years ago, the Pakistani national had been living in the north-west English city where he plotted to kill hundreds in a bombing attack at the city centre's Arndale shopping complex during Easter weekend. Naseer, who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013, was convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al-Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device. Defending himself at his trial in New York, the 28-year-old was polite, calm and professional. He denied he was involved in any form of extremism. But, according to the police officer who headed up the British investigation into his activities, his courtroom conduct was a performance designed to con the jury. In a cafe overlooking the Brooklyn courthouse where the trial was held, Det Supt Mark Smith said Naseer was a good actor, an al-Qaeda trained terrorist and a man with a determination to kill hundreds of people. He said: \"He has had lots of time to develop his Westernised social skills, but I would say don't be fooled. Beneath that cool, relaxed exterior is a cold, calculated terrorist.\" Held in custody in the US ahead of his trial, Naseer had spent the months preparing his legal case and working out. One police officer commented that he had doubled in size since he was handcuffed and led away from a Cheetham Hill house in April 2009. Were it not for his arrest, detectives are convinced he would have gone ahead with a \"mass-casualty\" attack in Manchester city centre. Based upon intelligence gathered and the plots devised by other terrorists trained at the same al-Qaeda camp in Pakistan, police have pieced together what they believe would have happened. Emails sent from an internet café near Naseer's home had been intercepted in the weeks before his arrest. The final message led police to believe an attack was imminent. Known as the \"Hi Buddy\" email because of the way it greeted an al-Qaeda operative, it reads: \"I met with Nadia family and we both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between these dates.\" The jury was told female names, including Nadia, represented different ingredients used to make bombs. Wedding, or 'nikah', was a standard al-Qaeda code for a terror attack. Based on the Islamic calendar, investigators believed this email was referring to a planned attack during the Easter weekend in 2009. Other evidence included photos of Naseer's friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre. He claimed they were innocent pictures as they travelled around Manchester. But retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue described the images as \"hostile reconnaissance\". He said: \"That for me was the most alarming thing. To see each entrance of the Arndale Centre being photographed… that was clearly a means by which they would brief the would-be attackers as to what they would see as they made their approaches.\" Police think the first target would have been the Arndale Centre, which had been rebuilt following the IRA bomb attack on Manchester in 1996. The terrorists would have walked in carrying bombs made out of fizzy drink bottles in rucksacks or specially modified T-shirts. After the first wave of explosions, there would have been a second attack with more suicide bombers waiting in St Anne's Square for the rush of shoppers trying to escape. The target was chosen by al-Qaeda leaders because of the financial impact as well as the huge number of potential victims. According to Dr David Lowe, a retired special branch officer who now teaches law at John Moores University in Liverpool, it would have been a devastating attack. He said: \"It would have potentially been bigger than the 7/7 attack in London. It would have sent shockwaves around the world. And it would have shown that not just capital cities are targets.\" The scale of the potential disaster is something the man who led the police investigation is well aware of. Det Supt Smith said the relief he felt at the time of the arrests continued today. \"Every day since that time I've thought about this case and wondered exactly what would have happened if we didn't detain him. \"I've always been convinced that we prevented an atrocity in Manchester.\"",

    "document": "The proceedings in London will be \"the first time that undercover policing has been exposed to the rigour of public examination,\" he told a court. Helen Steel, who had a relationship with an undercover officer, said police committed \"human rights abuses\". But police said undercover officers can play an important role. Lawyers investigating allegations for the Home Office say they have uncovered more than 80 possible miscarriages of justice relating to undercover policing. Investigations revealed officers had also had relationships with women while undercover, and had used the names of dead children. Undercover: The allegations made to date. Opening proceedings at the Royal Courts of Justice, Lord Justice Pitchford said: \"It seems likely that the inquiry will expose both creditable and discreditable conduct, practice and management. \"At the conclusion of its investigation, the inquiry will report to the home secretary and make recommendations as to the deployment of undercover police officers in future.\" \"Jacqui\", who had a son with a man she thought was a fellow animal rights activist, did not discover he was an undercover police officer until 25 years after he disappeared from her life. She told the BBC the discovery was \"like an earthquake\". \"I want this inquiry to really get to the truth... and come to some conclusion about whether this money and human misery was worth it\". She wants the officers themselves to have the chance to give evidence, perhaps anonymously, \"and not have to worry about the Official Secrets Act or what's going to happen to them\". She hopes \"what happened to me... what happened to other women, will never happen again. \"There is no circumstance where having sexual relations in order to get information on a group, whatever the group is, is ever justified.\" The home secretary ordered the review after claims police spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence. Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, said more than one judge should oversee the case, or its conclusions should be left to a jury. \"You have an old saying - two heads are better than one,\" he said. \"Sometimes one person might miss something and the other one can bring them back to where they're supposed to be\". And Ms Steel said: \"These undercover policing units have committed grievous human rights abuses which are absolutely shocking in a supposedly democratic society. We want to make sure they don't happen again to anybody else, and for that to happen we need the full truth to emerge.\" Case study. \"Alison\" was a member of an independent political group in London in the 1990s when she formed a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy. They were together for five years and lived together for four. But Mark disappeared suddenly, saying he'd had a row with his mother and was depressed. \"His disappearance five years after we met was very sudden and unexpected and didn't make sense. I spent a long time trying to find out where he was and why he'd left,\" Alison told Radio 4's Today programme. She believes claims of depression were part of an \"exit strategy\" used by officers. \"I knew I had to get on with my life and I did that, but still carried on looking and searching when I could,\" she added. She later found out \"Mark\" had a wife and children. \"I've carried on with my life, I've met somebody else who I grew up with as a child which was the only reason I was able to trust them was because I knew that they were who they said they were. \"And I've been fortunate enough to have a family, but many of the women who this has happened to have not been so fortunate.\" Lord Justice Pitchford's inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice will look into police infiltration of political and social justice groups in England and Wales since 1968. The inquiry is expected to be split into three parts: establishing what happened, examining the procedures adopted by police to prevent wrongdoing, and recommendations for the future. Preliminary hearings are due to start in the autumn and the inquiry is set to last three years. The inquiry's terms of reference include:. The allegations were first widely reported in 2011 when a former undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, offered to help defend, in court, six environmental campaigners whom he had infiltrated. That trial collapsed - and later the same year, there were further revelations of undercover relationships, one of which led to a child. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent. The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary. That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into their activities. The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control. Seven key issues the inquiry will examine. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said undercover policing was an important tactic, but had to be done legally. He told BBC London: \"We, for the police, will make the case that our undercover officers are incredibly brave and they deal with some very dangerous people. \"We think this is a vital part of our toolset and if we don't have it then we don't suffer, but the public might.",

It was a dream start for us to go 2-0 up in the first period. \"It was always going to be a tough task keeping that pace up all game against a team like the Devils, who are rightfully league champions. \"But to be the first team from Dundee to make it to this weekend, it's not to be sniffed at and I'm proud of that.\" Dundee could hold their heads high after a great performance against the Devils in Saturday's semi-final, even if it was to end in a 4-2 defeat. Vinny Scarsella teed up Kevin Hart on the blue line and he fired his effort past Devils goalie Ben Bowns to open the scoring. Stars then went two up as Brett Switzer's low diagonal shot beat Bowns at his bottom right hard corner. The Devils started to claw their way back into the game six minutes into the second period as Joey Haddad found space in front of Dundee's goal to finish. The EIHL champions pulled level when Mark Louis reacted quickest to tuck in an equaliser.

    "document": "Kayleigh Haywood, from Measham in Leicestershire, was found dead last November. Stephen Beadman, 29, of George Avenue, Ibstock, admitted raping and murdering the teenager at a hearing in April. He and Luke Harlow, 27, also of George Avenue, are on trial at Nottingham Crown Court after both denied a charge of false imprisonment. Harlow had also previously pleaded guilty to sexual grooming and two counts of sexual activity with a child. Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Kayleigh went willingly to Harlow's flat in Ibstock, Leicestershire on 13 November. She believed they were in a \"secret relationship\" after chatting on Facebook for about a fortnight, the court heard, and had told her family she was staying with her best friend. Harlow - who called himself \"Luke Fun Times Harlow\" online - told the teenager she was his \"princess\" who he would \"love and treasure forever\". \"On that night Kayleigh had been given substantial amounts of alcohol and she had been sexually touched by Luke Harlow,\" said Ms Moore. \"She was underage and he knew it.  He was later to lie about that, pretending to people that she was much older.\" Ms Moore said the false imprisonment charge centred around what happened to Kayleigh between 21:00 and 03:00 BST on 14 and 15 November. Both men are alleged to have held Kayleigh against her will. The jury heard that at one point, Kayleigh had tried to escape Harlow's flat and was seen by a witness leaving the property naked from the waist down. \"What happened to her in that property to make her flee into the night?\" Ms Moore said. \"What we know is that she was chased by Mr Beadman and pinned to the ground. This was seen by somebody from their upstairs window. \"At some point, far from being this drunken, compliant girl, Kayleigh became somebody who wanted to get out of that flat.\" Ms Moore said that the witness mistook Beadman for a policeman. Beadman then took her \"off into the night, where she was raped and murdered by him\". After Beadman had been by interviewed by police for three days and directed officers to a location on the outskirts of Ibstock. Her body was then discovered in thick undergrowth near a stream. Following examinations of Harlow's phone, police discovered he had sought to groom other girls. His intention was to kidnap them, get them drunk, have sex and keep them in his flat, the jury was told. \"Kayleigh Haywood was not the only girl Luke Harlow groomed,\" Ms Moore said. \"She was the last in the line.\" He has also admitted attempting to meet two other underage girls for sexual purposes. Police from across the East Midlands helped with the hunt for the teenager after she went missing on 13 November. A passerby found Kayleigh's smashed phone on the ground in Ibstock. The last number she had dialled was the number of the friend she said she was staying with. An inquest heard she died from head and facial injuries.

Tries from Josh Bassett and Ashley Johnson put them back in touching distance at 31-21 before Sale's Will Addison delivered a vital three points. Kurtley Beale scored Wasps' third try 11 minutes from time and that made for a tense finish but Sale held firm. Wasps had been unbeaten in their past six Premiership matches but looked off the pace from early on. Conversely, Sale showed quickly they wanted to make a statement and did so through rugby league covert Solomona. His move from Castleford Tigers has attracted controversy off-the-field, but on it, his hat-trick took his try tally to seven in his first five matches - a new Premiership record. Another new face, South Africa international Willie Le Roux made his Premiership debut for Wasps and the full-back set up Beale's try after coming off the bench. But as Wasps threatened in the closing stages, Sale replacement scrum-half Peter Stringer gained a vital turnover and marshalled his pack to help run down the clock. Sale remain in 10th place, but open up a 10-point gap above Worcester, who lost to Exeter this weekend. At the other end, Wasps remain top by six points, but missed the chance to go as much as 10 points clear of Saracens and Exeter in joint-second.

As part of the prosecution's summing up, medical examiners gave graphic details of the injuries suffered by those who died in the attack. Mr Tsarnaev could face the death penalty if found guilty. Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Henry Nields testified that the youngest victim of the attacks, eight-year-old Martin Richard, received injuries to every part of his body. The testimony was illustrated by autopsy photos and the child's bloody, torn clothing. Mr Nields said one piece of shrapnel appeared to have gone straight through Richard's body. \"It would be difficult to say the precise location due to the size of the openings in the abdomen,\" he testified, according to Reuters. The defence began calling its own witnesses later on Monday. Earlier in the trial, the defence made the surprise admission that Mr Tsarnaev had participated in the attacks. But defence lawyers argue that his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, had been the driving force behind the attacks. By doing so they hope to spare their client the death penalty. Mr Tsarnaev is charged with 30 counts related to the bombings. The brothers set off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line.

    "document": "Mr Kasyanov, a former prime minister, is a high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the opposition RPR-Parnas party. Recently Mr Kadyrov called Mr Putin's critics \"enemies\" and \"traitors\". Russian opposition politicians have described the posting as a murder threat. The Chechen leader said Mr Kasyanov was seeking cash in Strasbourg for the opposition. \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it!\" he warned. Last March Mr Kadyrov spoke out on Instagram about the assassination of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. That message defended one of the Chechens charged over the shooting. A day later President Putin gave Mr Kadyrov a top award. Mr Nemtsov was among several well-known opponents of Mr Putin murdered in the past decade. Putin loyalist Kadyrov unleashed on Russian 'traitors' Ramzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally. Mr Kadyrov runs Chechnya with an iron fist - his private militia has been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and assassination. He has close ties to Mr Putin, who encouraged him to stamp out a separatist insurgency in Chechnya. Thousands of civilians died in the North Caucasus republic when Russian troops fought the rebels there in the 1990s. The new video is the latest in a series of threatening messages from Mr Kadyrov against Kremlin critics, whom he accuses of working for the West. It shows Mr Kasyanov talking to Vladimir Kara-Murza, a journalist who runs the pro-democracy opposition movement Open Russia. The movement was launched by exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The video was posted late on Sunday and has more than 16,000 \"likes\". Mr Kasyanov says he sees it as a direct death threat and will demand a criminal investigation. Ilya Yashin, who co-chairs RPR-Parnas with Mr Kasyanov, called the video \"an open threat to murder Kasyanov\". Another opposition leader, anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, echoed that view. On Facebook, Mr Navalny said (in Russian) \"there is no longer any doubt that all such statements in recent weeks and specifically this one were approved by Putin and the Kremlin, and quite probably were inspired by them too\". The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says they key question now is whether Mr Kadyrov is acting on his own initiative. One theory discussed on Russian social media is that he is being used by the Kremlin to intimidate its critics - particularly as growing economic problems raise the potential for protest. Others suggest that Mr Kadyrov is becoming a dangerous loose cannon - a regional leader who believes he is untouchable, our correspondent reports. The phrase \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it!\" is the title of a thriller that Mr Kadyrov says he has filmed, starring himself as a machine gun-toting all-action hero. Kadyrov the Instagram fan - by Stephen Ennis, BBC Monitoring:. Ramzan Kadyrov is one of Russia's most popular and controversial Instagram users. Since launching his account in 2013, he has made over 6,000 posts and amassed 1.6m followers. He promotes himself on the site as a devout Muslim and a strong leader. One recent post featured him grappling with a crocodile. This is not the first time he has used Instagram to lash out at the Russian opposition. In May 2015, hours after the premiere of an Open Russia film about him, he posted a clip of himself firing a machine gun, with the slogan \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it soon!\" The following day Open Russia co-ordinator Vladimir Kara-Murza was taken seriously ill with poisoning. Instagram has rapidly grown in popularity in Russia in recent years and at the end of 2015 had more than 10m active users.",

Since the news broke 'North Korea' has been mentioned 211,000 times on Twitter and has been among the top trending topics worldwide. So what can be done to prevent North Korea's move escalate to an international crisis? Here are some of your ideas. @martinedobor tweets there should be greater agreement on weapons:. It's saddening and worrying that North Korea says that it carried out an H-bomb test. That claim must be taken seriously by any person who cares about peace. This is a wake up call for the UN to swing into action in full force and stop North Korea's obsession with nuclear bombs. The UN should not wait until small ripples turn into huge waves before thinking of how to get to the shore. Josephat Ombuna, Nairobi, Kenya. @Jackalchachal thinks North Korea should be invited to talks:. North Korea needs to be accountable for its actions like any country. It's time for the world to have some serious dialogue with them. If you want to have nuclear weapons then you need to be trusted and must abide the rules. This would be the first big step to resolve this issue. Let's invite Kim Jong-un to the United Nations in New York and get down to business. Chris, Northfield, Vermont USA. @SouljaTroy1996 has a simple solution:. In my opinion sanctions are the way to go, if at all possible.  Unfortunately this may cause more hardship on the people of the North. War is out of the question - we are fighting enough wars in the Middle East.  I have thought deeply about this question for a while now (still am) , with China being an ally this would also be a concern for NATO.  Kim Jong-un is a loose cannon and unpredictable and that makes him a threat. Robert Anderson, Dundee, Scotland UK. I think we need to be prepared for any possible threat of them using weapons such as these. However, I don't think we should charge in and force North Korea to stop producing nuclear weapons. That is of course assuming they have been successful in making them. If we or any other countries for that matter become aggressive to them, the retaliation could be much worse. It's best to prepare for the worst but mainly ignore them. It's not like many of the countries condemning North Korea's actions have any moral high ground when they themselves are sat upon a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. It's like a child in a playground showing off their strength, if they are not challenged they won't have the opportunity to show their force in a fight. Mark, Kingswinford, West Midlands, England UK.

But the Universities and Colleges Employers Association said the walkout was \"disappointing given the very good pay offer\". Unions representing university support staff are balloting on the offer, with strike action possible in the autumn. UCU says its members have suffered a real-terms pay cut of 14.% since 2009 and complains the squeeze on staff salaries has come as university leaders enjoyed hefty increases. \"A 1.1% pay offer is an insult to hardworking staff, especially in light of the 5% pay rise vice-chancellors have enjoyed while holding down staff pay,\" said general secretary Sally Hunt. \"Industrial action which impacts on students is never taken lightly, but members feel that they have been left with no alternative. \"If the employers wish to see a swift end to this dispute, and avoid further disruption, they need to come back to the table with a much-improved offer.\" Summer exams are still running at some universities, though many have finished. A spokesman for the employers anticipated only \"minor impact and minimal student disruption\". \"Even for examinations which are still taking place at some higher education institutions, more than nine out of 10 report that a no to low impact is anticipated,\" said the spokesman. \"We would like to see the UCU consulting its members on the final offer.\" The employers say the offer is \"at, and, for some, beyond, a limit of affordability for higher education institutions and the very best offer that will be available this year\". They maintain the weighting of the offer means the worst paid university staff will get a rise of more than 5%. They say they have also offered talks on zero-hours contracts and on improving lower pay for female academics. But UCU says it rejected the 1.1% offer as it was only a marginal improvement on the original 1% on which it had balloted members. Ballots of university support staff represented by Unison and Unite are also under way on the improved offer, with both unions recommending it be rejected.

After all some of the players here have their next competitive game in just over a week. Many of them do play on crutches, others with prosthetic limbs. The sport of amputee football has been going for many years south of the border and now a charity is now trying to form a Scotland-wide league. It is holding the first amputee football Scottish Cup in Edinburgh next month. This team I am watching is linked to Partick Thistle. \"I wish, looking back, I hadn't let it stop me,\" says Brian Murray, who lost his leg to cancer at the age of 10. He says that, although as a youngster he did play on crutches with his pals, when he went to secondary school he lost confidence and began wearing his prosthetic leg all the time. His introduction to amputee football was in England, regularly travelling to Everton to get a game. It is rough at times - he broke his collarbone last year, but did not let that put him off. He describes the sport now being in Scotland as \"brilliant\". \"That's what I want to give to youngsters,\" he says. \"Don't let anyone stop you, just go for it.\" He adds that if he is still playing at the age of 47, then \"it doesn't matter what age you are\". Amputee football is played all over the world. In Turkey, for instance, there is a professional league, aired on television with 600 players. Scotland is hoping to play some friendlies against other European countries later in the year. \"Amputee football is just about getting people out and playing football,\" says Ashley Reid of the Amputee Football Association Scotland (AFAS). \"The limb difference, the amputation is not relevant at all when people are here training. It's just about playing football.\" She says she saw a clear demand for the sport in Scotland. The task now is to try to spread out across the country. In among the men on the pitch is one woman. In fact, she is the only woman playing in the amputee football league in the UK. \"All amputees are used to being the odd one out in the crowd,\" Rebecca Sellar explains. \"So coming into this as the only woman, you get on with it and over it.\" She would like to get more women involved. Rebecca says that since she started she has been welcomed into the game and on a personal level has gained fitness as well as the enjoyment of taking part in a team sport. She says: \"Our numbers are growing and the more word we can get out there to encourage people to get involved the better we can have it as a sport for Scotland.\"",

But Ms Sturgeon told STV News that any referendum would not been held in 2017. Her predecessor, Alex Salmond, has predicted a vote on independence will be held in the autumn of next year. Ms Sturgeon said: \"There is not going to be an independence referendum in 2017, I don't think there is anybody who thinks that is the case.\" She has previously said a vote on independence will be held if the Scottish government concludes it is the only way to protect Scotland's place in Europe. Ms Sturgeon has urged the UK government to negotiate a so-called soft Brexit and retain its membership of the single market. Failing that, she wants a special arrangement to allow Scotland to stay in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves. The first minister's latest comments regarding the timing of a second referendum follow her insistence at the weekend that she is not bluffing on calling a re-run of the 2014 ballot if Scotland's position is ignored. But she has also indicated that a soft Brexit could take the issue off the table in the short-term. Ms Sturgeon told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: \"We have to ask ourselves in Scotland are we happy to have the direction of our country, the kind of country we want to be, determined by a right-wing Conservative government perhaps for the next 20 years, or do we want to take control of our own future?\" \"That's the case that in those circumstances, I think, it would be right for Scotland to have the opportunity to decide.\" Asked if she was looking at a referendum \"much quicker\" than in five or 10 years' time if there was a hard Brexit, she said: \"I would think, yes. But let me not get away from this point, I'm putting to Theresa May a compromise solution.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said ruling out an independence referendum this year was an \"empty gesture\" by Ms Sturgeon. Accusing the first minister of \"leaving Scotland in limbo\", Ms Davidson added: \"If she's serious about allowing Scotland to move on from constitutional navel-gazing, she should ditch her draft referendum bill immediately.\" Scottish Labour deputy leader Alex Rowley said: \"While it is welcome that Nicola Sturgeon has ruled out another independence referendum in 2017, this doesn't come close to ending the uncertainty. \"The first minister should rule out forcing another independence referendum on the people of Scotland altogether, not just for the next twelve months.\" But the Scottish Greens welcomed the Scottish government' commitment to keeping a second referendum on the table. Co-convenor Patrick Harvie said: \"This cannot be a quiet time ahead for supporters of independence; although the Brexit negotiations will take two years, work must begin now to build support and strengthen our case.\"",

    "document": "PM Viktor Orban said Hungary would not allow migrants to leave its territory without registering. His comments came as Hungarian authorities opened the main rail station in Budapest to hundreds of migrants after a two-day stand-off. One train left, but then stopped near a migrant reception centre. Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan resisted efforts by police to get them off the train at Bicske, about 40km (25 miles) west of Budapest. Some were banging on the windows and shouting \"Germany, Germany.\" Follow our live updates. EU rules place responsibility for assessing asylum claims on the country where a migrant first arrives. Many of the migrants currently in Hungary have been refusing to register there, in order to continue their journeys to Germany before seeking asylum. Nothing illustrates how difficult this crisis is to resolve than what has happened to these several hundred refugees who are currently on this train at Bicske. They jumped on the train after waiting at Budapest station for three hours. They were really tightly crammed in - women and babies. They were told no international trains would leave. but eventually they were told this train would leave and they believed and hoped it would take them close enough to the Austrian border to get across. There were some police on board. We got as far as Bickse and when the train pulled in, there were loads of police waiting for them on the platform. The plan seemed to be to remove them, to take them to a centre where they would be properly identified. Some people left the first carriage, but almost immediately there was resistance, a lot of people were banging on the windows, some were shouting \"Germany! Germany!\" The police put on riot gear. And then there was one really distressing scene involving a woman who was carrying a baby by the railway tracks shouting \"help! help!\" There was a struggle involving one of her companions and riot police. This incensed some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train, they began pushing and jostling and there was a little bit of fighting with the riot police. And then they forced their way back on the train, which is where we are at the moment with police on the platform with several hundred refugees on the train in sweltering conditions. International services from Budapest's Keleti station were suspended indefinitely. There have been days of tension at the station. The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels this year. Germany expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this year - four times last year's total. The surge in numbers has created tension and disagreement over EU migration policy. Germany has been prepared to accept large numbers of asylum seekers, but other countries have not. Mr Orban, who heads the anti-immigration Fidesz party and was in Brussels for talks, said Hungarians and other Europeans were \"full of fear\" because \"they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation\". During a tense press conference with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, the Hungarian leader said that \"nobody would like to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia nor Poland nor Estonia. \"All of them would like to go to Germany,\" he said. \"Our job is only to register them.\" Mr Schulz countered: \"What we are seeing for the time being is egoism instead of common European sense. \"To say 'yeah, you know we have refugees all over in Europe but they all want to go to Germany and therefore we are not concerned' is effective, but wrong. And therefore I think we need a fair and just distribution.\" European Council president Donald Tusk said on Thursday that EU countries should accept at least 100,000 asylum seekers between them, a sharp increase on a previous European Commission target of 40,000. EU states instead so far committed to sharing some 32,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece. Mr Tusk also took Mr Orban to task for comments in which the Hungarian leader said his country was being \"overrun\" with refugees who threatened to undermine Europe's Christian roots. He said: \"Referring to Christianity in a public debate on migration must mean in the first place the readiness to show solidarity and sacrifice.\" The human cost of the crisis was also put into sharp focus on Wednesday when five children were among 12 migrants who drowned in Turkish waters while trying to reach Greece. Images of the washed-up body of a three-year-old boy, who died alongside his mother and five-year-old brother, circulated widely on social media. Czech unease at migrant numbering.

A refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who \"owing to a well-founded fear\" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and \"unable\" or \"unwilling\" to seek the protection of that country. To gain the status, one has to go through the legal process of claiming asylum.

    "document": "Mr Pistorius says he mistakenly shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through the door, believing she was a burglar, then broke it down with the bat. The prosecution says he tried to beat down the door and then fired the gun. Mr Pistorius denies intentionally killing Ms Steenkamp in February 2013. Forensic expert Police Colonel Johan Vermeulen also said he thought Mr Pistorius had hit the door with the bat from a low angle, indicating he was not wearing his prosthetic legs at the time. By Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Pretoria. A big day in the Oscar Pistorius murder case. The defence worked tirelessly to disprove a finding by Colonel Johan Vermeulen, a decorated forensic expert in the South African Police Service (SAPS). Oscar Pistorius's toilet door stood obtrusively in the courtroom, held up by a white frame, behind it a toilet cubicle. Col Vermeulen, a state witness, told the court that based on the marks on the door and their level Mr Pistorius was on his stumps when he struck the door with a cricket bat. The defence strongly challenged his version, adding that they will present their own expert witness who will prove Mr Pistorius was in fact wearing his prosthetics. Defence lawyer Barry Roux also introduced another dimension to the case, suggesting that the police recklessly handled the crime scene - he pointed to police shoe prints on the door. The forensics from the scene are a make or break for either side. Mr Roux's plan seems to include discrediting the integrity of the evidence collection process. He has already hinted at the possible contamination of the crime scene, placing the SAPS under a rather embarrassing spotlight. This contradicts the athlete's claim that he had been wearing his artificial limbs. Correspondents say whether or not the athlete was on his prosthetic limbs is important because it could match parts of his story that he accidentally shot Ms Steenkamp, or expose inconsistencies in it. The damaged toilet door, with four bullet holes, was examined in the courtroom along with a replica of the toilet cubicle. Forensic evidence on the location from which shots were fired, how they were grouped and their trajectory were presented to the court on Wednesday. Cross-examining, Mr Pistorius' defence team asked forensic expert Col Vermeulen to kneel and lift his feet, which caused him to wobble. The defence team claimed that Mr Pistorius therefore would not have been able to balance on his stumps and break down the door using a cricket bat. Defence lawyer Barry Roux also alleged that police had contaminated the crime scene by stepping on the door. Col Vermeulen argued that if Mr Pistorius was balanced enough to fire a gun, he could also break down a door with a bat. The forensics expert argued that the angle and location of the marks on the door suggested that they had been caused by someone much shorter than him. The defence team argued that a mark on the bottom of the door showed where Mr Pistorius had tried to kick open the door using his prosthetic legs. Col Vermeulen agreed that this was possible. \"The marks on the door are actually consistent with him not having his legs on and I suspect they must be similar to the height that he was when he fired the shots,\" he told the court. The prosecution argues that Mr Pistorius hit the door with the cricket bat before the shots were fired, but the defence claims it was the other way round. The trial is now halfway through its second week. Earlier on Wednesday, a friend of Mr Pistorius claimed that the star had driven at 200 km/h (124mph) and that he had taken a picture of the speedometer to prove it. The defence team alleged that Darren Fresco was himself driving at the time and had therefore fabricated evidence. On Tuesday, Mr Pistorius' defence team questioned a pathologist's finding that his girlfriend had eaten less than two hours before he killed her. This contradicts the athlete's account that the pair had been in bed for several hours before the shooting. The state is seeking to convince the court that Mr Pistorius and Ms Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, and reality TV star, had an argument before the athlete fired the shots that killed her. There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors. If found guilty, the 27-year-old, a national sporting hero dubbed the \"blade runner\", could face life imprisonment.",

The discovery was made as part of an investigation into claims by a local historian that up to 800 babies and young children died at the home and were buried in unmarked graves. Amnesty International has said that archaeological surveys should be carried out at all former mother-and-baby homes in Northern Ireland. Archbishop Martin said many in the church and society were \"ashamed\" of what had emerged at the home in Tuam. He added that \"families are owed an apology\" and that the Church had repeated an apology it made in 2014 when the claims \"first came to light\". \"It makes me feel awful. I feel incredibly sad in recent days. We as a Church do not want to repeat the awful mistakes of the past.\" He added: \"It's an appalling time for us and everyone in society. \"We're opening up a whole chapter in the society in Ireland and the rest of the world where there was a terrible stigma against unwed mothers. \"There was a terrible time, we in society and in the Church isolated and stigmatised them.\" Meanwhile, the Irish children's minister Katherine Zappone has said that 474 \"unclaimed infant remains\" from mother-and-baby homes were transferred to medical schools between 1940 and 1965. Irish national broadcaster RTÃ‰ made claims about the transfer of remains in a 2011 documentary. Ms Zappone told the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) that the transfer of remains was \"part of a tapestry of oppression, abuse and systematic human rights violations that took place all over this country for decades\". She also said an interim report into the home in Tuam would be published by the end of March, a move Archbishop Martin said the Catholic Church supported.",

    "document": "Have the media lost interest? Is it a question of chronic political fatigue? Are our brains simply not wired to think long-term? The BBC World Service's The Inquiry hears from four expert witnesses. Max Boykoff founded the Media Climate Change Observatory a decade ago. \"We monitor 50 sources around the world across 25 countries on six continents. We seek to put our fingers on the pulse of the ebbs and flows of coverage of climate change over time, month to month. \"It's not an exhaustive reading of all media accounts everywhere around the globe across all platforms, but rather is a way to get us talking productively. \"In 2004 there were relatively low levels of coverage. Around 2006, into 2007 there was an uptick. There was a high water mark in 2009 [at the time of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]. \"From that high water mark to 2014, coverage has dropped: 36% globally; 26% in the US; and as much as 55% in the UK. \"Within the last year here in the United States, National Public Radio reduced its environment reporting team from three to one reporter. \"We see examples of this unfolding quite regularly. There's certainly newsroom pressures. There's shrinking time to deadline, there's reduced resources to cover complex issues such as climate change that require a certain level of investigation, a certain level of familiarity with the contours and the nuances of the topics.\" Jennifer Morgan is the Global Director of the climate change programme at the World Resources Institute. \"Copenhagen was supposed to be the moment when over 190 countries came together and agreed a new legally binding agreement to address climate change. It was very much a great excitement and anticipation of trying to finally get a global agreement after the Kyoto years. \"I remember walking in with a colleague of mine, and saying 'Okay, we have to do it.  We have to get this done, these moments don't happen very often'. \"But it soon became clear that negotiations weren't going to plan:. \"In the middle of the second week normally what happens is the options start to get narrowed down, and you can see the package emerging. That wasn't happening, and that's when we all started to get very concerned.\" China's chief negotiator was barred by security for the first few days, sessions were routinely suspended in the name of finishing on time, developing countries said they were ignored, and the EU was missing from a final meeting where a last-minute, non-binding deal was drawn up. \"It was terrible. [We felt] an exhausted defeat, just a deep fatigue, particularly from the European side, of just wanting to take a break. The personal sacrifice - it sounds crazy - but believing and trying to make something happen, I think it was a trauma, just to put so much blood, sweat and tears into it. \"Right after Copenhagen, there was a sense that there needed to be a bit of a time out on the world leaders' side of things. So it definitely went into a very low level of attention for a few years. The relationships of some of the Heads of State after Copenhagen were quite strained. \"Even months after, it was almost like [they] had been being psychologically burned by this. \"That's had a real impact on the willingness of these individuals to stay engaged.\" Environmental psychologist Robert Gifford researches why even those who accept a link between human behaviour and climate change are reluctant to act. \"Our brain physically hasn't developed much for about 30,000 years. At that time we were mostly wandering around on the Savannah, and our main concerns were very immediate: feeding ourselves right now, worrying about anybody who might try to take our territory. There was very little thinking about what might happen in five years, 10 years, or 100km away. \"We still have this same brain. Obviously we're capable of planning, but the kind of default is to stick into the here and now, which is not very good for thinking about climate change, which is a problem that, for many people, is more in the future and farther away, or at least we think it is. \"[And] as any advertiser knows, if you don't change your message people will just tune out. And so environmental numbness is 'yes, I've heard that message before'. We're always open to new messages, and paying more attention to new messages. So if governments or policymakers repeat the same message too often, people just tune out after a while.\" We also tend to tune out when we feel helpless:. The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT. Listen to the programme. Download the programme. \"'What can I do about this global problem? I'm just one person, and there's 7+ billion people on the planet. I just don't have much control over this, so therefore I'm not going to do much about it, because my contribution, even if I did everything, wouldn't make much difference.' \"Most of us who are trying to do something about this have realised, for example, that the polar bear metaphor is not a great one. Yes, we have some sympathy for this poor polar bear, but it's not close enough to our own lives. \"Uncertainty is a really big problem. We've learned in my own laboratory from experimental evidence that when people feel a bit uncertain about an environmental problem - if the future temperature might vary from a half a degree increase to a one and a half degrees increase - people will say 'well, it's probably only going to be a half a degree increase, so I'll keep flying to some tropical place'. \"It's a natural human tendency to interpret information in a way that suits our personal interests. Joe Smith teaches geography at the Open University and argues the narrative around climate science must evolve. \"I'm not sure that people need to engage with climate change at all. It's more or less unreportable if you just describe it on the page.  It's complex, interdisciplinary, the findings drip out over time, and the boundary between science and policy and politics is a very messy one. It's a real challenge for the media. \"The idea that we will mobilise any more people with fear messaging is wrong.  I think we've knocked at the door of everyone that might respond to such a thing, but you've also got to ask whether it's an accurate way of telling the science.  I think it is more respectful to the nature of the science to say that it's one of humanity's most ambitious questions. \"There was a tactical wrong turning in suggesting that by insisting that the debate is over, we can move onto the action. It somehow implied that the science was complete, and that, of course, left lots of space for those people who have arguments about the actions on climate change to stand in the way of us having a proper public conversation about those actions because they were able to pick apart minor details in the science. \"It's not just that climate science isn't finished, it's actually unfinishable. \"The rest of science - particle physics, cosmology - is allowed to be rather saucy. I would love to get to the point where we allow climate change science to simply be interesting, enchanting even, as fascinating as any area of science because it's a hugely ambitious and compelling mission. \"If you want to talk to a business person, you talk about energy security for their business or energy security for their nation.  If you want to talk to a parent at the school gate, you talk to them about the health of their child, their experience of the trip to school - wouldn't they be happier walking and cycling? \"Talking about climate change doesn't have to involve 'talking about climate change' to lead us to some really substantial actions. \"We don't need to wear a climate change t-shirt.\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT.

Vicky Cherry, 44, had been missing for 15 months when police found her body wrapped in a duvet and plastic sheeting at a house in Toronto Street, Bolton, in January. Andrew Reade, 43, admitted preventing the lawful burial of a body and perverting the course of justice. He was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court to four years and four months in jail. Miss Cherry's cause of death could not be ascertained because of heavy decomposition but a pathologist concluded she may have died as a result of strangulation, as injuries to her neck were detected. Sentencing Reade, Judge Timothy Clayson said the defendant could not be held responsible for Miss Cherry's death but what followed was \"inexcusable\". Officers had launched a \"non-body\" murder investigation because Miss Cherry, from Fulwood, Lancashire had not been seen since October 2015. Reade, of Toronto Street, Bolton, told her family they had split up and she had moved to Blackburn. However, police discovered that her unemployment benefits were still being withdrawn in Bolton. When officers arrested Reade on suspicion of murder, he claimed he had panicked upon waking to find his girlfriend dead after they had binged on a cocktail of drugs. The 43-year-old admitted hiding her body and lying to her family and police. He also admitted taking her benefits for several months after her death. In a victim statement to the court, Miss Cherry's daughter said: \"Reade has held her body in a cupboard with things on top of her like she was a piece of rubbish. \"I will never forgive Reade. Reade himself is the only person who truly knows what happened to my mother. We will be forever tormented by this.\" Nick Ross, defending, said his client, a long-standing user of Class A drugs, had exercised \"very poor judgment\" after grief and panic had set in following Miss Cherry's death. \"He wishes he could turn the clock back,\" he said. Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton said: \"Reade's deliberately deceptive and misleading actions seriously obstructed the investigation into how Vicky died and cost us valuable opportunities to investigate.\"",

EU officials have warned that Turkey's bid to join the bloc would be finished if Ankara restored the death penalty. Mr Erdogan has overseen a crackdown since the coup attempt was quashed. Thousands of police officers, military personnel and judges have been suspended or arrested. Turkey's Western allies have expressed concern and urged President Erdogan to respond in a measured way. But speaking to his supporters on Tuesday morning, the president said Turkey was \"a democratic state run by the rule of law\". He said he was ready to reinstate the death penalty if the Turkish people demanded it and parliament approved the legislation, adding: \"You cannot put aside the people's demands.\" \"Today is there no capital punishment in America? In Russia? In China? In countries around the world? Only in European Union countries is there no capital punishment,\" he said. Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2004 as part of its bid to become a member of the EU. On Monday, Mr Erdogan said suggestions that he was using the coup attempt to crack down on his political opponents were \"libel\". \"I'd like to know what a crackdown by Tayyip Erdogan looks like... It's just libel,\" he said. \"If Tayyip Erdogan was an oppressive figure, he wouldn't have won 52% of the vote at the presidential elections.\" Also on Monday, one of the coup's alleged ringleaders, the air force commander Gen Akin Ozturk, appeared in court. The general, who appeared to have several recent injuries, denied any involvement in the uprising. At least 232 people were killed and 1,400 wounded in fighting after rebel troops sealed off bridges in Istanbul, surrounding the city's Ataturk airport and stationed tanks outside the presidential palace in Ankara. Many later surrendered. Officials have blamed the unrest on the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen and the \"parallel structure\" they say he has formed to topple the government. Mr Erdogan insists the US should extradite Mr Gulen, warning that it \"should not keep such a terrorist\". US Secretary of State John Kerry has said Turkey would need to provide \"evidence, not allegations\" against Mr Gulen, who has denied any involvement in the plot. The Turkish interior ministry dismissed almost 9,000 police officers on Monday as part of a purge of officials suspected of involvement in the coup attempt. That followed the arrest of 6,000 military personnel and suspension of almost 3,000 judges over the weekend.",

In another case, an eight-month-old baby was reportedly killed while five security officers gang-raped his mother. An estimated 65,000 members of the Muslim minority community have fled to Bangladesh since violence broke out in Myanmar - also known as Burma - last October. Nearly half of those interviewed by the UN said a family member had been killed. Of 101 women interviewed, 52 said they had been raped or experienced sexual violence from the security forces. Many told investigators that members of the army or police had burned hundreds of Rohingya homes, schools, markets, shops, and mosques. Numerous testimonies \"confirmed that the army deliberately set fire to houses with families inside, and in other cases pushed Rohingyas into already burning houses\", the report states. Many victims said they were taunted as they were being beaten or raped, with the perpetrators telling them: \"What can your Allah do for you?

Visit Wales' recent year of adventure campaign encouraged to visitors to \"Find Your Epic\". The tourism body said the campaign was \"an opportunity to promote safety\". Llanberis Mountain Rescue said many of those tackling the peak were unprepared in terms of knowledge and equipment, with many needing assistance. Chairman of the team of volunteers, Rob Johnson, said \"serious consideration\" needed to be given to how the 3,560 ft (1,085m) peak was managed. He said the drive to attract tourists contributed to an \"unsustainable\" rise in callouts - from 34 in August 2015 to 43 in August 2016. The organisation relies on donations and about 1,000 volunteer hours were spent attending incidents - including an RAF helicopter crash landing. He said many of the callouts were preventable and, with the right knowledge and equipment, they could have been avoided. \"We've attended a variety of incidents this summer but the most common have been lower-leg injuries, people too tired to continue and people crag-fast on Crib Goch,\" said Mr Johnson. \"It has been a massive commitment from a small group of volunteers.\" Visit Wales, the Welsh Government's tourism team, said it encouraged visitors to participate in activities with accredited providers. A spokeswoman added: \"The year of adventure is also an opportunity to promote safety in the great outdoors. \"Mountain rescue teams do great work in helping people, but as the adventure sector continues to grow there is no doubt rescue teams will need the help of educators in minimising the risk of people needing their assistance. \"That's why we will continue to work with partners and the industry so that people can enjoy Wales and be safe.\"",

Last month, the Assembly rejected a motion calling for the introduction of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Dr Colton also said he hoped the church would one day recognise same-sex marriages in religious ceremonies. He told BBC Radio Ulster's Sunday Sequence programme that it was a very \"divisive\" debate. \"The events in society are moving very rapidly and the church is not at all up to pace with the debate,\" he said. \"I certainly support civil same sex marriage. \"I also recognise that the church of Ireland's definition of marriage is for itself and I adhere to that discipline... but that is not to say that everyone must be required to take the church of Ireland's view of marriage. \"Having said that I'm also among those in the church, and perhaps we're only a minority, albeit a significant one that long to see the day when we can have a discussion -  as we've had discussions over the years on all sorts of other issues about the nature of marriage -  with a view, ultimately, at least to the blessing of same sex couples following civil unions if not to their marriage in church as is happening in other parts of the Anglican communion.\" The Church of Ireland's LGBT affirming group, Changing Attitude Ireland, welcomed the comments. Chairman Dr Richard O'Leary said:  \"The bishop's acknowledgement of the hurt that the church has inflicted on its gay and lesbian members is greatly appreciated especially as it comes on the day we are holding services to mark the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT)\". Last month,  Stormont  rejected same-sex marriage for the third time in 18 months. Northern Ireland is now the only part of the UK which has not passed a law to introduce same-sex marriage. The first gay marriages have recently taken place in England and Wales, with Scotland due to follow later this year. Ahead of the assembly motion, the Church of Ireland restated its position on same-sex marriage, repeating what was affirmed at its general synod in 2012. \"The Church of Ireland affirms, according to our Lord's teaching, that marriage is in its purpose a union permanent and life-long, for better or worse, till death do them part, of one man with one woman, to the exclusion of all others on either side. The Church of Ireland recognises for itself and of itself, no other understanding of marriage,\" it said. Catholic bishops in Northern Ireland wrote an open letter to all MLAs urging them to reject the  motion. The letter said the motion undermined the principle of equality by applying it \"inappropriately\".",

The money has never been paid and the council is in the process of trying to get it back. Mr Mackintosh said \"due diligence was carried out\" before the loan was granted. The Conservative MP for Northampton South said he felt \"angry, frustrated and upset\" about the ongoing financial problems at the Cobblers. The club currently faces a winding-up petition from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) over £166,000. This is due to be heard on 16 November. The £10.25m loan was originally given to the club for the re-development of its Sixfields stadium. Mr Mackintosh said all decisions over the loan were taken at the borough council's cabinet and followed \"a lot of work\" by officers. He said safeguards were put in place and were now being deployed by the council to recover the money. Mr Mackintosh said: \"Clearly as leader I have to take some responsibility for what happened. \"It is very frustrating because at the same time there are other things that haven't happened at the club. \"There are serious questions to be answered.\" Club chairman David Cardoza previously told the BBC he expected the loan issue to be resolved by the end of last month.",

    "document": "But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. \"Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?\" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. \"If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,\" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. \"We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. \"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. \"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says. \"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. \"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander. \"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed. \"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers. Yet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself. Technically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US. This means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet. \"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe. Ironically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer. The craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire. \"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan. \"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" he says. After he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially. So when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge. Now, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country. But for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning. \"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander. \"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage. \"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"",

    "document": "Assistant nurse Emilie Telander, 26, cheers as one of the day patients at Svartedalen's elderly care home in Gothenburg manages to roll a six in a game of Ludo. But her smile fades as she describes her own luck running out at the end of the year, when after 23 months of six-hour shifts, she was told to go back to eight-hour days. \"I feel that I am more tired than I was before,\" she reflects, lamenting the fact that she now has less time at home to cook or read with her four-year-old daughter. \"During the trial all the staff had more energy. I could see that everybody was happy.\" Ms Telander is one of about 70 assistant nurses who had their days shortened for the experiment, the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Sweden involving a range of employers, from start-ups to nursing homes. Designed to measure well-being in a sector that's struggling to recruit enough staff to care for the country's ageing population, extra nurses were brought in to cover the lost hours. The project's independent researchers were also paid to study employees at a similar care home who continued to work regular days. Their final report is due out next month, but data released so far strongly backs Ms Telander's arguments. During the first 18 months of the trial the nurses working shorter hours logged less sick leave, reported better perceived health and boosted their productivity by organising 85% more activities for their patients, from nature walks to sing-a-longs. However, the project also faced tough criticism from those concerned that the costs outweighed the benefits. Centre-right opponents filed a motion calling on Gothenburg City Council to wrap it up prematurely last May, arguing it was unfair to continue investing taxpayers' money in a pilot that was not economically sustainable. Saved from the axe at the eleventh hour, the trial managed to stay within budget, but still cost the city about 12 million kronor (Â£1.1m; $1.3m). \"Could we do this for the entire municipality? The answer is no, it will be too expensive,\" says Daniel Bernmar, the Left Party councillor responsible for running Gothenburg's elderly care. But he argues the experiment still proved \"successful from many points of view\" by creating extra jobs for 17 nurses in the city, reducing sick pay costs and fuelling global debates about work culture. \"It's put the shortening of the work day on the agenda both for Sweden and for Europe, which is fascinating,\" he says. \"In the past 10, 15 years there's been a lot of pressure on people working longer hours and this is sort of the contrary of that.\" Yet while work-life balance is already championed across the political spectrum in Sweden, the chances of the Nordic country trimming back its standard 40-hour week remain slim. On a national level, the Left Party is the only parliamentary party in favour of shortening basic working hours, backed by just 6% of voters in Sweden's last general election. Nevertheless, a cluster of other Swedish municipalities are following in Gothenburg's footsteps, with locally funded trials targeting other groups of employees with high levels of illness and burnout, including social workers and hospital nurses. Cleaners at Skelleftea Hospital will begin an 18-month project next month. There's also been an increase in pilots in the private sector, with advertising, consulting, telecoms and technology firms among those testing the concept. Yet while some have also reported that staff appear calmer or are less likely to phone in sick, others have swiftly abandoned the idea. \"I really don't think that the six-hour day fits with an entrepreneurial world, or the start-up world,\" argues Erik Gatenholm, chief executive of Gothenburg-based bio-ink company. He is candid enough to admit he tested the method on his production staff after \"reading about the trend on Facebook\" and musing on whether it could be an innovative draw for future talent. But the firm's experiment was ditched in less than a month, after bad feedback from employees. \"I thought it would be really fun, but it felt kind of stressful,\" says Gabriel Peres, as he slots a Petri dish inside one of the 3D printers he's built for the company. \"It's a process and it takes time and when you don't have all that [much] time it kind of feels like skipping homework at school, things are always building up.\" On the other side of the country, his concerns are shared by Dr Aram Seddigh, who recently completed his doctorate at Stockholm University's Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation's shifting work patterns. \"I think the six-hour work day would be most effective in organisations - such as hospitals - where you work for six hours and then you just leave [the workplace] and go home. \"It might be less effective for organisations where the borders between work and private life are not so clear,\" he suggests. \"This kind of solution might even increase stress levels given that employees might try to fit all the work that they have been doing in eight hours into six - or if they're office workers they might take the work home.\" Back in Gothenburg, Bengt Lorentzon, the lead researcher for the Svartedalen care home project, argues that the concept of six-hour days also jars with the strong culture of flexible working promoted by many Swedish businesses. \"A lot of offices are already working almost like consultancies. There's no need for managers to have all their workers in the office at the same time, they just want to get the results and people have to deliver,\" he says. \"Compare that to the assistant nurses - they can't just leave work to go to the dentist or to the doctors or the hairdressers.\" \"So I don't think people should start with the question of whether or not to have reduced hours. \"First, it should be: what can we do to make the working environment better? And maybe different things can be better for different groups. \"It could be to do with working hours and working times, but it could be a lot of other things as well.\" Listen to Maddy Savage's report on Sweden's experiment with six-hour days on The World Tonight.",

He drove a controlled race and stayed just far enough ahead of his pursuers to maintain the lead. Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end. Button climbed up from sixth on the grid to pass Vettel at the second pit stops but was re-passed with two laps to go. However, the Englishman was promoted to second place after race stewards gave Vettel a 20-second penalty for his overtake of Button on the penultimate lap. Lewis Hamilton retired with gearbox damage after running well down the field following an early puncture. But he will not incur any penalty for a gearbox change because of his retirement. The result extends Alonso's championship lead to 34 points ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber who had a low-key race to eighth place, never showing any real pace. Alonso said: \"It was tough, not an easy race. Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and it was enough to maintain the lead. \"Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end, with Jenson putting pressure. \"But the car was feeling good on top speed and traction and that was enough to keep the lead into Turn 6, and after that overtaking is not so easy.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. The only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade. At one stage, Hamilton unlapped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted vainly to recover from his early set-back. A move which angered the double world champion. Alonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6. It led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag. The Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint. Meanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place. Vettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier. Vettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position. Button was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres. Rather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap. Vettel said: \"The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking. \"I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that.\" Button said: \"It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end. \"When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push. \"It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back. \"But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again. I've had my feeling back the last two races but the pace hasn't been there [in the car], but today it was. We're there or thereabouts at the front, still a little way to go.\" Raikkonen provided some exciting racing as he moved up from 10th on the grid. On the way, Raikkonen engaged in top-class racing with Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher and the Force Indias of Nico Hulkenberg and Paul di Resta. Schumacher finished seventh behind Sauber drivers Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Perez. Hulkenberg and Di Resta took the final points positions in ninth and 10th.",

In future a unified patent court will hear patent cases. There will be up to four divisional courts in the UK - but there were originally no plans to have one in Scotland. The Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates had urged UK ministers to step in and change the law. That has now happened, with Scotland's Court of Session being appointed as a venue for these claims, provided there is enough demand. Gill Grassie, a member of the Law Society of Scotland's intellectual property law committee said: \"We are delighted that the UK government has listened to our concerns. \"This is an important and very welcome step towards the goal that we have been aiming to achieve for the benefit of Scotland's IP rich business community. \"If we can secure the ultimate realisation of this goal sooner rather than later this will give businesses in Scotland, which rely upon patents to protect valuable technologies and innovation, assurance that they will be able to enforce and defend their rights in future in a local court. \"Thus they will be enabled to secure the benefits this will give in terms of costs savings, convenience and certainty.\" The SNP's Pete Wishart, who had campaigned for the change, said it means inventors in Scotland will no longer have to go to a more distant court in London or Europe to enforce their rights. He said: \"This is a fantastic victory for the legal establishment in Scotland.

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) says teachers need more training to help them identity and protect girls at risk. At least 66,000 girls and women in the UK are believed to be victims of FGM. Campaigners say girls are most at risk of undergoing the procedure during the long summer holidays. The ATL, at its annual conference in Manchester, passed a resolution to lobby politicians to eliminate the practice and to develop resources to advise teachers and support staff on how to tackle the problem. Proposing the motion, Helen Porter, from Berkshire, said school staff should openly discuss the issue with parents. \"Schools and education staff can help by opening discussion with parents, and scrutinising holiday requests and summer holiday plans from members of communities that practise FGM. \"They should be vigilant for the signs of FGM such as frequent toilet visits and pain whilst sitting down. Schools should publicise the NSPCC's FGM helpline to pupils, parents and staff. \"We must aim to empower girls by discussion in age-appropriate PSHE [personal, social and health education] lessons delivered by trained teachers. \"We must equally empower boys to challenge this practice. Do they want this for their sisters, daughters, girlfriends or wives?\" Ms Porter said the practice of FGM should never be described as female circumcision, as there was no medical benefit and rarely any anaesthetic used. She said the term female circumcision was \"equivalent to describing deforestation as rainforest topiary\". Ms Porter said: \"FGM is child abuse. It is a violation of a child's human rights, and according to the United Nations is a cruel, inhumane and degrading torture that should be eliminated.\" Tendai Mashapure, from Cambridgeshire, said: \"We need to commit ourselves to the creation of an enabling environment where individuals are empowered to make decisions based on the best interest of their children. \"FGM will not end only by targeting those who practise FGM, but rather by engaging with all families, focusing on youth who will be future parents and targeting the leaders who have influence over community members. \"In other words, by reducing the demand for the practice, it will eventually become obsolete.\" ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: \"Teachers have been put in a position of great responsibility. What they need now is clear guidance on how to fulfil those responsibilities. \"They need a clear system for reporting their concerns.\" Dr Bousted welcomed the letter that Education Secretary Michael Gove sent to schools last term, urging them to protect girls at risk from what he described as \"this very serious form of child abuse\".

Storm Desmond began battering parts of the UK on 5 December, depositing a record month's worth of rain on Cumbria in just one day. About 5,200 homes were flooded in Cumbria and Lancashire, while tens of thousands more lost power after an electricity sub-station in Lancaster was flooded. The storm caused an estimated insurance bill of more than Â£1.3bn. Major storms \"Abigail\", \"Frank\" and \"Gertrude\" also hit the UK last winter.

The virus has killed vast numbers of the world's bees. Scientists at Paignton Zoo are researching how the breed has survived the mite. The zoo hopes its findings will help protect colonies and encourage more bee keepers to take on the Cornish breed. Colonies of the bees have been moved to the zoo to monitor their health over the summer. The mites act as tiny incubators of one deadly form of the disease, and inject it directly into the bees' blood. Michael Bungard from the zoo said: \"It's important that zoos look in our own backyard. \"Our bee project is predominantly education, so we can get the message across about the Cornish black bees and the varroa mite.\"",

    "document": "He also suggested they should not be eligible for tax credits. It comes as a survey suggests 77% of Britons want to see immigration cut. The coalition brought in a three month ban on EU citizens getting out-of-work benefits ahead of work restrictions being lifted for Bulgarians and Romanians on 1 January. But Mr Farage, whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years, said the government should go much further. He said the cost of migrants claiming in-work welfare payments, such as child benefit, housing benefit and tax credits, had not been factored in to the government's calculations. \"We must be completely mad, as a country, to be giving people from Eastern Europe in-work benefits,\" he told BBC News. And he said lower economic growth was a price worth paying for cutting immigration. \"Even if I thought, which I don't, there was an economic benefit to mass immigration some things are more important than money, namely the shape of our society and giving our own youngsters a chance to work.\" London Mayor Boris Johnson also weighed in to the debate, suggesting the ban on EU citizens claiming benefits should be two years. Labour said it supported the government's three-month ban, which it said was \"reasonable and achievable\". Downing Street said withholding benefits from migrants for longer periods may be illegal. \"We are doing all that we can within the law,\" said a No 10 spokesman. Downing Street also confirmed ministers were examining measures to curb the ability of migrants to claim child benefit for children in their native countries. The British Social Attitudes Survey suggests more than three-quarters of Britons want to see a cut in immigration - and 56% want to see a major crackdown. Almost half of those surveyed, 47%, thought immigration was bad for the economy, and among the 31% of respondents who said it was good for the economy, half wanted to see immigration reduced anyway. The figures are revealed in a BBC Two documentary called The Truth About Immigration, to be broadcast later on Tuesday. Business Secretary Vince Cable tells the programme the government's target of cutting net migration to below 100,000 by 2015 is \"not helpful\" and will almost certainly not be achieved. Mr Cable, who has sought to distance himself from the net migration target in the past, calling it a Conservative and not a coalition policy, said politicians on all sides must be \"practical\" and accept that net migration cannot be controlled. \"It involves British people emigrating - you can't control that. It involves free movement within the European Union - in and out. It involves British people coming back from overseas who are not immigrants but are counted in the numbers,\" he says. \"Setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful. It almost certainly won't achieve the below-100,000 level the Conservatives are setting - so let's be practical about it.\" Labour said the \"gap between the government's rhetoric and reality on immigration is continuing to undermine public confidence\". Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said Mr Cable should toughen up enforcement of the minimum wage and prevent employment agencies recruiting solely from abroad. David Cameron promised to cut net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those emigrating -  from more than 250,000 a year to less than 100,000 by the next election in 2015. After some initial success, the latest figures show net migration is on the rise again, going up from 167,000 to 182,000 a year, largely because fewer Britons were emigrating to eurozone countries. Asked last month if that meant it would be impossible to meet his target, Mr Cameron said: \"'I don't accept that.\" \"If you take the whole three-year period [since the election], net immigration is down by around third.\" He said some measures the government had taken, such as closing \"bogus\" colleges and tightening up the rules on family reunion, would take time to have an impact. In Nick Robinson's documentary, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says the Labour government of which he was a prominent member \"got it wrong\" on immigration, \"and I deeply regret it\". Labour MP and former Home Secretary David Blunkett adds: \"We didn't spell out in words of one syllable what was happening, partly because of a fear of racism.\" Nigel Farage tells the programme: \"They tried to rubbish us, they tried to say that anybody that dared to talk about this subject was necessarily a bad person and racist, that was what they tried to do and actually this has been going on ever since [Enoch] Powell's speech.\" In the so-called \"rivers of blood\" speech, made in 1968, Mr Powell said Britain's immigration policy was like watching a nation \"heaping up its own funeral pyre\". He was sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet by party leader Edward Heath, who said it was \"inflammatory and liable to damage race relations\". Asked whether he thought Mr Powell had been right, Mr Farage says: \"He was right for the wrong reasons. He was wrong in the sense that he felt that black and white would find it difficult to mix, but unfortunately he's been proved to be right because the sheer numbers that have come into Britain have led to segregation.\" BBC political editor Nick Robinson says all political parties now \"promise to control\" immigration because they are \"acutely aware of the high level of public concern\" about it. In the programme, he looks back to a civil service paper published in 2001 which examined the economic and the social impact of immigration. The paper concluded that there was \"little evidence that native workers are harmed by migration\". Its author, former Cabinet Office economist Jonathan Portes, said: \"I think politicians do have to say to individuals who are negatively affected, and let's face it there will be some: 'Yes, we're doing this for the good of our country, and yes you may lose out, but ultimately we still have to do this.' \"Just as we said to the coal miners 30 years ago: 'Sorry we can get our coal a lot cheaper abroad. We can't afford to keep on propping you up.'\" The Truth About Immigration is to be broadcast on BBC Two at 21:30 GMT on Tuesday, 7 January.",

David McGoldrick almost levelled the scores soon after half-time, but his low shot was pushed on to the post by Ipswich goalkeeper Frank Fielding. Luke Freeman sealed the win with a spectacular volley from 25 yards. The victory was just a second in eight league games for City and lifted the Robins up to 11th in the table, while Town drop to 16th. Aden Flint felt he should have had a second penalty for City as he went down in the box five minutes after the first spot-kick, but referee Stuart Attwell waved away his protests. Abraham had a chance to double the lead just before the break, but the 12-goal Chelsea loanee headed over the impressive Tomlin's cross. After McGoldrick hit the post, Freeman came up with a goal of the season contender as he smashed home a left-foot volley from far outside the box into the bottom corner for his first goal at Ashton Gate. Bristol City boss Lee Johnson:. \"It was a sensational goal. It is a really difficult skill to get the ball to dip from the position Luke struck it. \"It was a really steady and professional team display, almost like an away performance. We have had to come from behind so often, but today we got ourselves in front and looked really solid. \"We haven't got what we deserved from recent games. Now we are three points off the play-offs and looking up the table again.\" Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy:. \"The difference between the teams was a penalty and a worldie. They started well, but we got to grips with that. \"We were on top when an unbelievable flying bomb hit the top corner of our net for the second goal.

The others were found guilty of crimes including bomb-making and arson. The government has accused separatist militants based in Xinjiang of carrying out a string of recent attacks. Xinjiang is the traditional home of Muslim Uighurs, who speak a distinct language and have different customs to the majority Han population elsewhere in China. Huseyin Guxur, Yusup Wherniyas and Yusup Ehmet were \"deprived of political rights for life\" because of their role in the deadly car crash on Tiananmen Square in October 2013, Xinhua said. \"They masterminded the terrorist attack,\" the news agency added. In the incident, a car rammed into bystanders on the politically important Beijing square before bursting into flames. Two tourists died, along with three of the attackers. Xinhua named some of the other men who were executed along with the Tiananmen attack perpetrators:. Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uighur Congress exile group, called the executions \"a typical case of the law serving political ends\". Chinese officials often attribute attacks in Xinjiang to Uighur separatists, accusing them of seeking to establish an independent state called East Turkestan. Beijing has recently blamed them for an attack in May at a market in Urumqi, that left at least 31 people dead. It also accused them of being behind a mass knife attack in the southern province of Yunnan in March, in which 29 were killed and more than 130 injured.

She will live on through her characters but we already miss her beyond words,\" it added. Collins was diagnosed with stage-four breast cancer six-and-a-half years ago, according to US celebrity magazine People. She told the magazine in her last interview on 14 September that she had told few people about her diagnosis other than her three daughters, and did not regret her decision. \"I did it my way, as Frank Sinatra would say,\" she said. \"I've written five books since the diagnosis, I've lived my life, I've travelled all over the world, I have not turned down book tours and no-one has ever known until now when I feel as though I should come out with it.\" She was in the UK less than a fortnight ago on a promotional tour for her latest book.

Dale Merza, 20, is charged with misdemeanour hazing after the alleged attack last October on Andrew Seely, 19, at Central Michigan University. Mr Seely, who was sleeping at the time of the incident, sought medical treatment for serous facial swelling. The accused could get 93 days in jail and a $1,000 (Â£800) fine if convicted. Mr Merza's legal representative told the Detroit Free Press his client, who was charged on Friday in Isabella County District Court, was innocent. \"This case has been blown way out of proportion by the individual's family members, who were not present and don't have any of the facts,\" lawyer Bruce Leach told the newspaper. It is an induction ritual meted out typically to new members of the US college men and women's social clubs known as fraternities and sororities, but also to military recruits. The practice can include physical violence, sexual coercion, forced alcohol consumption, or degrading and dangerous \"pranks\" such as forcing people to eat vile food mixtures or consume large amounts of water. It is illegal in most US states, amounting usually to a misdemeanour charge, unless there are serious injuries. There has been a nationwide crackdown on hazing after high-profile deaths including that of Florida A&M University drumming student Robert Champion. Why is hazing so common? Mr Seely was targeted at an off-campus fraternity house, Alpha Chi Rho, which was sanctioned in 2011 for hazing incidents. His mother, Teresa Seely, wrote about the alleged hazing in a viral Facebook post in March, saying: \"He could have been killed.\" The accounting student only told his family what had happened months afterwards. He blamed the incident for his decision to leave the college. The teenager's father, Paul Seely, told CBS News his son could have been killed if the peanut butter had entered his mouth. The Seely family said their son had made known to other members of the fraternity that he had a severe peanut allergy, for which he carries medication.

The judgement by the Strasbourg court on Thursday is binding, meaning that Lithuania, an EU member state, will have to act on it to prevent any similar violation in future. But the judges did not award Mr Paksas compensation, saying their ruling was in itself \"sufficient just satisfaction\". Lithuania was found to have violated Article Three of Protocol One (Right to free elections) in the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2004 Mr Paksas became the first European head of state in modern times to be impeached and removed from office. The former Soviet republic's constitutional court found that he had illegally arranged Lithuanian citizenship for a Russian-born businessman, Yuri Borisov. But Mr Paksas, an aerobatic pilot in Soviet times, was cleared of the charge of having leaked state secrets to Russia. After the constitutional court had backed Mr Paksas's disqualification, the Lithuanian parliament adopted a new electoral rule barring anyone from becoming an MP if they had previously been dismissed in impeachment proceedings. Mr Paksas complained that the rule had been passed deliberately to bar him from office. He also said the constitutional court had lacked impartiality and had exceeded its powers. The Strasbourg judges accepted that a breach of the constitution was \"a particularly serious matter\", but they argued that Mr Paksas's permanent and irreversible disqualification from running for election was disproportionate. In 2009 Mr Paksas was elected to the European Parliament. He sits with the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group, which seeks to defend national sovereignty and prevent the further concentration of power in Brussels.",

    "document": "Students were asked to trace Arabic calligraphy in an exercise some parents said amounted to indoctrination. Officials said the schools were closed out of an \"abundance of caution\" and there were no specific safety threats. School administrators say a different lesson will be used in the future. One week ago, students at Riverheads High School were studying the Middle East and were asked to trace a piece of Arabic calligraphy that translated to: \"There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah\". Some pupils refused the assignment and parents accused the teacher of indoctrination. Officials with the Augusta County school district were quick to point out that the study of a region's religion and language are included in geography lessons. However, anger built up and by Wednesday complaints had become so numerous that the school's doors were locked and monitored. By Friday, the messages - described as profane and hateful - had increased and the decision was made to close the schools. Officials said that no specific threats were received, but law enforcement officials and the school district board recommended the closure because they were being cautious. The lesson was intended to illustrate the complexity of the Arabic language, they said, and not meant to promote any religious system. But future classes will use a different, non-religious example of Arabic. The decision to close the schools has drawn criticism as well. \"It looks like fear wins again,\" a resident told the News Virginian newspaper. On the paper's Facebook account, locals have been debating the closure with one man saying, \"our patriot forefathers are rolling in their graves,\" and another rhetorically posting, \"how do these terrified people leave their houses every day?\"",

    "document": "For this has been the worst year on this, or indeed any other, commissioner's watch. As the league closes in on an annual revenue of £16bn ($25bn), expansion plans into Europe and specifically London, continue apace. And as Goodell tops up his bank balance with a yearly income in the region of £26m ($40m), the professional game of American Football is more popular and yet, some would argue, more contemptible than ever. Fifty NFL players were arrested in 2014 for a wide degree of offences - from Tennessee's Shonn Greene, who parked in a disabled parking bay, to Minnesota's Adrian Peterson, who was arrested over child abuse. There were five cases of domestic violence, including that of Baltimore's Ray Rice, who was filmed by hotel security punching his then fiancee - now wife - in a lift. Goodell himself became personally embroiled in the Rice case in an argument over what the NFL did or did not know. There was also a far-reaching report chaired by the former director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, which highlighted the fundamental mismanagement of the situation by league officials. And the bad news kept on coming for the embattled commissioner. Just 30 days into 2015, there have been four fresh player arrests, including two for domestic violence and one for rape. Elsewhere, it is a sorry tale:. Yet despite all this mayhem and chaos the NFL, as a product, is flourishing. The moral outrage surrounding the cases of Rice and Peterson calmed down fairly quickly and audiences flocked yet again to stadiums around the country. More than 17m attended the 256 regular season games, the highest figure since 2008, while television audiences hit record highs. Media playback is not supported on this device. While youth participation figures are down over concerns surrounding long-term brain damage caused by concussion, NFL fans are embracing the game like never before, both within the United States and globally. The annual Harris Report, which tracks the popularity of American sports, says the NFL is still number one by a huge margin - double the popularity of Major League Baseball and College Football. A report released this week by the sports market research group Repucom also makes some interesting claims, notably that:. Most of the television networks that broadcast the NFL had audiences tuning in in greater numbers than in 2013, while the figures for both Thursday and Monday Night Football were up significantly. More than 47m people watched the NFL's annual College Draft, yet not one pass was thrown or one tackle made. There were also 9.6m tweets about the event across its three days. Nielsen, who gather audience ratings in the US, reported extremely strong numbers for the very first 9.30am EST kick-off between Detroit and Atlanta in London, so much so that the NFL will repeat the experiment next season. Although some fans showed their disdain for Rice, Peterson and others arrested last year by returning their replica shirts, many still turned up wearing Rice's number 27 jersey and Peterson's number 28 long after their cases made the national press. Despite everything, the NFL remains America's game. So why the appeal in the face of growing off-field problems? Simply put, the NFL is full of great stories, exceptional games and, most importantly, great players. The college version of the game is flourishing as well. Elsewhere in America, the other two major professional leagues - the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB) - have suffered with falling television ratings and general popularity over the past few years. Baseball's lack of true star power means it has fallen out of the national conversation, arguably since 1998 and the infamous home-run record chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who have subsequently become embroiled in steroid controversies. The names of baseball's 2014 All Stars, such as Chase Utley, Nelson Cruz and Paul Goldschmidt, do not possess the same pulling power as football stars such as JJ Watt, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers or Calvin Johnson. Baseball simply is not cool anymore and the appeal for the game has become as much regional as it is national. Jonathan Mahler wrote in the New York Times recently that: \"Baseball has never been healthier\" - in terms of attendance, revenue, and, unlike the NFL and NBA, freedom from labour strife. \"So why does it feel so irrelevant?\" With each team playing 162 games a season, baseball fans tend to watch their own players in action rather than those they have no vested interest in. That is not the case for the NFL. Almost 19m watched the Dallas Cowboys take on the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football. The NBA has also suffered in the post-Michael Jordan years, with falling attendances and viewing figures. However basketball has been rescued somewhat by the LeBron James effect, while the game, with its ongoing connection with hip hop culture, continues to grow with a younger audience. Along with the phenomenon that is College Basketball's March Madness, it remains a popular sport in America, but continues to be dwarfed by the NFL. The NBA is, according to the Harris Report, America's sixth most popular sport but is struggling with the increase in popularity of soccer and a resurgence in appreciation for ice hockey. It would also be foolish to think that the NFL is the only organisation with off-field problems. Baseball continues to move from one steroid scandal to another, while the NBA has witnessed its own fair share of domestic violence, domestic assault, battery and driving under the influence cases. The NFL is a runaway success train that shows no sign of halting. And while the on-field product remains so good, the off-field issues will be nothing more than a distraction. Green Bay Packers fan Zoe Lake is representative of millions: \"Football has always been a part of my life. As a football fan and a woman, I believe the NFL needs to take a good, hard look at the way it has handled the epidemic of violence that has rocked the league and the nation. \"But recent events will not keep me from tuning in to catch my Packers. Let's not forget: It is only a small number of NFL players who have committed violent acts against women and children.\" In April's Draft, commissioner Goodell will welcome University of Oklahoma wide receiver Dorial Green Beckham into the professional ranks, potentially in the first round. Multiple drug arrests and a dismissal from the University of Missouri for allegedly forcing open an apartment door and pushing an 18-year-old woman down a flight of stairs will not stop him being given every opportunity to succeed on the field. Even if he transgresses again, it will be just another problem for America's most popular sport. But a problem it will overcome, have no doubt.",

The New York Times reported that authorities in Bahrain were increasing security following a series of explosions in the country. Ecclestone told the AFP news agency: \"There's no reason why [the race] shouldn't be [a success].\" Asked about the demonstrations, he said: \"What's happened? They're demonstrating now? I didn't know that. There's nobody demonstrating.\" The explosions in Bahrain were reported to include a gas cylinder that set a car ablaze in the financial district of the capital Manama. Ecclestone added on Tuesday: \"We don't want to see trouble. We don't want to see people arguing and fighting about things we don't understand, because we really don't understand. Some people feel it's our fault there are problems. \"Last year I spoke to the people representing the protesters and I spoke to the people we deal with.

She added that Bahrain \"will ensure appropriate security measures are taken during the F1 race and will take enough measures, as in all other countries which host such international sporting events\". The opposition and government resumed reconciliation talks in February for the first time since 2011, when protests were crushed and at least 35 people died, but little progress has been reported. Protestors have told the Reuters news agency they see an opportunity to use the race to highlight what they say are injustices still being committed against them. The 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix was postponed and later cancelled after month-long pro-democracy protests were crushed. Ecclestone said he was \"extremely sympathetic\" to the opposition in Bahrain, adding: \"Don't forget, I was the one, when we had apartheid in South Africa, who pulled the race.\" Last year's race went ahead after Ecclestone and governing body the FIA said they had been assured the kingdom was safe for F1 personnel.

    "document": "He said payments to them for their image rights were \"the most significant risk in football\" faced by HMRC. Some footballers and entertainers have income from image rights paid into offshore accounts without tax deducted. HMRC said dozens of footballers are under investigation for potential irregularities in their tax affairs. Mr Thompson told MPs that on the issue of image rights: \"I think if it was me, I would want to review this... It is quite difficult to explain to a football fan that that is the law.\" The HMRC's head of enforcement, Jennie Grainger, said that 43 players, eight agents and 12 football clubs were under investigation. Ms Granger said HMRC has a dedicated team looking at image rights, football, other sports, and the entertainment industry. She told the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC): \"Just on football itself, in the last two years, that team, and wider across HMRC, has brought in £158m in yield.\" Ms Granger said HMRC is investigating whether some claims to separate image rights earnings from earnings as players are genuine. \"Has it been properly transferred? Has it been transferred for a fair value? Should there be income coming back to the UK depending on their residency status? All of those issues can be part of this,\" she said. The officials also told the PAC that HMRC had seven criminal investigations under way and had made arrests following publication of the Panama Papers, which provided a huge amount of information about the tax affairs of wealthy individuals. The action follows the formation of an inter-agency task force six months ago, including HMRC, the FCA, the Serious Fraud Office and National Crime Agency. At the weekend, the PAC's chairwoman, Meg Hillier, said the tax affairs of football manager Jose Mourinho should be investigated by British officials, following allegations that he used offshore companies to reduce his tax bill. Mourinho is accused of moving millions of pounds of earnings to the British Virgin Islands to avoid paying tax. According to reports in the Sunday Times, Portuguese-born Mourinho, 53, placed £10m (€12m) into a Swiss account owned by a British Virgin Islands (BVI) firm, which it suggests has no employees. The newspaper also claims that Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo used bank accounts and companies in Ireland, Switzerland and New Zealand to process substantial earnings for their image rights. However, Mr Jorge Mendes - the agent for both Mourinho and ex-Manchester United player Ronaldo - denies both claims. He says both men were fully compliant with UK and Spanish tax rules. The statement added that the allegations stemmed from a cyber-attack earlier this year on some sports agents, details of which were prohibited by a Spanish court from being published. HMRC said it would not comment on named individuals, but took \"all allegations of tax evasion extremely seriously\" and \"always investigates allegations of fraud together with any intelligence provided\". The head of HMRC will appear before Ms Hillier's committee - which is responsible for overseeing government expenditure - on Friday. Manchester United said the allegations related to events before Mourinho's arrival at the club and so it would not comment.",

The Sunday Times says it has no independent evidence Bonar treated the footballers or the other sportspeople. Bonar told the Sunday Times he treated the athletes for medical reasons and not to enhance their performance. There is no suggestion the substances were illegal, but they are banned by sporting bodies. Bonar had his professional services agreement with the Omniya Clinic terminated on Friday, after it emerged he does not have a licence to practise medicine in the UK. The Football Association released a statement regarding the claims, saying: \"These are very serious allegations.

The FA urges anyone with information that may be relevant to come forward as soon as possible.\" The case is now the subject of a government investigation, following claims made by a whistleblower athlete who was banned for breaching anti-doping rules in 2014. According to the newspaper, the sportsman - who wishes to remain anonymous - approached Ukad with evidence that alleged Bonar had prescribed him performance-enhancing drugs. Ukad says it did begin an investigation into Bonar but decided he was outside of its jurisdiction as he was not governed by a sport. Ukad also decided not to pass the case to the General Medical Council (GMC) or to contact the doctor. Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead said the organisation was \"deeply concerned and shocked by the allegations\" and it would conduct an independent review into the case. World Anti-Doping Agency president Craig Reedie told BBC Radio 5 live it was \"pretty dreadful news\" and backed calls for an inquiry, but added: \"It is best to wait for Ukad to do their own investigation, then we have full knowledge of the facts to work with. \"My own guess is if they had sufficient evidence then they would have acted.\" Have you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

Another Estyn witness said more able learners' progress had been \"stifled\". Ministers agreed they needed \"to do more to push our most able students\" and were introducing changes to raise standards \"for all our young people\". The Welsh Assembly's Children, Young People and Education Committee was quizzing Estyn about its annual report, on Wednesday. Mr Rowlands said that schools focused on a performance measure which requires pupils to get five GCSEs at grade A*-C, including English or Welsh and maths. That, he said, encouraged schools to focus on the borderline between C and D grades \"and possibly not giving enough support for those who could get As and A*s\". But he said that evidence from primary schools, further education and the PISA international tests also suggested that able and talented pupils were not given enough support in the education system. \"I don't think schools and the education system more generally have done enough,\" he said. Claire Morgan, Strategic Director for Estyn, said the focus on particular performance indicators meant there is \"some gaming, [and] early entry that hasn't helped to stretch the more able\". \"I think this has stifled the progress of more able learners,\" she added.

He added: \"I want to thank all the teams that showed interest. It flatters me incredibly and pushed me to be strong.\" Force India are currently fourth in the constructors' standings. The team had always insisted they had Perez under contract for 2017 but it took some time to finalise commercial arrangements with the driver and the group of Mexican companies that sponsor both him and the team. Perez's career was hanging by a thread when he was dropped by McLaren after one season with them in 2013 but since joining Force India he has scored four podium finishes to add to the three he achieved with Sauber in 2012. In the process, he has emerged in the last couple of seasons as one of the better-regarded drivers behind the big names in the leading teams and has more than justified his place at the pinnacle of the sport, despite the fact he brings money to a team to secure his place. Both Williams and, particularly, Renault were interested in him, but he has decided that Force India is his best competitive opportunity. The team have one of the smaller budgets in F1 but have impressed in recent years for their ability to produce a competitive car. If they can maintain fourth position this season under pressure from Williams, it would be their best finish since the team were in their original guise as Jordan, who peaked with third place in 1999. Perez's decision leaves only a few loose ends to be tied up in the 2017 F1 driver market. Williams are expected to announce shortly that they are promoting Canadian novice Lance Stroll, who on Sunday won the European Formula 3 championship, to partner their current driver Valtteri Bottas. Brazilian Felipe Massa announced last month that he was retiring at the end of the season, which would leave Renault as the only major team not to have firmed up their drivers.

The team have an option to bring him back in 2018 if they want to, but the 2009 champion said at the Malaysian Grand Prix this weekend that it was \"quite possible\" he would not race in F1 again. Renault have long been expected to promote their French reserve driver Esteban Ocon into one of their cars next season, with both current drivers Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer under pressure for their seats. But Renault have not yet made their decision and are taking their time. The lack of availability of other drivers means either Magnussen or Palmer may be retained, although that is not believed to be Renault's first choice.",

    "document": "Mark King, 21, earlier admitted stabbing 37-year-old Steven Downes in the Dennistoun area of Glasgow at 01:30 on 17 January 2015. He was told he would also be supervised for three years after his release. King is already serving four-and-a-half years for another stabbing carried out in July 2015 while he was on bail. For that offence he was also ordered to be supervised in the community for two years following his release. The court heard that in the January attack, Mr Downes had been stabbed in the back, face, arm and side and had suffered a punctured lung. Judge Lord Clark highlighted the \"pattern of knife-carrying\" King was developing and told him a substantial prison term was the only appropriate sentence. King was assessed as being at \"maximum risk\" of re-offending or causing harm to the public. During his evidence, Mr Downes said he had asked King and his friends in the close to keep the noise down because his children were sleeping. King, who was armed with a knife, ran up the stairs towards him. Mr Downes said: \"I think I got stabbed when I got dragged out of my house with my jumper over my head. \"A group were kicking my door open and bottles were getting flung. \"I blacked out and ended up in the Western Infirmary suffering from a punctured lung.\" Passing sentence at the High Court in Livingston, Lord Clark told King he had been convicted of assaulting Mr Downes to his severe injury to the danger of his life and of attempting to murder him. \"You tried to force entry to Steven Downes' flat. The door was kicked open and Steven Downes was dragged out of the flat and struck on the head and stabbed,\" he said. \"He had a stab wound to his back, stab wounds to his face and arm and a stab wound to the left side resulting in a collapsed lung and bleeding into his chest cavity. \"The injury to his left arm required to be stapled, the injury to his back was life-threatening and other injuries have resulted in permanent scarring.\" He added:  \"Your repeated involvement in offences involving knives is a very serious matter. \"The report notes you are beginning to develop a pattern of knife-carrying which is assessed as representing an increased risk to local communities. \"I see no alternative to a substantial custodial sentence.\" He warned King that any breach of the licence conditions could see him taken back to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. Matt Jackson, defending, revealed his client had been convicted of assault to severe injury and danger of life, along with other offences, and was on High Court bail when he committed the crimes. Mr Jackson said King had been \"a young lad with terrific prospects\" before he turned to offending while out of work. \"Every once in a while in one's professional career one encounters an individual [whom] its baffling to understand how he's involved in and is convicted of these very serious offences.",

Avon has been in France for almost 50 years. It employs about 120 staff in Paris, supporting 11,000 representatives who visit customers in their own homes. Angry workers in France have accused Avon of keeping them in the dark for months and not acting in line with Avon's publically stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of \"open and candid communication\". Estelle Croissant, an Avon employee responsible for supporting the direct selling representatives, told the BBC that a workers' council representing Avon staff in France was challenging the company for not following the correct redundancy process. \"They have not respected all the processes according to their own rules and values,\" she said. \"We now know an administrator has been in place since May this year, but no scheme to assist the workers is yet in place.

    "document": "What did the court say? Until now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work. On Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day. The ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive. I'm a care worker who travels to different patients' homes. Am I affected? Possibly, yes. Employees who fall into the category loosely defined as \"mobile workers\" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected. Simon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category. As many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC. And some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds. I travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office. The ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says. There may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office. I have to commute two hours every day to my office. For those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the \"overwhelming majority\" in the UK. I think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours? The ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account). That could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up. It could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum. \"I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have,\" Mr Tutton said. We have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling. Here is a selection of their comments:. This is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester. I am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge. I am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon. I currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow. I am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford. I'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our \"pickup\" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset. I am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley. I'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere.

Leicester's Tom Youngs had said the proposal \"fills players with dread\". The RPA has now said a shortened two-month off-season will be \"seriously detrimental to player welfare\". Premiership Rugby has previously said the 10-month campaign will allow clubs to become \"more sophisticated\" in their management of players, with chief executive Mark McCafferty insisting player welfare remains the priority. But an RPA statement on Monday read: \"The Premiership season is already longer than comparable contact sports, including Super League, NFL and AFL. \"Extending an already arduous season from nine months to 10 has serious implications for players, given the potential increase to the game, training and psychological loads they face. \"The physical and mental strain placed on participants of professional contact sport cannot be underestimated.\" England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland will all be playing international matches in June this summer, while the British and Irish Lions are also touring New Zealand. The RPA has concerns that an extended season could overwork any players involved in future international summer tours - a worry shared by Tigers captain Youngs. \"Perhaps most worryingly is the incredible strain these proposals would place on international players,\" the statement continued. \"If the Premiership season retains its current start date, the addition of a July tour schedule will lead to an 11-month season for these players. \"This cannot be avoided unless these players start their domestic season later, which brings into question the need for the season extension.\"",

    "document": "Human Rights Watch believes Nato air strikes killed at least 72 civilians and says the organisation needs to bear responsibility where appropriate. \"We're calling for prompt, credible and thorough investigations,\" HRW's Fred Abrahams told BBC News. Nato insists it took unprecedented care to minimise civilian casualties. It argues that it cannot take responsibility because it has had no presence on the ground to confirm the deaths. Aircraft from the US, the UK and France conducted most of the 9,658 strike sorties last year, targeting forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. In March, another human rights organisation,. Amnesty International, said it had documented 55 cases. of named civilians, including 16 children and 14 women, killed in air strikes. It described Nato's failure to investigate these cases thoroughly as \"deeply disappointing\". The point of the Nato air campaign in Libya last year was to protect civilians, so how many innocent people died is still a sensitive issue, BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall reports. In its report published on Monday, HRW said it had examined in detail evidence of claims of civilian deaths from eight separate Nato strikes. In one instance, it said a first Nato bomb killed 14 people and a second bomb, moments later, killed 18 more who had rushed to help victims. What concerns Mr Abrahams, the main author of the report, is that the deaths remain unacknowledged and the families have been offered no compensation. \"Until now, Nato has taken a position of denial,\" he said. Source: Nato. \"They refuse to give information about how they died and they refuse to investigate, and it is this lack of transparency that is deeply troubling. \"I think it will lead to unnecessary civilian deaths in the future if Nato refuses to look at what went wrong and make corrections.\" Nato says it is ready to co-operate with the new Libyan authorities in assessing what further action is appropriate.

    "document": "The European Space Agency astronaut arrived at the orbiting space lab on Monday, along with two crewmates from Russia and America. But what exactly will she be doing during her time in space? The ISS gives the chance to do scientific experiments that cannot be done on Earth, as the station offers an environment of microgravity. Here we run through a few examples of the experiments on Samantha's 'to do' list... Samantha will operate a gadget called an electromagnetic levitator, which can heat metals to 2,000Â°C and then cool them very quickly. This will be a chance to see what happens to different metals when they go from liquid to solid, without the effect of the Earth's gravity. It's hoped the results will reveal more about the physics of the metals and how they work. Samantha will be testing new machine technology and how well they work in space, such as this astronaut joystick. Using a joystick in space may feel very different in space compared to on Earth. So these experiments will see how being in space might affect how well an astronaut can control a space robot or space machinery. Another thing is that equipment may need to be attached to the astronaut so it doesn't float away. The testing will also see what impact this has. Samantha will be doing lots of experiments to see how being in space affects her body. For example, she will experience 16 sunrises and sunsets every day on the International Space Station and be tested to see how this affects her body clock. Another important subject is food and energy. Experiments to see how much food an astronaut would need for a long mission will be carried out. Samantha will record what she eats and her energy levels over a period of time. Other things that will be looked at include how space affects skin and why many astronauts get headaches.",

    "document": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in \"secret\". It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella. The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed. Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was \"another of these secret trials\". He said: \"Obviously her father is terrified, as am I. We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen.\" Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK. He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome \"might come today, it might come next week\". There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was \"more fight in her\" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas. He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was \"unpredictable\" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased. Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: \"I have watched her grow up on Skype. \"She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English. \"Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing.\" Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter. Amnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a \"prisoner of conscience\" who was being held for \"peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association\". Risk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: \"Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release.\"",

Reuben Lewis from Llanidloes was driven 45 minutes from Ysgol Cedewain, Newtown, without teachers or transport staff realising he was still on board. BBC Wales understands he was then left alone on the parked bus in Rhayader on two separate occasions. Powys council said there had been a \"serious breakdown in communication\". A spokesman added it had spoken to the school and all contractors to ensure immediate safeguards were put in place to prevent any similar incidents in future. The most recent incident was on Monday, when it was only noticed Reuben was missing after his sister spotted he was not present at a school swimming lesson she was teaching at Maldwyn Leisure Centre in Newtown. Police were told and Reuben was found at the Simon Price Cars bus depot. Reuben's father, Rob Lewis, said there had been \"several mistakes\" by the school and transport provider in the past year. He said Reuben was left on the bus in May last year and left at school the following December. \"I was in total and utter shock that this had happened again,\" he said. \"I'm always happy to give someone a second chance, but now I wish I'd never given them a first chance. This beggars belief. \"It was sheer luck that it was noticed Reuben was missing on Monday because his older sister works part time as a lifeguard in the leisure centre. \"She knew her brother was meant to be at the swimming lessons and when she couldn't see him she rang her mother and we alerted the school and the police.\" Mr Lewis said he had an agreement with the school to notify them before 09:00 if Reuben would not be attending, so the alarm would be raised if he was not there. \"So how could this happen again on Monday, after we were given so many reassurances?\" he added. Simon Price, owner of Simon Price Cars, said the company was contractually unable to comment while the investigation was ongoing. A council spokesman added: \"Although we have undertaken an internal review of the circumstances surrounding this incident we have advised the parents to make a formal complaint so that we can investigate all of the circumstances in the fullest detail as a matter of urgency. \"We have apologised to the parents.\"",

    "document": "More than 100 people are still missing and feared dead after a hillside collapsed on Sunday, following the heaviest rains in the country for decades. Local residents initially used their bare hands to dig into tonnes of mud that engulfed some 30 houses. Seven people have been saved so far. Thousands of people have fled the area. The BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Medellin says many of the bodies being pulled from the mud are those of children who were playing in the streets when the landslide hit. The scar of the collapsed hillside can be seen from miles away, he adds. The landslide hit the La Gabriela district of Bello, Antioquia province, at about 1900 GMT on Sunday. In pictures: Colombia landslide. Officials originally feared that 145 people may have been buried. But the mayor of Bello, Oscar Andres Perez, told Colombian radio 123 people had been trapped. He said the hill had become increasingly saturated with water over the past few days and that there had been a \"high risk of landslides\". Mr Perez said the authorities had warned residents of the danger. Orfanely Madrigal, a Bello resident, told a local radio station she had been aware of the risk: \"I foresaw this tragedy. I told my mother this was a high-risk area but nobody believed me.\" \"I've lost half my family - my mother, four brothers, nephews and my 13- and 10-year-old daughters,\" she said. Several hundred people, including Red Cross rescue workers, soldiers and police, are digging through the deep mud in an effort to find survivors. More than 20 sniffer dogs have also been brought in. However, teams are moving cautiously for fear that heavy machinery will crush homes buried in the mud. Red Cross officials say that 174 people have died as a result of the heavy rains in Colombia, 225 have been injured and 19 are missing, without counting the victims of the Bello landslide. Tens of thousands have been left homeless after most major rivers have burst their banks as a result of the heavy rain. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has announced he is flying to Bello to personally assess the situation there. Mr Santos has said recovering from the torrential rains and the damage they have caused is going to be very expensive, and that he is considering calling a national state of emergency if the rains continue. \"Unfortunately, this tragedy has just kept growing,\" he said. Neighbouring Venezuela is also experiencing heavy flooding. Some 70,000 people have been driven from their homes there. President Hugo Chavez has said his government plans to seize private land to house some of those forced to abandon their homes. The May-November rainy season in Mexico, Central America and the northern part of South America has been severe this year. The extreme weather is attributed to the La Nina climatic phenomenon, which is caused by colder than usual water currents along the Pacific coast.",

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device. It began when he left behind a glamorous Manhattan lifestyle for the wonder and wastelands of Sierra Leone five years ago. It will end when he walks through the front door of the family home in Lisburn, Belfast for Christmas, having lived through an incredible time in modern history. Very few 29-year-olds have managed a national football team. None have done it while that country is being brought to its knees by Ebola. \"I'm very sad, very emotional,\" he said. \"Saying goodbye to Sierra Leone was very emotional, very difficult. I don't keep my distance from things; I invest emotionally. The country has become part of me.\" Having been an academy coach with the New York Red Bulls, McKinstry was appointed technical director of the Craig Bellamy academy in Sierra Leone at the age of 24. By 27, he was manager of the national team. Within 18 months his squad were in the top 50 of the world rankings for the first time. \"I've made a career of proving doubters wrong,\" he said. Two months ago he was sacked by email, as the Ebola outbreak gathered momentum. \"We believed we had the chemistry, cohesion and spirit to achieve anything. But the Ebola outbreak changed everything. Circumstances meant that, in the end, it was an impossible job.\" McKinstry stepped off a plane four hours before we met in a London hotel. He had not slept for the best part of two days. The journey to Freetown Airport had to be made by boat to avoid some of the areas worst affected by Ebola. An early flight meant crossing the night before. A night at an airport, one plane to Morocco, another to London followed by a medical check by customs officers is no ordinary preparation for an interview. But for a man who has spent much of the past six months living in lockdown, being among the bustle again is a welcome change. His time in Sierra Leone has now come to an end. The memory of it will, however, live on. \"In the last month or so when I went into Freetown for supplies, I started to see more of the Ebola response teams, with the full yellow bio-hazard suits,\" he said. \"You might see an ambulance driving past and even the driver would be in the full bio-hazard gear. \"When you see that it really does bring it home to you just how serious the situation is.\" McKinstry was offered a way out, a safe passage home in July, but refused it. Many of the players in the academy were from affected areas, he felt he had a duty of care not to walk away and send the young footballers into danger. Instead he quarantined the academy behind the gate and walls of the compound. \"When the outbreak started a lot of people ran for cover,\" he said. \"But Ebola is a disease of contact, if you remove the contact, you remove the risk. So that is what we did. We moved everyone who was off site, behind the walls. We had generators for power, bore holes for fresh water, we had dorm rooms, classrooms and a football pitch.\" In Northern Ireland his family were growing increasingly worried about the situation. Did they want him home? \"They wanted information. They wanted to know what was going on, to know that I was safe, that the boys at the academy were safe,\" he said. It is not sensationalist to suggest that the Ebola virus cost McKinstry his job as head coach. But before he explained how it came to an end, he addressed the question of how it all began. \"When it comes to football, confidence has not been something I have been lacking,\" McKinstry said with a smile. \"There is a saying in Newcastle - 'shy bearns get nowt' - if you don't ask you don't get. \"That was my attitude to the Sierra Leone job. I know I was 27 but if they said no, nothing is lost. If they said yes, it was going to be the start of an exciting new chapter.\" McKinstry had watched every Sierra Leone home game in person, every away game on TV, he had watched them train, studied their players. \"I thought I was the best man for the job,\" he added. \"I got in the room with the decision-makers and I went through Sierra Leone's last two games with a fine tooth comb and Tunisia's last two, who would be our next opponents. \"I outlined how I'd beat Tunisia, how I saw the future. Every member of the panel went away with a dossier, which I told them they could keep and use even if they didn't choose me. \"Two days later they offered me the job.\" McKinstry made an impressive start, losing just one of his first six matches and leading Sierra Leone into the top 50 of Fifa's world rankings, above Northern Ireland, the Republic, Cameroon and Senegal. Then the Ebola outbreak happened and football became a side issue. \"We looked at what little we could do as sporting heroes, could we put smiles on the faces of the nation?\" McKinstry said. \"Football is a second religion in Sierra Leone. \"So when the national team wins, the national psyche is buoyed, everyone walks an inch or two taller. We made a commitment to keep on winning to try to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations so that people in the country would feel a little bit better. Unfortunately it wasn't to work out that way.\" The Confederation of African Football ruled that Sierra Leone could not play games at home. A challenging task was becoming a near-impossible one. \"In football, the home team tends to win 50% of the time. In Africa, the home team wins 65 or 70% of the time,\" McKinstry explained. That was not the only complication. \"In my final game, against DR Congo, we had 17,000 fans just chanting 'Ebola, Ebola, Ebola' at us. It was upsetting for our players. The atmosphere was difficult. It made the players angry that people were mocking the situation in their homeland,\" he said. Sierra Leone players found opponents unwilling to shake hands, hotels unwilling to check them in and governments uncertain on granting them entry. \"People fear things they don't know,\" he said. \"Hotel arrangements were monitored wherever we went, there were daily medical checks for my players and, while that is not overly difficult, it can impact on players' mental state.\" Sierra Leone's first group game as they attempted to qualify for the African Cup of Nations was away to Ivory Coast in early September. With a week to go, McKinstry was still unsure whether he and his players would be allowed into the country. The confusion meant some players had to buy their own plane tickets. Others arrived the night before the game. Sierra Leone led for an hour, only to lose 2-1. The demands of their schedule meant the squad left at 11pm that night to fly to DR Congo for a 'home' qualifier that was to be played in the away team's stadium. That game too ended in a 2-0 defeat and was marred by chants of 'Ebola, Ebola.' McKinstry did not see the end coming. He said: \"I had been in the FA building that day and not once was anything mentioned. I was driving back home, over a mountain pass, when my phone buzzed with an email from one of the men I'd been speaking to, not two hours earlier. It said they had terminated my contract. I was disappointed. I'd been standing in their office a few hours earlier. \"But I believe in a certain way of doing things. So I spun the car around, went straight back to the FA, not to argue with them but just to go in shake hands and say 'best of luck for the future and it has been a pleasure for the past 18 months.'\" McKinstry has a voracious appetite for football and for learning, he lives and breathes it and his sense of adventure means predicting his next move is not easy. In the New Year he has a series of meetings in Asia. This is not a man who does things by the book. Having been a coach from the age of 15, McKinstry already has miles on the clock. The boyhood Newcastle United fan still dreams of taking charge at St James' Park or leading his native Northern Ireland out. \"Nothing would make me prouder, my heart would be beating out of my chest for both those opportunities at some stage in my career.\" Watch the full interview with Johnny McKinstry - Football Focus, BBC One on Saturday 20 December at 12:10 GMT.",

Brexit and Northern Ireland's political stalemate are among the challenges waiting for the new taoiseach. The leadership contest will begin on Thursday, with the new leader to be announced on 2 June after an electoral college of the parliamentary party. County councillors and party members will also have their say. While the field may widen before 2 June, the early favourites for the post are Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar and Housing Minister Simon Coveney. Born in Dublin, the 38-year-old is the son of a Mumbai-born doctor and a mother from County Waterford. He was privately educated and studied medicine at Trinity College in Dublin, qualifying as a GP before entering politics. He was elected to parliament in 2007 as a representative for Dublin West and held the tourism and health portfolios before taking on his current post last year. In an RTÉ interview in 2015, he revealed that he is gay, explaining that he wanted to be clear on the matter ahead of the Irish referendum on same-sex marriage. \"I just kind of want to be honest with people,\" he said. \"I don't want anyone to think that I have a hidden agenda.\" Mr Varadkar has courted controversy by announcing that people convicted of welfare fraud will be \"named and shamed\" on a government website. In a recent speech reported by the Irish Independent, he outlined his attitude to Brexit, saying there should be \"no economic border at all between north and south\". The son of the former Fine Gael politician Hugh Coveney, the Cork-born 44-year-old has followed his father's footsteps to a seat in the Dáil (Irish parliament). As a teenager, he was expelled from the exclusive Clongowes Wood boarding school for drinking and bunking off to attend a beach party. In a candid interview with RTÉ, he said he had suffered from a stutter, and lived in the shadow of his more promising brother, who is now a successful businessman. He went on to study management at the Royal Agricultural College in Gloucestershire, England, before his election as the youngest member of the Dáil in 1998. He was appointed as agriculture minister in 2011 and responsibility for defence was added to his portfolio three years later. He has made no secret of his desire to lead his party - when RTÉ asked the question about his intentions, he said: \"I am very ambitious, so the straight answer is yes, some day. \"But I am personally very loyal to Enda and he knows that.\"",

Does that mean... that I was seeking an emergency?\" he asked. Mr Tsipras did not directly address the reported details of the plan, which was to have allowed the government to introduce a parallel payment system if the banking system was closed down and the drachma had to be re-introduced. A small team in the governing Syriza party was charged with investigating how to secretly copy online tax codes and use them to issue new pin numbers for every taxpayer, to be used in transactions with the state. \"That would have created a parallel banking system while the banks were shut as a result of the ECB's aggressive action to deny us some breathing space,\" Mr Varoufakis said in a leaked phone conversation. Mr Varoufakis later confirmed the existence of the plan, but denied claims that he had wanted to engineer a Greek exit from the euro.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is accused of masterminding the attacks while the others are implicated for providing support for the co-ordinated hijacking. In May, a chaotic hearing in the case lasted 13 hours. During that hearing, which formally charged the five men, the defendants made defiant outbursts and refused to answer the judge's questions or use the translation system. In addition to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, defendants Ramzi Binalshibh, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Waleed bin Attash are being prosecuted in a special military tribunal for wartime offences known as a military commission. They are charged with conspiring with al-Qaeda, terrorism, and one count of murder for each known victim of the 11 September attacks at the time the charges were filed - 2,976 in total. The five face a possible death penalty sentence if convicted. CIA waterboarding tapes revealed. On Monday, the defendants listened calmly and answered the judge's questions, although Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said: \"I don't think there's any justice in this court.\" Defence lawyers argued during the hearing that their clients should not be forced to attend the rest of the week's hearings, because the forcible transport from their high-security cells may remind them of their time at secret CIA prisons. Before their transfer to the US base at Guantanamo Bay in 2006, the defendants were held for years in secret CIA prisons. All five have said they were tortured during interrogations. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was repeatedly water-boarded before being brought to Guantanamo. \"We have to talk about torture,\" Air Force Captain Michael Schwartz, a defence lawyer, said on Monday. But Judge James Pohl said the issue was not relevant at this stage. Prosecution lawyers have said the use of waterboarding and similar methods could be relevant when determining whether prisoners' statements were voluntarily given. The court is also expected to hear a defence request to abolish what they term a \"presumptive classification\" that treats any discussion of the CIA prisons as top secret, as well as a media request to limit closing of the courtroom for secret sessions. Judge Pohl ultimately ruled that the defendants would not be forced to attend hearings scheduled to run through the end of this week, but did not rule out further pre-trial hearings. He said all would have to be present for their trial, which is not likely to start for more than a year.",

    "document": "At low doses, lithium prolonged the life of fruit flies in lab experiments. Scientists say the finding is \"encouraging\" and could eventually lead to new drugs to help people live longer and healthier lives. Lithium is used in psychiatry to help stop mood swings but has a risk of serious side-effects at high doses. How lithium acts on the brain is not fully understood, but in fruit flies the drug seems to extend life by blocking a chemical known as GSK-3. \"The response we've seen in flies to low doses of lithium is very encouraging and our next step is to look at targeting GSK-3 in more complex animals with the aim of eventually developing a drug regime to test in humans,\" said Prof Linda Partridge of the UCL Institute of Healthy Ageing, who led the study. The research, published in Cell Reports, found fruit flies lived 16% longer than average when given low doses of lithium. At high doses, lithium reduced their lifespan. \"We found low doses not only prolong life but also shield the body from stress and block fat production for flies on a high sugar diet,\" said co-researcher Dr Ivana Bjedov from the UCL Cancer Institute. Claire Bale of the charity Parkinson's UK, which part-funded the study, said: \"It's encouraging to see that the researchers have been able to identify a key piece of the ageing puzzle, which one day may allow us to intervene in the ageing process.\" \"This research has the potential to not only help create a healthier older generation, but also provide significant insights into how we could potentially treat or even prevent conditions of ageing like Parkinson's.\" Lithium salts have been used in the past as a health tonic and to heal conditions such as gout and migraines. In modern medicine, lithium is used to encourage mood stability in bipolar disorder and is also being considered for the treatment of memory impairment.

    "document": "Kepler-452b orbits at a very similar distance from its star, though its radius is 60% larger. Mission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet. Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life. Nasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home. It is around 1,400 light years away from Earth. Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\" The new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth. Determining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own. Kepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's. The mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet. The new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars. Twelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star. This zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met. Of these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet. Dr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date. \"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue. \"It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.\" While similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b's host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth. \"If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,\" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission. \"The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.\" \"Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.\" Dr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: \"Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet. \"However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make. \"So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.\" Dr Chris Watson, from Queen's University Belfast, UK, commented: \"Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii. \"In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a 'Super-Earth' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really 'Earth-like' given all this?\" He added: \"When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating. \"So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It's this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.\" The findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal. Follow Paul on Twitter.",

    "document": "Mr Trump said they did not discuss his plan to make Mexico pay for the wall - a central plank of his campaign. But Mr Pena Nieto later tweeted: \"I made it clear Mexico would not pay for the wall.\" After the meeting, Mr Trump flew to Phoenix, Arizona, to deliver a key speech on tackling illegal immigration. At their joint press conference in Mexico City, Mr Pena Nieto said Mexicans had been hurt by some of Mr Trump's previous comments but he believed he now genuinely wanted to build relations. The New York businessman called Mexicans \"amazing\" and \"spectacular\" people, in contrast to earlier comments branding Mexican migrants \"rapists\" and \"murderers\". Forcing Mexico to pay for a wall has become a rallying cry among his supporters. His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton said not bringing it up was a sign of cowardice. \"It turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it,\" she tweeted. Mexicans tell Trump: 'You're not welcome!' Donald Trump's Hispanic voter 'doomsday' 'Me gustan los tacos!': A Spanish phrasebook for Trump's visit. The Republican has seen his poll ratings slip since the party conventions last month. Both nationally and in key states, he trails Hillary Clinton, who enjoys particularly strong support among minorities. Donald Trump has called Mexico an enemy of the US, but on Wednesday he said Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was his friend. That contrast illustrates how different Diplomatic Donald was from the firebrand candidate who tore through the Republican primaries by flogging his opponents for being soft on illegal immigration and border security. If the goal of Mr Trump's visit to Mexico City was to represent his nation on the world stage without the kind of embarrassment or controversy that Hillary Clinton warns would be certain if he is elected, then his last-minute trip was a success. But his surprise appearance south of the border may come with a price. It is likely to make it more difficult for him to back away from hard-line immigration positions that are unpopular among moderate voters. Perhaps more grating for Mr Trump's diehard supporters is that he had the chance to confront the Mexican leader and instead spoke of protecting \"hemispheric manufacturing\" and avoided the subject of who would pay for the border wall. Diplomatic Donald may not be the candidate they thought they were getting. Mr Trump said his words to Mr Pena Nieto had been strong and straightforward. He tried to put behind him his previous comments on Mexicans by saying those in the US had made a \"great contribution\". \"I have a great feeling for Mexicans. They are amazing people,\" he said. Mr Trump said he had employed many Mexicans and that they were \"spectacular people with strong values of faith and community\". He went on to list five points he had set out in his talks:. Mr Trump said: \"We recognise and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders.\" But he said there was no discussion on who would pay for the wall. He had earlier threatened to stop cash earned by Mexicans based in the US being sent home until the country paid for it to be built. Mr Trump concluded by saying he was honoured by Mr Pena Nieto's invitation to visit, adding: \"I call you a friend.\" Mr Pena Nieto accepted there were border challenges but pointed out the massive contribution Mexicans have made to the US, and that \"six million jobs rely on exports to Mexico\". He said: \"My priority is to protect Mexicans wherever they may be. Mexicans in the US are honest people, hard-working people who respect their families, their community and the law. They deserve everybody's respect.\" Mr Pena Nieto has invited both US candidates to visit, but has faced criticism at home over Mr Trump. Ex-President Vicente Fox earlier told CNN: \"We don't like him. We don't want him. We reject his visit.\" Former First Lady Margarita Zavala tweeted: \"We Mexicans have dignity, and we reject your hate speech.\" At least two demonstrations have been planned in Mexico City. Mexicans tell Donald Trump: 'You are not welcome' What Trump has said about Mexico. \"They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists\" - May 2015. Mexico is \"ripping off the US more than almost any other nation\" - February 2015. \"Mexico continues to make billions on not only our bad trade deals but also relies heavily on the billions of dollars in remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the United States\" - from his immigration plan. ...and what Mexico has said about Trump. President Pena Nieto spoke out against Mr Trump's \"strident rhetoric\" in March, adding: \"That's how Mussolini got in, that's how Hitler got in, they took advantage of a situation, a problem perhaps, which humanity was going through at the time, after an economic crisis.\" His predecessor, Felipe Calderon, insisted: \"Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall.\" After Mr Trump vowed to reclaim all remittances derived from illegal wages, Mr Calderon's predecessor Vicente Fox, told the BBC: \"Is Trump going to steal the money? How can any human being think like that? It's incredible.\"",

    "document": "But with the Foxes now languishing near the foot of the table and one hotelier claiming the impact of Richard III is slowly wearing off, is the journey over? Or is it a case of what next? Even the most upbeat of Leicester fans would probably find it difficult to be positive about their Premier League title defence as the stats make for pretty grim reading - played 19, won five, drawn five and lost nine. To put that in some context, City lost just three times in the league last season. However, Claudio Ranieri's side are through to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will meet Sevilla for a place in the quarter finals. And after that, only the small matter of European giants such as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona would stand in the way of European glory... Season ticket holder Sam Webster remains quietly confident, but does not think the Foxes can go all the way in Europe. He said: \"We are an unknown entity, and the bigger teams are definitely underestimating us like the big fish did in the Premier League last season. \"Getting to the semis would be remarkable. However, the drastic difference between the Champions League and Premier League form is unacceptable.\" But even if the Foxes are not quite living up to expectations on the pitch, Richard III has helped keep the city buzzing. Amy Gray, head of tourism affairs at VisitBritain, said: \"Money can't buy the publicity - the sort of publicity Leicester has got. \"We saw a 17% increase in international visitors to the East Midlands for April to June. \"What we've seen in Leicester is a fantastic heritage story and a fantastic sports story - and we know both are a fantastic draw to international visitors.\" Source: Leicester Cathedral. Eloic Montagnier, general manager of Leicester's Belmont Hotel, believes interest in other Leicester destinations - such as the National Space Centre after Tim Peake's expedition - has also contributed to the city's success. He said: \"We have done over 80% [occupancy] for the last year. \"It was fantastic in November, with 85% occupancy for the month - it was 65% two years ago. \"I think this is a great opportunity to grow the city and I think it will keep going - I don't see the success dropping off any time soon. \"Football has brought a lot of people in who may never have even considered coming to Leicester.\" But others aren't quite so bullish about the future. Vito Ferro's San Carlo restaurant has become something of a tourist hotspot after it held a celebratory meal for the Leicester City players the day after the title was won. Despite an initial surge in bookings, Mr Ferro believes it will wear off eventually. \"It is too soon to say [whether things will quieten down] because they are in the Champions League,\" he said. \"But I would say, yes, things are eventually going to quieten down unless something else happens.\" So, as Leicester looks ahead to 2017, will good things come in threes with Champions League glory for the Foxes? Or will the city simply have to accept that \"two out of three ain't bad\"? Source: Ernst and Young.",

It also emerged that Rodgers met club representatives for several hours on Wednesday. \"Brendan is a highly-sought after manager and we are pleased we have been able to bring such a high calibre individual to Celtic,\" said chief executive Peter Lawwell. \"I know Brendan feels privileged to be named Celtic manager and he will bring huge experience, knowledge and ability to the role. \"We wanted to bring one of the biggest and best names to the club to match our own aspirations and those of our supporters - we believe, in appointing Brendan, that we have done this. \"We have appointed a special manager and we are sure he can bring some special times to Celtic.\" Media playback is not supported on this device.

    "document": "In a scrappy first half, Joe Garner drew a save from Aberdeen keeper Joe Lewis and crossed for Martyn Waghorn to volley over. Aberdeen dominated after the break as Wes Foderingham saved from Kenny McLean and twice from striker Adam Rooney. But Kenny Miller's brace and Joe Dodoo's third earned Rangers the win. Aberdeen are still well placed to finish runners-up to Premiership champions Celtic, with nine points and a far superior goal difference separating them from Rangers with only six games remaining. Derek McInnes's men started the match as favourites and the early signs suggested they would live up to their billing as they pressed, fought and chased Rangers across every inch of the pitch. It was more a bruising battle than a beautiful game, though, and referee Kevin Clancy was flashing cards early, with Garner and Ryan Jack the first to be booked as they squared up to each other. For all its lack of free-flowing football, it was a very watchable spectacle. Jonny Hayes forced a low save from Foderingham at one end and Waghorn should have burst the net rather than volleying over after a sumptuous cross from Garner on the right. The visitors actually enjoyed the best chances in the early stages despite their lack of fluidity in midfield. Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha said beforehand that his players were entering hell with this trip but it looked more like limbo as both sides continued to cancel each other out. The Portuguese was also well aware that anything other than victory would see his side consigned to third at best. The Ibrox side have obvious frailties at the moment, especially in defence where youngsters are deputising for more experienced injured regulars, but they showed fight and spirit that would be rewarded later in the match. Young David Bates looked slow and ponderous at times although Myles Beerman at left-back was composed and calm when needed. When Aberdeen click, it is mostly down to the hard work of their impressive wide men and so it was in the second half as Niall McGinn and Hayes terrorised the Rangers full-backs. Hayes skipped past two on his way to the box but Graeme Shinnie's hooked shot was blocked by Foderingham. McGinn was at it on the other side and his trickery was feeding Rooney but his fellow Irishman could not convert despite several gilt-edged invitations. You could sense the tide turning though and Rangers were struggling to contain the waves of red battering their defences. For all their efforts though, few chances were seriously testing Foderingham. With 11 minutes remaining, veteran striker Miller scored his 10th goal in 40 appearances this season. Against the run of play, Waghorn created space for himself in the box and when his shot was saved, 37-year-old Miller lashed a fabulous effort high into the back of the net. Aberdeen had no time to compose themselves before Miller made it two when he skipped through a defence in disarray to slide neatly past Lewis and send the small band of Rangers fans wild. Substitute Dodoo played his part in that second goal and he slammed home a third to complete an incredible five minute turnaround that sent the Dons fans scurrying for the exits in disbelief. Those who remained in defiance almost witnessed a Miller hat-trick as he followed up on Dodoo's shot that came back off the crossbar but defender Andrew Considine spared further blushes as he cleared off the line.

The Scot, 28, dominated all aspects of the game but was especially aggressive on the return, denying the big-serving Raonic a single ace and breaking five times. \"The two most important shots in tennis I did really well,\" added Murray. \"I was getting a good read on the serve and, when he missed the first serve, I was being very offensive on the second serve return and putting him under pressure. \"The serve and the return for me were the best they've been for a while and I'm glad, because they weren't so strong the last couple of matches.\" Jamie Murray boosted his hopes of hanging on to the doubles world number one spot for a while longer as he and Brazil's Bruno Soares reached the semi-finals.

    "document": "He was speaking in a BBC interview after a Russian court declared him \"under arrest in absentia\" over the 1990s murder of a Siberian mayor. \"Definitely I'm considering asking for asylum in the UK,\" he said. Mr Putin \"sees me - it's obvious now - as a serious threat\", he said. Once Russia's richest man, the former head of the now defunct Yukos oil firm spent 10 years in a Siberian prison on fraud charges, which he says were politically motivated. Mr Putin pardoned him in 2013 and he now lives abroad, mainly in Switzerland. \"I'm considered by President Putin as a threat, economically, because of the possible seizure of Russian assets abroad, and politically, as someone who will potentially help democratic candidates in the coming 2016 elections,\" he said. Russia will hold elections to the lower house of parliament - the State Duma - next year. The Duma is currently dominated by Mr Putin's supporters. The BBC's Richard Galpin asked Mr Khodorkovsky whether he felt at risk in light of the murders of prominent opponents of Mr Putin in recent years. Among them was former secret agent Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned with radioactive polonium in a London hotel in 2006. \"The history of deaths of opponents of this regime is impressive... but I was in jail for 10 years, I could have been killed any day easily. In London I feel much safer than during those years,\" he replied. When he left Russia in 2013 he said he would not get involved in politics - which was widely believed to have been the reason for his early release. He told the BBC on Wednesday that he would \"help young political activists in Russia to gain political experience and present an alternative to the existing regime\". He said it was \"far too optimistic\" to speak of regime change in Russia now, \"but I'm quite confident that within 10 years the regime will be changed and I hope I will play a significant role in that\". Earlier, referring to the Russian order for his arrest, he said the Moscow authorities had \"gone mad\". He is accused of ordering several of his employees to kill both the mayor and a businessman, who survived. Investigators allege Vladimir Petukhov, the mayor of Nefteyugansk, was killed on 26 June 1998 for demanding Mr Khodorkovsky's oil firm, Yukos, pay taxes that the company had allegedly been avoiding. Local businessman Yevgeny Rybin was allegedly targeted because his activities \"clashed with Yukos's interests\", Russia's powerful Investigative Committee (SK) said in a statement (in Russian). Mr Rybin survived a gun attack in November 1998 and a second attack on his car in March 1999, when another man in the vehicle was killed and several people were injured. Five people have already been tried for the attacks and the arrest warrant is unlikely to make any difference unless Mr Khodorkovsky returns to Russia, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. Armed police raided the Moscow offices of Mr Khodorkovsky's Open Russia pro-democracy movement on Tuesday, in a move that authorities said was linked to allegations of tax evasion. The flats of at least seven activists who work for Mr Khodorkovsky were also searched. After Mr Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, Yukos was broken up and taken over by a state oil firm. Last year an international arbitration court in The Hague said Russian officials had manipulated the legal system to bankrupt Yukos, and jail Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The court told Russia to pay former shareholders in Yukos $50bn (Â£32bn) in compensation. 1963 - Born in Moscow, son of chemical engineers. 1987 - Founds Menatep bank. 1995 - Buys Yukos for $350m, with Menatep assuming $2bn in debt. 2003 - Arrested for tax evasion, embezzlement and fraud. 2005 - Found guilty on six of seven charges, jailed for eight years. 2007 - Yukos declared bankrupt. 2010 - Convicted of embezzlement and money laundering. 2013 - Pardoned by President Putin after request for clemency; leaves Russia for Germany. 2015 - Charged with ordering 1990s murder of Siberian mayor; says he is considering asking for political asylum in the UK.",

He was released on bail to return to an east London police station on 7 December pending further inquiries. The London Cycling Campaign (LCC) group demanded an immediate redesign of the roundabout.

Mr Cairns, who backed the Remain campaign, said: \"In that perspective I think everyone has to look at the sort of European policies that were being developed by the Welsh government, but also by the UK government, that obviously didn't have that connection with the public. \"The public didn't recognise the outcomes that were coming from those policies.\" He added: \"I think the sorts of Objective One funding that we all heard of for many years, as we used to call it, hasn't really had the impact. \"And I think that all assembly members of all political parties have got to reflect on that.\" There was too much complexity and bureaucracy in the way money was spent initially, Mr Cairns said. Although EU-funded policies had become more efficient, \"ultimately they haven't connected with people and I think that we need to reflect and people need to see outcomes\", he said. \"It's not about how much money is spent to go in - it's what comes out at the end.\" David Davies, pro-Brexit Conservative MP for Monmouth, has said he will work with the Welsh Government to ensure Wales gets its fair share of the money saved by leaving the EU. On Friday, First Minister Carwyn Jones called for unity within the Labour party and the nation, saying it would now be \"more difficult to attract investment into Wales and keep jobs in Wales\".

Helder Costa came closest to equalising just before the break but his long-range shot was tipped over by Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale. Wolves pressed late on with several corners but Brighton held on. Walter Zenga's Wolves went into the game having won just two of their past nine away league games with only one clean sheet and they conceded what turned out to be the winning goal after only 16 minutes. Full-back Bong whipped in a pinpoint cross which was headed home by Baldock for his third goal in three games as the Seagulls took control before the break. Top-scorer Glenn Murray almost doubled Brighton's lead early in the second half but his header was narrowly wide and a minute later Knockaert forced a fine save from Carl Ikeme with a long-range left-footed shot.

He began providing them in July after two other suppliers went bust, but has said he has only received one payment. Coperforma said all contractors were paid in full for services received. \"In line with our contractual policy we do not discuss with third parties details of the relationship we have with individual transport service providers,\" a spokesman said. More news from Sussex. Mr Robins, of UK Ambulance Sales, said he lost almost Â£200,000 in the summer after two patient transport companies in Sussex went bust. Coperforma stepped in to keep the service running and, he said, did a deal with him to lease ambulances for six months from 1 July. \"They made payments for 1 July, supposed to be a six-month basis, [and] haven't made payment since. \"Invoiced them for the full amount. Nothing at all, so I feel quite aggrieved about what's gone on,\" Mr Robins said. Not for the first time Coperforma are having to deal with disgruntled contractors. We saw it with VM Langfords, Docklands Medical Services, Dedicated Care in Eastbourne and now UK Ambulance Sales. As the \"managed\" handover between Coperforma and South Central Ambulance Service begins, so people within the industry are telling me that confidence in the service and in Coperforma is fragile.

It might be  that fragility leads to more problems in the months to come. The spokesman for Coperforma said: \"I can categorically state that our payments to our contractors are up to date for service received to support the Sussex patient transport service. \"I can also confirm that we are in different stages of negotiations with a small number of providers over invoice queries which we are trying to resolve as speedily as possible.\" Coperforma is due to hand over its patient transport service for Sussex in a \"managed transition\" to South Central Ambulance Service by next April.",

The Swindon-based WBO European super-middleweight title holder, who was overheard threatening to \"knock out\" Ms Gribovskaja, had denied assault. But he was found guilty after a trial at Croydon Magistrates' Court. The victim was awoken in the early hours of the morning by Cox forcing his way into her flat, the court heard. She called 999 before he broke through her bedroom door. The 29-year-old boxer, who appeared in court under his real name Jamie Russan, was convicted of assault by beating, violence to secure entry, harassment and criminal damage. Alex Slater, prosecuting, said: \"Viktoria said she had never been so scared in her life. She thought he was going to kill her.\" He was heard in a recording of a 999 call, which lasted 21 minutes, to say: \"I will knock you spark out.\" At his trial last month, Cox said he had \"barged\" through Ms Gribovskaja's front and bedroom doors because he feared she \"could kill herself\". He denied putting his hands on her. But magistrates found the victim's account of the confrontation \"credible and convincing\". Nathaniel Ikeazor, representing Cox, told the court the boxer regretted the incident. He said: \"Jamie is remorseful as to how his actions affected Viktoria and affected the relationship thereafter.\" Cox was sentenced to 26 weeks in prison for the assault and harassment charges, 20 weeks for violence to secure entry and 12 weeks for criminal damage, to run concurrently. He was ordered to pay Â£1,105 in compensation to his victim and court costs, and given a restraining order barring him from contacting her indefinitely. Cox showed no emotion as the sentence was handed down. Speaking outside court, his trainer of 10 years, John Costello, said his legal team will appeal against the decision and are \"confident he will clear his name\".

Items believed to be worth more than Â£10m were taken in the raid at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company in London's jewellery quarter. More than 70 safety deposit boxes were ransacked. Perkins, of Heene Road, Enfield, Collins, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington, Jones, of Park Avenue, Enfield and Reader, of Dartford Road, Dartford, were arrested in May. They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle, namely to enter Hatton Garden Safe Deposit in London with intent to steal, between 1 January and 7 April. The four men also faced a charge of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property, but the prosecution said they would not pursue the charge in light of the men's guilty pleas in relation to the conspiracy to burgle charge. Earlier this month a law firm confirmed the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit had gone into liquidation as the company was insolvent and \"owes money to companies and people\". The men will be sentenced at a date to be confirmed. After the burglary, the Met Police launched an investigation into why after police were made aware an intruder alarm had gone off at the scene of the raid it was decided the alarm did not require a response. The force apologised for not following procedures and said it would investigate why the call was given a grade that meant no police response was deemed necessary.

    "document": "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would consider working with Russia in some areas but would stand up for its own interests. Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said Washington was not ready to collaborate militarily with Moscow. US President Donald Trump has called for improved ties with Moscow. But the new administration's diplomatic initiative comes as questions are raised about the Trump team's dealings with Russia dating back to last year's election campaign. US intelligence services have concluded that Moscow hacked into emails of President Donald Trump's Democratic opponents during the election. Rex Tillerson may be on a steep learning curve in the transition from oil executive to top diplomat. But the State Department press corps is also adjusting. We'd become accustomed to the garrulous John Kerry, now we have his opposite: The Quiet Man. So far Mr Tillerson has spared only a few words for us, a \"Good Morning, y'all\" as we boarded the plane in Washington. And he diligently refused to respond to questions shouted out during brief moments of press access at the beginning of his meetings in Bonn, Germany. So we gleaned what we could: he chatted about his flight with the Saudi foreign minister and about jetlag with the Turkish foreign minister. Boris Johnson, the British Foreign Secretary, made him laugh with a joke about the Commonwealth. \"Good try,\" Mr Johnson muttered as we lobbed another question, prompting more laughter but no answer. We were heartened when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made opening remarks, and perplexed when we were ushered out just as Mr Tillerson began to respond. He did give us a 43-second statement on Russia afterwards. And eventually a few spontaneous words as the questions continued. All in a hard day's work. And three of Mr Trump's aides have been forced out over allegations about their links with Russia, including National Security Adviser Mike Flynn earlier this week. Mr Tillerson met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Germany as part of his first foreign trip in his new job. He said the US was willing to co-operate with Russia if Moscow lived up to its commitments. \"As I made clear at my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical co-operation that will benefit the American people,\" he said. \"Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies. The secretary of state added that he expected Russia to honour its commitment to the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, and to work to stabilise the region. Russia's role in backing separatists in the east of the country has soured relations with the West since the conflict began in 2014. Mr Lavrov said the two sides had agreed to co-operate in areas where their interests coincided, particularly in the fight against terrorism, over Syria and in other countries in the Middle East where \"terrorism has put down roots\". However, he said that they did not discuss US sanctions against Russia, first imposed when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine nearly three years ago. Mr Tillerson, who as ExxonMobil CEO was perceived to be close to the Russian leadership, told his nomination hearing in the Senate that he would consider reviewing the sanctions. Mr Tillerson also met the UK's Boris Johnson and other foreign ministers from the G20, made up of developed economies and emerging nations including China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil. At a Nato meeting in Brussels, Gen Mattis rejected calls by Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu to \"restore co-operation with the Pentagon\". \"We are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward,\" he told reporters. The defence secretary said that Russia had to abide by international law, adding that there was \"little doubt\" that Moscow had interfered or attempted to interfere in several Western elections.",

The jihadists have also entered a nearby military base amid further clashes, a military spokesman said. Eastern Mosul was retaken last month. Thursday's advance brings the army within less than a mile (1.6km) of western Mosul, where the militants are expected to launch attacks from densely populated neighbourhoods. After darkness fell, government armour could be seen lining up for a new move forward, the BBC's Quentin Sommerville reports from the scene. Thursday's assault began with air strikes by the US-led coalition before armoured columns advanced to the airport's perimeter. An Iraqi lieutenant was killed by one of the roadside bombs planted in the area by IS, the BBC has learned. Iraqi forces also came under fire from IS militants holed up inside airport buildings, reports said. Foreign troops from the US-led coalition were with the attacking troops, officials told the Associated Press news agency, without specifying their nationality. The airport's runway has been destroyed by IS but our correspondent, who is embedded with Iraqi federal police units, says it still has value. It is a large piece of land and controlling it will help secure southern routes to west Mosul, our correspondent says. The airport and the al-Ghazlani base are on Mosul's southern outskirts on the western side of the Tigris river. Thousands of Iraqi troops, backed by artillery and air power, are involved in the assault to retake Mosul. Leaflets warning residents of an imminent offensive were earlier dropped over western Mosul, where military officials say narrow winding streets could make retaking the area particularly difficult. Although slightly smaller than the east, western Mosul is more densely populated and includes districts seen as pro-IS. The UN has voiced concern about the welfare of civilians trapped in the city. Aram Shakaram, the country deputy director for Save the Children in Iraq, told the BBC he believed relatively few people had been able to escape the city since Wednesday. He said the charity believed that nearly 800,000 people were still trapped there. We are very scared, and we are worried that the final stages are going to take long. S will not give up and withdraw that easily and the whole operation might take as long as it did in east Mosul. I won't lie, I am scared too and I don't know if I am going to die in an air strike or killed by an IS fighter. Voices from West Mosul: 'Everyone is scared' More than 160,000 people have fled their homes in and around the city. The UN said in late January that almost half of all the casualties in Mosul were civilians. All bridges linking the east and west of the city, across the Tigris river, have been destroyed by air strikes.

The 50-day conflict between Israel and Gaza militants, lasted from July to late August 2014. It left at least 2,189 Palestinians dead, including more than 1,486 civilians, according to the UN. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers were killed along with six civilians. The 277-page report, released by the Israeli foreign ministry, disputed the UN figures, estimating that 2,125 Palestinians had been killed, including 936 militants and 761 civilians, with the status of the remaining casualties unknown. It said that Hamas militants disguised themselves as civilians and converted civilian buildings into military centres. \"This exploitation of civilian surroundings - which often constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity - posed significant operational, legal and ethical challenges for the IDF,\" the report said. \"Harm to the civilian population... occurred as the result of unfortunate - yet lawful - incidental effects of legitimate military action in the vicinity of civilians and their surroundings,\" it added. \"Israel did not intend, and deeply regrets, the harm caused to the Palestinian civilian population and surroundings during the 2014 Gaza Conflict.\" A spokesman for Hamas said the Israeli report was \"valueless\". \"Israeli war crimes are clear because they were committed in front of live cameras,\" Sami Abu Zuhri said. Meanwhile, a report from the UN Human Rights Council on the war is also expected to be published this week. The council says its inquiry will cover \"all violations of international humanitarian law\" committed by both sides during the Gaza conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday: \"Whoever wants a baseless, automatic accusation against Israel can waste their time reading the UN report.\" In April, a UN inquiry said that at least 44 Palestinians had been killed by \"Israeli actions\" while sheltering at seven UN schools during the war. The inquiry also found that three empty UN schools were used by Palestinian militants to store weapons, and that in two cases they likely fired from them.",

It was a memorable win for the Liberians against Kabylie who are among the 10 most successful clubs in African competitions. Mulbah broke the deadlock in a goalmouth scramble on 58 minutes and completed the rout after Sarkoh punished a blunder from Algeria goalkeeper Malek Asselah. The unexpectedly heavy loss for Kabylie was another blow to Algerian football, after the Desert Foxes were eliminated from the recent Africa Cup of Nations at the group phase. Kabylie's loss was followed by defeat for another Algerian side, Mouloudia Alger, who are also former African champions. They were beaten 2-1 away to debutants Bechem United of Ghana, but will at least have an away goal to take into their return leg next weekend. Elsewhere, Rayon Sports of Rwanda are virtually assured of a last-32 place in Africa's second-tier club competition after beating newcomers Al Salam Wau of South Sudan 4-0 in Juba. Savio Nshuti triggered a second-half goal rush by netting after 54 minutes and Pierrot Kwizera, Nova Bayama and Moussa Camara scored in the final quarter as Salam collapsed. Bosnian Enes Sipovic notched the second-half winner as Ittihad Tanger of Morocco, experiencing continental football for the first time, came from behind to defeat Douanes of Niger 2-1 in Niamey. There was more success for Morocco as second division outfit MAS Fes used home advantage to build a 3-0 lead over former African champions CARA of Congo Brazzaville. An embarrassing blunder by the Congolese goalkeeper, who allowed a harmless low cross to slip from his grasp, gifted Ivorian Koffi Boua the first goal for 2011 Confederation Cup winners Fes. Al Hilal Benghazi of Libya overcame the handicap of not being able to play at home by beating fellow Confederation Cup debutants Ulinzi Stars of Kenya 1-0 in Cairo. Ahmed Al Abbar scored the winner just after half-time for Hilal, who were forced to move the fixture to Egypt on security grounds. Volcan of the Comoros exceeded expectations by drawing 0-0 with Vipers of Uganda in Kampala, raising the prospect of a first overall African success by a club from the multi-island Indian Ocean nation. Record three-time title-holders CS Sfaxien of Tunisia are among 12 clubs who received byes into the round of 32. Like the Champions League, the Confederation Cup will have a new look this season and increased prize money. The number of qualifying rounds before play-offs against Champions League last-32 losers has been cut to two and the group phase expanded from eight clubs to 16.

He guided Wales to a second Grand Slam in 2012 after narrowly missing out on the 2011 World Cup final. \"We were disappointed not getting to the final in 2011,\" he said. \"We feel a little bit the same this time around. \"There's a little bit of frustration as we felt we could have gone a bit further in the World Cup, although we were proud of what we achieved given the number of injuries we had.\" Wales qualified alongside Australia from their World Cup pool despite a host of injuries to key players such as Leigh Halfpenny, Jonathan Davies and Rhys Webb. Wales were knocked out of the World Cup by two-time champions South Africa in the quarter-final despite leading with 10 minutes remaining. Webb and Halfpenny are still out injured, but centre Davies has returned while backs Liam Williams and Hallam Amos are returning to fitness.

Nature charity the WWF says a total of 139 new species have been found in the South East Asia area in the past year. There are 90 plants, 23 reptiles, 16 amphibians, 9 fish and 1 mammal. The Mekong delta, which covers the countries of Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Thailand and Vietnam, is one of the world's richest and diverse wildlife regions. A total of 2,216 new species have been discovered in the region in the past 17 years: that's about three every week. Now conservationists believe it's a race against the clock to document all of them, as they say threats to their habitat could mean species go extinct before they're even discovered. The colour changing thorny frog has a distinctive spiny back. At night its spikes have a pink and yellow colour; but in the daytime the yellow turns into a darker brown. The wolf snake (above) is very well camouflaged, it has large non-venomous teeth on both jaws and blends well into its mountain forest home. The crocodile newt lives around ponds and shaded places. Scientists have known about it for a long time but it's only recently been confirmed as a new species. The name of this stick insect is nearly as long as its body. The Phryganistria heusii yentuensis is the second-longest insect in the world at 54cm long - that's over half a metre! But even this is shorter than the biggest ever, discovered in Borneo: Phobaeticus chani is more than 56cm long. This bent-toed gecko is the 10,000th reptile recorded on Earth.

    "document": "The fall of the town is a boost for the rebels as they battle to capture the divided city of Aleppo. Al-Rai's capture after several days of heavy fighting secures an important supply line from Turkey for the rebels. Separately, at least 200 people are missing after an IS attack on a factory near Damascus, the government says. Workers were reportedly taken from a dormitory where they were staying on the outskirts of the town of Dumeir, about 40km (25 miles) east of the capital. Activists from the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights say about 140 workers managed to escape. Initially there was confusion over who attacked the factory, with some sources suggesting the abductions were carried out by a rebel group called Jaysh Tahrir al-Sham. A factory administrator said no-one had been able to contact the workers since the assault on Monday. The area around Dumeir has seen fierce fighting between government forces and IS militants in recent days. The BBC's Lina Sinjab in Lebanon says that al-Rai is a crucial stronghold for IS as it sits on a crossing linking Turkey to Syria. The Observatory said that an alliance of \"rebel factions and Islamists\" had captured the town. Control of al-Rai allows opposition fighters to lay siege to positions held by IS to the north of Aleppo and cut the group's supply lines, a commander of the opposition al-Mutasim Brigade was quoted as telling local media. Al-Rai can now be be used by opposition groups as a launching pad for future operations against IS in the east and south, the commander, Mohamed Hassan Khalil, added. He said that the main dangers faced by the opposition groups fighting IS were improvised mines, booby-trapped vehicles and suicide bombers. Earlier this week IS jihadists said they had launched several attacks around north-east Damascus, including Tishrin power station and Dumeir military airport. A Syrian military source told Reuters there had been attacks but all of the militants who took part in them had been killed. It comes almost two weeks after Syrian government and allied forces recaptured the ancient city of Palmyra from IS fighters.

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device. The 19-year-old nephew of trainer Willie Mullins led the 33-1 chance to victory in his first ride in the world-famous race. His nine-year-old mount, trained by Mouse Morris, triumphed by six lengths. \"Everything just went to plan. I couldn't give you a word to describe how I feel,\" said the jockey. The youngster had never even walked the Aintree course before Saturday's race, but he showed his skill to make up three lengths on The Last Samuri after the final fence to take the lead at the Elbow and go on to win. Rule The World, who has twice broken his pelvis, was the first horse since the 19th century to claim his maiden win over fences at the Grand National. David Mullins was pleased to play his part in the victory for owners Gigginstown House Stud, headed by airline boss Michael O'Leary. \"Credit to Mouse, he told me before that this is probably one of the best horses he's ever had, he's just had small problems,\" added the teenager. \"So to get the call to ride this one was amazing. \"I was getting worried that everything was going to plan, and then we hit the fourth-last [fence], and I was kind of delighted once we got back into a rhythm after that that something had gone wrong and it was going to happen coming across the line.\" While there was joy for Mullins, there was frustration for Gigginstown's retained jockey Bryan Cooper, who opted to ride the winner's stable-mate First Lieutenant. They fell at the second. O'Leary had sympathy for Cooper, who rode Don Cossack to victory in last month's Cheltenham Gold Cup. \"Bryan had first choice, and to be fair to him, First Lieutenant has been working out of his skin,\" he said. \"When Bryan made the decision on Thursday or Friday we were expecting good ground - had it been that way it would have been a very different race. \"But the rain came and it favoured horses at the bottom end of the handicap. \"Had Bryan been able to make the decision at three o'clock today he may well have chosen Rule The World. \"That's the problem for retained riders: sometimes they have to make tough decisions and they get it wrong.\" After his National win, Mullins rode Ivan Grozny (16-1) to victory for his uncle in the last race of the day. \"You dream of things like this,\" he said. \"I couldn't ask for much more. and to have a win for Willie is great after he gave me some good rides at Cheltenham.\" Earlier in the day, Paul Townend, replacing the injured Ruby Walsh, had a short-priced double on Yorkhill (3-10 fav) in the Mersey Novices Hurdle and Douvan (2-13 fav) in the Maghull Novices Chase, to help him to the leading jockey award.

    "document": "Not far away, in Brooklyn Bridge Park, where once derelict piers have been converted into outdoor sports centres, the soccer pitches are usually more crowded than the basketball courts. A short walk down the hill, an archway under the Manhattan Bridge last summer hosted one of New York's World Cup \"viewing parties\", where thousands gathered to watch games, and not just those involving the American national team. So it seemed incongruous to stand in front of the courthouse last week, fielding questions from presenters in London about why a country with no interest in football had suddenly assumed the role of global policeman of the global game. That line of inquiry seemed about a decade out of date.  It is akin to the blanket condemnation that Americans lack a sense of humour or irony - this in the land of Jon Stewart, Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock, Amy Poehler, Jerry Seinfeld, David Letterman and Garry Shandling. True, football, or soccer as it is known here, is not as central to American as it is to European, African or South and Central American life. Nowhere near. Up until recently, the game has been unloved by the major US television networks, which have long bemoaned the lack of breaks in play, the paucity of goals and the glut of draws. Absent from the US game are big-name male stars and big-name clubs. The New York Red Bulls will never rival the New York Yankees. Real Salt Lake pales, rather risibly, alongside Real Madrid. However, football is no longer met with American indifference. Nor any more does it offer proof of America's sporting isolationism. In this polyglot nation, the game is growing in popularity and importance, an upward trend that will continue long into the future as America becomes less white and more Hispanic. Already, America is the number one country in the world for youth participation in football. More than three million youngsters were registered to play in 2014, compared with just 103,432 in 1974. Major League Soccer matches now have a higher average attendance - 19,148 in 2014 - than basketball and ice hockey. The game ranks third after American football and baseball. Though the crowds here are significantly smaller than in the Bundesliga in Germany, the Premier League in England and Wales, La Liga in Spain or Serie A in Italy, they are on average bigger than in Argentina, Brazil, China or the Football League Championship. Bundesliga: 43,532. Premier League: 36,083. La Liga: 26,803. Serie A: 22,019. Major League Soccer (in 2014): 19,148. The Seattle Sounders, America's most-watched team, attracts larger crowds for home games than Everton, Tottenham, Aston Villa or even Chelsea. The strength of the game in Seattle is also a measure of how its popularity extends well beyond the new immigrant hubs of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Sporting Kansas City, in the American heartland, is also one of the better-supported sides. Last year's World Cup in Brazil witnessed record viewing figures in America, even though the national team did not make it past the final 16. And even after it exited the tournament, viewers kept tuning in - 29.2 million for the final between Germany and Argentina. By comparison, that year's baseball world series attracted 13.5 million. Nor is American enthusiasm for the World Cup a new phenomenon - more than 18 million people watched the 1994 final between Brazil and Italy - but it has been growing. The average viewing figure for matches in last year's World Cup matches was 4.3 million, up 50% from 2010. All those kids who grew up playing the game are now, as adults, watching it. More video:. Soccer seen as â€˜sissyballâ€™ in Deep South. Why US soccer has no relegation. Do Native Americans play football? Football in America also transcends the gender divide. Of the kids playing the game, 48% are girls. The USA has twice won Fifa's Women's World Cup, a record matched only by Germany. Mia Hamm, who accumulated a staggering 275 caps and scored 158 international goals, has been called America's greatest female athlete of the past 40 years. In terms of her marketability, Nike ranked her alongside Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan. It is also worth remembering that one of the most sought after demographics in American politics is the country's army of suburban \"soccer moms.\" The term is hardly new. It was coined in the mid-1990s. Money is another indicator of the game's attractiveness. NBC splashed out $240m (Â£160m) for the rights to Premier League football between 2013-16, three times more than Fox paid for the previous contract. With a fierce bidding war now under way, the next deal is expected to dwarf that figure. The wider availability of Premier League matches, which attract much bigger television audiences than domestic games, is also helping to raise the profile of the sport. Gone are the days when diehard fans used to have to find bars open on a Saturday morning with satellite feeds beamed in from Europe. Now every single Premier League game is available on cable. Ditto the FA Cup and Uefa Champions League. On Univision, the American Spanish language network with viewing figures on a par with the major US networks, soccer, unsurprisingly, is the number one sport. Broadcasting live matches has fuelled the channel's rapid rise. No longer do foreigners have to explain the intricacies of the offside rule to perplexed locals, or why games are allowed to finish in a tie (a draw). Many Americans are now fully literate in the sport. So while American soccer may never rival American football, the notion that it remains a niche sport is absurd. Though gridiron, baseball, basketball and ice hockey are known here as the \"Big Four\" sports, soccer has surely ousted ice hockey to join that quartet. It is the fourth most popular high school sport for boys, and the third for girls. There are many reasons why the US Department of Justice mounted these prosecutions. Two of those indicted, Jeffrey Webb and Chuck Blazer, were dominant figures in the American game. Jack Warner, of Trinidad and Tobago, used to head up Concacaf, the Miami-based Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football. Prosecutors claim the alleged bribery scheme relied heavily on the US banking system. But although the US authorities have also targeted foreign nationals, they do not regard soccer as a foreign sport. Announcing the charges, FBI director James Comey stressed how American kids and others at the grassroots had been deprived of resources. The FBI has cast a global dragnet, but this is also a homeland investigation. The Fifa allegations dominated the media here last week, and, paradoxically, that marks another milestone in the game's recognition. The game has moved from the back pages to the front.",

    "document": "He was rattling across the arid wastes of the Baluch desert in Pakistan on Saturday morning in that most Afghan of cars - a battered white Toyota Corrola - when the missile, fired from a US drone, struck his vehicle. All that was left was a charred and twisted wreck beside the desert highway. US President Barack Obama described his death as an \"important milestone\", but disentangling what it actually marks is not straightforward. The most obvious question is what it will mean for the Taliban. The Pentagon said it had targeted Mansour because he had become \"an obstacle to peace and reconciliation\". But it isn't clear that the new leader will be any more open towards the peace process. Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhunzada was Mullah Mansour's former deputy, and the official line from the Taliban is that his approach is going to be very similar. What's more, his appointment doesn't rule out the possibility of a battle for succession. Mansour struggled to contain the splintering of the movement into a series of factions that followed the death of Mullah Omar, the founder of the Taliban. That would increase instability in Afghanistan, fuelling local conflicts and entrenching the insurgency. Taliban leader Mullah Mansour killed, Afghans confirm. Afghan Taliban announce successor to Mullah Mansour. Mullah Mansour's battle to be leader. Who are the Taliban? Profile: Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour. Then, there is the question of what it means for US relations with Pakistan, which are regarded as crucial to the effort to fight global terrorism. The drone attack suggests the US has lost patience with the Pakistani authorities, which have failed to bring the Taliban to the table, while allegedly harbouring the movement's leaders. So the killing of Mullah Mansour may actually set back the efforts to negotiate a peace settlement. On Monday, the US ambassador was summoned to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry to be harangued about what it described as a \"violation of Pakistan's sovereignty\". The official Pakistani line is that the attack will be an obstacle to future talks. The third question is the one most likely to affect those outside the region: the impact on the drugs trade. It would be tempting to conclude that removing Mansour will make the battle to eradicate opium more straightforward. Mansour helped oversee the transformation of the Taliban from a movement of pious fanatics, largely funded by true believers from abroad, into something very different. After the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, remittances from the Gulf fell away. The Taliban needed new sources of finance. Mullah Mansour is thought to have developed a huge new source of income for the Taliban - along the way enriching himself and his fellow tribesmen. The movement he officially took over last year had been refashioned into what is, in effect, a multi-billion dollar drugs cartel. Afghanistan has now completely eclipsed the former hub of world opium production, the so-called Golden Triangle between Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. But whether the death of Mansour will reduce Afghanistan's opium production is a moot point. Helmand is a Taliban stronghold and traditionally accounts for around half of Afghan opium output. A senior official admitted to the BBC that the intense conflict in the province meant there had been virtually no eradication effort at all this season. Nevertheless, there is evidence that some farmers are moving away from poppy and back to less profitable food crops. One reason may be the effects of a mysterious blight that badly affected last year's poppy harvest. Take a look at the changing patterns of cultivation in these desert areas of Helmand. These images are taken from a forthcoming AREU Watching Brief: Moving with the times: How opium poppy cultivation had adapted to the changing environment in Afghanistan. At the same time, there is considerable evidence that poppy production has increased in areas that are - nominally at least - controlled by the government. Last week, I visited an agricultural community just half an hour away from Mazar-e-Sharif in the north of Afghanistan. The city is, by Afghan standards, a model of good governance and has never been a stronghold of the Taliban, yet I found poppy being grown openly. Conversations with locals suggest that poppy production is not just tolerated, but is actively supported and protected by local police and government officials in return for kickbacks. \"Of course the authorities know we are growing poppies,\" a farmer called Taza Meer told me. \"They can see we are growing it, but they've got to keep quiet about it. The economy here is weak, people have no money. \"The authorities know poppy is the only way people here can make decent money, and they know that people would be very angry if they stopped them.\" He said if the government came in and destroyed his crop or that of other farmers, they would \"take to the mountains\". \"The people will take up arms,\" he told me. \"They'll have no choice but to rebel and there will be chaos here.\" Experts on opium cultivation say this is a pattern repeated across the country. They say opium cultivation is a sign of the weakness of the government. It occurs when local authorities have no choice but to come to an accommodation with farmers. On that basis, there has been a steady deterioration of central authority, as this chart illustrates. It is striking that more opium was produced in 2014, the last year of the Nato combat mission, than in any other year since the UN started keeping records in 2002. Mansour may be dead - but, in the absence of other successful businesses, the opium trade has become an increasingly important enterprise in areas the government controls as well as Taliban-controlled areas. What that suggests is that, whoever is leader of the Taliban, Afghanistan is likely to continue to be the world centre of opium production. Indeed, this year, Afghanistan is expected to produce more opium - and therefore heroin - than the world consumes. It isn't hard to work out what that means: more and cheaper heroin coming to a street near you.",

They are in danger of missing out on a top-four finish in the league for the first time since the 2003-04 season. \"There's a lot more to come from this team,\" Murphy told BBC Leicester Sport. \"Hopefully the Anglo-Welsh Cup can be the catalyst to kick on in the Premiership. There is a long way to go in the season. \"I am confident we can make the top four and challenge when everyone is looking around and saying 'what are you doing here?' We can answer that emphatically.\" Tigers are a point behind fourth-placed Bath with five games remaining, but 11 adrift of Saracens who are third. They have lost seven of their 17 matches, but welcome respite has come in the Anglo-Welsh Cup where they beat Saracens 32-10 in Saturday's semi-final. Murphy, who is part of Aaron Mauger's backroom set-up and has been on the coaching team since retiring in 2013 after 16 seasons as a Tigers player, has taken on a leading role in this season's competition. The 38-year-old said the players fully deserved their place in the final at Twickenham Stoop. \"A lot of people have been saying, 'Hold on a second. How did you guys get here? That wasn't in the script',\" he said. \"We have been really good so far in the competition. We have picked some young guys, some inexperienced guys and some players who haven't had a lot of field time. \"We have developed a hell of a lot. We have had different styles of wins. Our opening win against Bath was really tenacious; we had to dig in and fight for everything and we won by a point. \"We had a good win against Newport at home where we put some scores on and played more attractive rugby. And we had a tight win against Saints. \"We went away to Saracens in the pool stages and lost, but the most impressive thing for me was that we learned the lessons from that game. We went back down there at the weekend and executed a game plan and got into the final. Our forwards had a great game. \"The consistent thing from the players who have taken the field is they have been really passionate and have worked hard for each other. \"One of the things we have asked of them is to be able look at each other at the end of the game and know they have given it absolutely everything. So far that has been the case.\"",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. His career high came in the 1970s and included the anthemic Baker Street and Stuck in the Middle with You, recorded with his band Stealers Wheel. Rafferty had battled a drink problem and spent time in hospital in Bournemouth with liver failure. He was born in Paisley and began his musical career as a busker on the London Underground. Rafferty died peacefully at his home in Dorset, with his daughter Martha at his bedside. It is understood his funeral will be held in Paisley later this month. Rafferty had recorded and toured with Billy Connolly as part of the Humblebums, before forming Stealers Wheel with his friend Joe Egan in 1972. Stuck in the Middle with You was a hit in the early 70s and also appeared on the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's debut film Reservoir Dogs in 1992. Baker Street charted in the UK and US in 1978 after Rafferty began his solo career and still achieves airplay on radio stations around the world. Musican Raphael Ravenscroft, who played the song's famous saxophone melody, described Rafferty as \"a fantastic writer\" who \"wrote some of my favourite songs of all time.\" In a statement, Billy Connolly called Rafferty \"a hugely talented songwriter and singer who will be greatly missed\". He added, \"I was privileged to have spent my formative years working with Gerry and there remained a strong bond of friendship between us that lasted until his untimely death. \"Gerry had extraordinary gifts and his premature passing deprives the world of a true genius.\" Music journalist and BBC Radio 2 presenter Paul Gambaccini said it was a cruel irony that Baker Street, about Rafferty's unhappiness with being a star, brought him more of the fame he hated. Gambaccini said: \"He just wasn't of the constitution to deal with the music business, or to respect it. \"And thus he found fame and artistic success incompatible, and he became a wanderer, a lonely man, allegedly a drinker. And now we have this unhappy end.\" Musician and BBC 6 Music presenter Tom Robinson said Rafferty would be greatly missed. \"I'm deeply saddened to hear that Gerry has lost the battle with his failing health,\" he said. \"His early work with Stealers Wheel was an inspiration to a whole generation of songwriters in the 70s, including me. \"Many of us had hoped his recent album Life Goes On in 2009 would lead to a full-time return to writing and performing for a lyrical and highly gifted artist.\" BBC News website readers from around the world have sent in their tributes:. Don't Speak of My Heart was my favourite. His voice was like velvet.  Calmed me down just listening to him. I cannot believe he has gone. Susan Miller, Kilmaurs, Ayrshire, Scotland. Have followed his releases from Stealers Wheel to present. He wrote beautiful songs and he and Joe Egan, who sadly didn't get the same recognition, have left me some great musical memories. George Morris, Donaghadee, County Down, Northern Ireland. As a muso myself, I loved the arrangement of the haunting Baker Street and often performed Stuck In The Middle With You with a band I was a part of in the 80s and 90s in England. Both songs are played frequently on New Zealand radio stations. Gerry will be sorely missed. Tony Last, Hastings, New Zealand. My first LP was Can I Have my Money Back, which I still have. My favourite song is The Ark from City to City with Jerry Donahue on guitar. He wrote about life itself, things one can relate to. He brought musical quality into life at times when there was not much around. Keith Dhan-Weller, Nuertingen, Germany. Baker Street is probably my favourite song. I'm a songwriter and I teach creative writing. Baker Street is about Gerry's own experience with the music industry but he wrote the lyric in the third person. This makes the story more interesting and sad. The song works on so many different levels. Musically and lyrically. Richard Abbott, Limavady, Northern Ireland. I was a young radio producer with BBC Scotland in the late 1960s when a couple of lads came in to Queen Margaret Drive to take part in some programmes.

Little did we know... Alan Muirhead, Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria, England. My eldest daughter was in school with his daughter Martha when Gerry lived in Kilmacolm. My husband and I were great fans of his music and songs and are sorry to hear of his death. Rita Walker, Greenock, Scotland. Gerry Rafferty had depths beyond his two best-selling singles.

More than 300 oil workers were airlifted from the Norwegian sector of the North Sea after the high winds broke the barge's anchor. Stormy weather in the area has seen waves topping 15m (50ft). A man died when a huge wave hit another rig earlier in the Troll field off Norway. The strong winds tore the barge from its moorings and sent it towards BP's Valhall platform, located in the middle of the North Sea between Norway and the UK. The oil and gas company was forced to shut down output and evacuate staff on board. ConocoPhillips also stopped production and evacuated crew from installations in the same area. A spokeswoman for the Rescue Coordination Centre for southern Norway told the Reuters news agency that the danger posed by the barge was now over. \"There are no other installations between the barge and the coast of Norway,\" Borghild Eldoen said. \"It is now up to the owners of the barge to stop it before it reaches the coast.\" At one point fears about a collision increased when the barge - 110m in length and 30m wide - changed course and headed straight for Valhall, BP  Norway spokesman Jan Erik Geirmo told the AFP news agency.

The Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the NPG will all contribute to the total cost, which is £555,000. The portrait, which has never been seen in public, has temporarily gone on show at the London gallery. Diallo, who was from a prosperous family of religious clerics, was captured as a slave in Africa at the age of 29 and was transported to work on a plantation in America. Read Will's blog. After he was imprisoned for trying to escape, he met lawyer Thomas Bluett who, impressed by Diallo's intellect and education, took him to England. Diallo was received with great enthusiasm by aristocrats and scholars. The National Portrait Gallery said Hoare's painting was the first British portrait that honoured a named African subject as an individual and an equal. A spokesman for the gallery told the BBC News website that the work - which had been in a private collection - had sold at auction in Christie's in London in December for £554,937.50. Following the sale, then Culture Minister Margaret Hodge put a temporary export bar on the painting and gave British museums and galleries the opportunity to buy it if they could match the price.

    "document": "The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it has followed the US too blindly, as in the invasion of Iraq, against the warnings of many in Europe. Britain has done better when it has played its traditional role as a bridge between the two continents: seeking to manage America's swings between isolationism and interventionism while at the same time reassuring Europe that the US could be more than just a brash Nato ally. This Atlanticist analysis is, of course, a simplification of a complex relationship, but the point stands: the UK has a unique opportunity by virtue of its history and geography to bring the US and Europe together, not take sides. And yet the election of Donald Trump risks doing just that, driving a wedge between Britain and the EU just when both sides need it least. Since the president-elect's shock election, the British government has staggered, recovered its balance and started making overtures to the emerging administration. Its public statements have been welcoming and warm. Here is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's latest description of the president-elect, in a Czech newspaper: \"Donald Trump is dealmaker, he is a guy who believes firmly in values that I believe in too - freedom and democracy. As far as I understand, he is in many aspects a liberal guy from New York.\" This is a long way from the criticisms that he and Prime Minister Theresa May uttered during the campaign. But both are now eating their words without shame, for they believe that it is in the national interest for the government to engage with next president of the United States, whatever his character, temperament and policy agenda. The prime minister's Guildhall speech - arguing that everyone should benefit from globalisation - may have been designed to show British voters that she has an agenda for change. But it also sent a strong signal to Mr Trump that she understood the forces that led to his election and the shared need for the whole world to address them. In contrast, some EU countries have worn their hearts on their sleeve and expressed their dissatisfaction at the election of a man whose opinions they find distasteful. This was the context of the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers this week, which Boris Johnson dismissed as a \"whinge-o-rama\". Some British diplomats saw the meeting as an attempt by the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to grandstand and use Mr Trump's election to drive forward her own agenda for more EU defence cooperation. She was distinctly sarcastic about Mr Johnson's refusal to attend the meeting, saying it was \"normal\" for a country that had decided to leave the EU not to be interested in its relations with the US. As if that were not enough, Mr Johnson also clashed with his EU counterparts over Turkey, urging them not to lecture Ankara over the death penalty. And some EU leaders will not like Mrs May acknowledging the strength of Mr Trump's anti-globalisation arguments just as they prepare to do electoral battle with populist parties flying the same anti-establishment flag. So on the face of it, Britain is falling out with Europe over Mr Trump just when its overwhelming foreign policy objective should be preparing the way for Brexit, working closely with European allies to find the areas of common ground where a potential deal could be done. This should be a time for cool diplomacy, not hot-headed spats over who is going to which meeting. And all this before the tough decisions come. Responding to an election is one thing. It is quite another to choose sides when there are real policy dilemmas on the table. What happens if Mr Trump makes overtures to Russia and calls for sanctions over Ukraine to be reduced? What happens if Mr Trump ends US support for Syrian rebels and orders the US military to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State group? This was the one issue of substance Messrs Trump and Putin discussed in their telephone call this week. And what happens if Mr Trump is true to his word and reduces the US commitment to Nato? All of these are policy choices that could see the UK not only reverse longstanding positions but also place itself at odds with either the US or the EU. This is the context for Mrs May's trip to Berlin on Friday where she will meet President Obama and four of her most important European counterparts, from Germany, France , Italy and Spain. The challenge for this untested, newly appointed prime minister will be to walk that traditional fine line between the US and Europe. She has to prepare the way for these tough policy decisions, urging Europe to engage with a president-elect who cannot be ignored. But equally she will be under some pressure to make it clear to the travelling Americans that Britain will not roll over and accept automatically whatever foreign policy emerges from a Trump-led Washington. The UK-US relationship is hardly special at the moment. Mr Trump has shown no hesitation at embarrassing Mrs May by giving Nigel Farage a photo-opportunity at Trump Towers, giving the impression that the UKIP leader is filling a vacuum left by the Foreign Office. Mr Obama has chosen to visit Greece and Germany and not the UK on a valedictory European tour and in a news conference described Chancellor Merkel as \"probably... my closest international partner these eight years\". In vain did David Cameron flip those burgers in the Downing Street garden with the president. As the one time US Secretary of State Dean Acheson once wrote: \"Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America... but unique did not mean affectionate.\" So the task now for the British government is to engage with Mr Trump's incipient administration and do what it can - if anything - to shape and influence his foreign policy before firm positions are established. Officials recognise there is a window of opportunity in the coming weeks that should not be wasted that could set the terms for discussions about trade and security. Mrs May is pushing for an early meeting with Mr Trump before the inauguration in January. The Foreign Office is already holding talks with the Trump team about the possibility of Mr Johnson travelling to Washington to meet the Vice-President-elect, Mike Pence, and potentially others in the Trump team in the next few weeks. Officials insist that these discussions began before Mr Farage began claiming his ambassadorial role with Mr Trump. But at the same time, the government also has to ensure that this process of engagement with the US does not make Brexit harder by losing what little political support it still has in Europe's chancelleries. The former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV this week that Britain's focus should be on Europe. \"For the first time really, the most important decisions over the next few years are going to be about our relationship with Europe, not about our relationship with the United States,\" he said. In the past few months, the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump have overturned many of Britain's traditional foreign policy assumptions. The government needs to repair relations with both the US and the EU while not antagonising both in process. Falling between the two geopolitical stools would leave the UK floundering mid-Atlantic without a paddle.",

    "document": "\"I am seriously considering emigrating to Australia, Jamaica or the US,\" says Faye Jones. The 32-year-old PA from Wokingham jumps every time there's a knock at the door and tiptoes around neighbours who might call the police. Her crime? Five years ago, Faye was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and after suffering from the side effects of prescribed drugs, she now uses cannabis to ease her pain, nausea and inflammation. In the UK, where cannabis is a Class B drug, police can issue warnings or on-the-spot fines for possession of a small amount, while courts can impose sentences of up to five years for possession of larger amounts and up to 14 years for those who supply or produce it. Faye - a campaigner for United Patients Alliance (UPA), which is calling for cannabis to be legally accessed by patients - has a raft of places she could start a new life. Medicinal cannabis is legal - or being legalised - in 25 US states, and in countries from Canada to Italy. \"But I'd rather not leave the country I was born in,\" she says. \"Mum would be devastated.\" Perhaps now she won't have to. A group of MPs has called on the government to legalise medical cannabis after publishing the results of a seven-month inquiry into medicinal use of the drug. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Drug Policy Reform took evidence from 623 patients, professionals and experts and more than 20,000 scientific and medical reports were reviewed. \"The results are clear. Cannabis has a medical benefit for a wide range of conditions,\" says Mike Barnes, a professor of neurological rehabilitation. However, the NHS warns that cannabis use carries a number of risks, such as impairing the ability to drive, as well as causing harm to lungs if smoked and harm to mental health, fertility or unborn babies. It can also have other serious consequences, with users potentially vulnerable to developing psychotic illnesses, the Royal College of Psychiatrists says. A Home Office spokesman said the government had no plan to legalise cannabis, adding: \"There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health.\" Yet the End Our Pain campaign, which supports the legalisation of medical cannabis, estimates that one million people across the UK rely on the drug for medical reasons. By Michelle Roberts, health editor, BBC News online. After weighing the evidence, experts say there is a clear therapeutic role for medical cannabis. There is good evidence that it helps alleviate the symptoms of chronic pain, MS and nausea associated with chemotherapy, as well as anxiety. But for treating other conditions, such as depression, headaches and epilepsy, there is limited or no convincing evidence that it works. Like any drug, cannabis can cause side effects. Smoking cannabis in a joint rolled with tobacco can make asthma worse and probably increases the risk of lung cancer. Regular cannabis use puts some people at increased risk of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, and can also reduce fertility. Cannabis is addictive and you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as cravings, difficulty sleeping, sweating and shaking. Cannabis affects how the brain works. It can make users feel very anxious and even paranoid, it can make it difficult to concentrate and learn. 37. average age of patient. 67%. try conventional medicines first. 37% don't tell their doctor. 72% buy street cannabis. 20% grow their own. The United Patients Alliance says 30% of cannabis patients surveyed by the APPG cited depression as a reason for self-medication - though patients reported multiple conditions and depression often accompanies other primary conditions. About a quarter of patients said they used the drug to combat anxiety and a quarter mentioned pain. Almost 70% of the patients surveyed said they had tried conventional medicines first, before turning to cannabis. Doctors told Faye she would have to take low dosages of cancer drugs for the rest of her life to deal with her rheumatoid arthritis. But after suffering hair loss, frequent sickness and \"brain fog\", her job became untenable and her boss took her aside. \"I'd just bought a house and had a mortgage - I couldn't afford to lose my job,\" she says. Inspired by MS patients, she tried cannabis and now spends about £250 a month making her own capsules and creams, mixing cannabis oil and coconut oil. Faye says she takes the pills \"like I would ibuprofen, when I need them\", claiming that the low dosage is not enough to make her high. Along with 38% of users surveyed by the APPG, she also uses a vaporiser to consume the drug. Fewer than a third smoke it with tobacco; one in five smokes it without tobacco. Others eat it, take capsules or use creams. MS patient Penny Fitzlyon, from London, said she was prescribed a variety of opiates which \"switched off all interest in the outside world\". She said they left her \"feeling grotty and miserable\", took away her sense of humour and made her constipated. \"Then after a second MRI scan, I overheard a nurse saying it wouldn't be long before I'd be in a wheelchair,\" she says. \"So I started doing my own research. Cannabis was the only thing I could find that hadn't killed anyone.\" Penny, 52, says she tracked down a herbalist who, unlike street sellers, knew how to mix different strains of cannabis for different patients. \"We want to get rid of street dealers,\" she says. \"Backstreet cannabis is not good - they mix it with sand or glass to make it look all sparkly and heavy.\" Some 72% of cannabis bought for medicinal use is purchased on the street or from friends, but 20% of users grow their own, in groups or by themselves. The remainder is sourced on the internet or abroad, according to those surveyed by the APPG. Penny, who has been cautioned by the police twice, estimates that she spends £5,000 a year on cannabis - a fraction of the £30,000 annual cost of MS prescription drugs, she says. Though she avoids \"getting stoned\", without small doses of the drug Penny finds simple tasks such as walking to the shops \"incredibly painful\". For Jon Liebling, from Reading, brushes with the law have only made him more determined to fight for the right to use cannabis as a medicine. A traumatic childhood, with a mother who attempted suicide and an absent father, left Jon anxious, depressed and struggling to concentrate at school. But after trying cannabis at university, he didn't look back. \"I knew it was illegal\", he says, \"But it just worked. All the pain and stress I'd carried in my back, shoulders and neck for years just went.\" But the 48-year-old's use of cannabis would see him arrested by the police three times - forcing him to leave university, drop out of a nurses' training course and finally land him in court for growing his own. Though the arrests led to no more than a slap on the wrist and a fine, he said they left him feeling \"angry and disenfranchised\". \"My life has been ruined by the law,\" he says. Now, as political director of the UPA, Jon says the conclusions of the parliamentary group are \"incredibly exciting\". \"I don't think judges really want to put people away for it,\" he says. \"I was really honest with the judge about my medical history and he was really sympathetic.\" Though Faye fears the police \"taking away her medicine\" or indeed sending her to prison, she says most people are \"very understanding\" - even potential employers. She says she has mentioned her End Our Pain campaigning in numerous job interviews \"and it never stopped me getting a second interview\". \"I'm cannabis proud,\" she says.",

Directors Anthony O'Sullivan, 47, and Martin Lincoln, 46, were given 24-week terms after admitting 12 offences. An investigation was launched in December 2013. In a statement, Newport city council said the pair were warned in 2010 that their company was not permitted to carry out turkey processing. However, it said records showed that large quantities of meat was sold by Severnside Provisions in 2011, 2012 and 2013. After an investigation started, environmental health officers found large quantities of turkey defrosting outside in dirty water and being processed in a garage in \"unhygienic conditions\". Items seized were destroyed but the Food Standards Agency launched a national recall after finding turkeys had already been sold to butchers' shops and restaurants. The council said O'Sullivan and Lincoln had admitted 12 food hygiene offences, including that they sold food that was unsafe and failed to keep equipment clean. As well as being jailed, the two directors were ordered to pay a confiscation award of £271,815 under the Proceeds of Crime Act and council costs of £35,185. The company was also fined £100,000. Newport councillor Bob Poole said: \"This company was putting people's health at serious risk for the sake of profit.\"",

    "document": "They said the Chinese authorities had never before reported this to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites). However, during the convention's standing committee meeting in Geneva, China reportedly said that it still banned tiger bones. \"A Chinese delegate said, 'we don't ban trade in tiger skins but we do ban trade in tiger bones,'\" a participant in the meeting said. Cites secretariat sources confirmed that a member of the Chinese delegation had said this. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told the BBC Chinese Service he could not verify the reported admission, but he said that China will \"investigate and combat\" any illegal trade in tiger skins. Between 5,000 and 6,000 tigers are believed to be in captivity in China. Wildlife conservation organisations have long demanded an end to the trade in skins. Wildlife experts believe \"tiger farming\" in China has fuelled demand for the poaching and trafficking of the endangered species elsewhere. They say the admission at the meeting will increase pressure on China to curb the practice. Reports also say that the facilities where the captive tigers are held have been providing live animals and parts for illegal international trade. According to officials and participants at the Cites meeting, the admission from China followed the presentation of a report which gave details of how the Chinese government had allowed commercial trade in skins from captive tigers. \"The report presented in the meeting created a situation that required China to respond,\" said a participant who did not wish to be named. \"Basically when the meeting focused on the findings of this report, the Chinese delegate intervened,\" he said. \"It was the first time they admitted officially that this trade exists in China.\" Participants say this created quite a sensation during the Cites meeting. \"After the Chinese intervention... we too intervened and made it clear that the investigations we have done with other organisations clearly show that the trade in China is happening on a commercial scale,\" said Shruti Suresh, a wildlife campaigner with the UK-based Environment Investigation Agency, which has investigated the illegal wildlife trade across the globe. \"The clarification was necessary because the Chinese delegate did not say that it was happening on a commercial scale, and there was a risk that the trade could later be misreported as something done for scientific research or, say, displays in the museums.\" Member countries of the Cites are required to report on what progress they have made to ensure that trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. A new report on illegal wildlife trade suggests that around 1,600 tigers, both from captivity and the wild, have been traded globally since 2000. While China has been a major market for tiger parts, wildlife experts say other South East Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Lao, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia are also emerging as consumers, where tiger farming is growing. Reports say that in the past two years, there have been seizures of nearly 90 tigers likely to have been sourced from, or trafficked through, captive facilities across South East Asia and China. \"Demand-reduction efforts and enforcement and anti-trafficking activities are undermined both by the existence of facilities that keep and breed tigers for commercial purposes, and the lack of enforcement to stop trade from or through them,\" says a report by Species Survival Network (SSN), whose members include more than 100 wildlife conservation organisations. \"Trade in these specimens perpetuated the desirability of tiger parts and China's experiment in licensing the domestic trade in skins of captive tigers has done nothing to alleviate pressure on wild tigers, as evidenced through continued poaching in the wild.\" A little more than 3,000 tigers are believed to be left in the wild across the globe. More than half of those are in India, where 42 tigers were killed last year. \"If the Chinese government has admitted the trade in tiger skins, I think it is a forward step toward curbing illegal trade in tiger parts,\" said SP Yadav, deputy inspector general of India's National Tiger Conservation Authority. \"Denial mode does not help solve the problem but once you accept what is happening, it's easy to move ahead.\" The SSN report says the skins of tigers, leopards and snow leopards are valued among the political, military and business elite as luxury home decorations in China. \"The outcome of recent corruption cases in China confirm they are 'gifted' as non-financial bribes to officials,\" the report says. In 2005, China had announced that it was considering re-opening the domestic trade in tiger bone from tiger breeding facilities. Two years later, Cites parties adopted a decision calling for the phasing out of such facilities.",

    "document": "It also defied predictions that it would not survive the collapse of its one-time supporter, the Soviet Union. Since the fall of the US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, Cuba has been a one-party state led by Mr Castro and - since February 2008 - by his chosen successor and younger brother, Raul. Fidel Castro exercised control over virtually all aspects of Cuban life through the Communist Party and its affiliated mass organisations, the government bureaucracy and the state security apparatus. Exploiting the Cold War, Fidel Castro was for decades able to rely on strong Soviet backing, including annual subsidies worth $4-5 billion, and succeed in building reputable health and education systems. But, at least partly because of the US trade sanctions, he failed to diversify the economy. The US and Cuba agreed in 2014 to normalise relations. Population 11.2 million. Area 110,860 sq km (42,803 sq miles) Major language Spanish. Major religion Christianity. Life expectancy 77 years (men), 81 years (women) Currency Cuban peso. Raul Castro, the world's longest-serving defence minister, took over as president in February 2008, succeeding his ailing brother Fidel, who had been in power for five decades. After being re-elected by the single-party National Assembly in February 2013, Raul announced his intention to stand down at the end of his second term in 2018. Fidel Castro brought revolution to Cuba in the 1950s and created the western hemisphere's first Communist state. His beard, long speeches, cigar, army fatigues and defiance of the United States earned him iconic status across the globe. Raul, 76 at the time of this appointment, has been his brother's trusted right-hand man and was once known as an iron-fisted ideologue who executed Fidel Castro's orders - and enemies - ruthlessly. Under his leadership, Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces became one of the most formidable fighting forces in the Third World with combat experience in Africa, where they defeated South Africa's army in Angola in 1987. The Cuban media are tightly controlled by the government and journalists must operate within the confines of laws against anti-government propaganda and the insulting of officials which carry penalties of up to three years in prison. Reporters without Borders in early 2016 described Cuba as \"one of the world's worst countries from the viewpoint of journalistsâ€¦ independent journalists and bloggers are constantly persecuted by the Castro government\". Some key dates in Cuba's history:. 1898 - Cuba is ceded to the US which defeated Spain in war. 1902 - Cuba becomes independent under the protection of the US. 1933 - Sergeant Fulgencio Batista seizes power in a coup. 1959 - Fidel Castro leads a guerrilla army into Havana, forcing Batista to flee. 1961 - US breaks off diplomatic relations in response to the nationalization of US-owned properties, and later imposes a complete commercial embargo. 1961 - Cuban exiles backed by the US try to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, but are defeated. 1962 - The US and the Soviet Union have a showdown that almost touches off war after the US discovers Soviet nuclear missiles on Cuba. The confrontation ends with the Soviets removing the missiles and the US agreeing never to invade Cuba. 1975 - Castro sends troops to Angola to help fight rebels backed by South Africa. It is the start of 15 years of war in which 300,000 Cubans will fight. 1991 - The Soviet Union, Cuba's biggest benefactor, collapses, touching off an economic crisis. 2006 - Fidel Castro provisionally turns over power to brother Raul Castro, who becomes president in 2008. 2014 - US President Barack Obama and President Castro announce moves to normalise diplomatic relations, severed for more than 50 years.",

    "document": "Batsman Root is the favourite to take over from Alastair Cook, who stepped down on Monday after a record 59 Tests. The Yorkshire player had been Test vice-captain to Cook since May 2015. \"Root is fairly quiet but he has got that fire in his belly. He's a really impressive young man,\" Anderson told The Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show. Should he be named captain aged 26, Root would be a year younger than Cook was when he took on the Test role on a full-time basis in August 2012. No batsman has scored more Test runs than Root's 4,594 since he made his debut on 13 December 2012, and only India captain Virat Kohli (8,536) has scored more runs than Root's 8,469 in all three forms of international cricket. Anderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, has played under five full-time Test captains since making his debut in May 2003. The 34-year-old has served Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Strauss and Cook, as well as Andrew Flintoff who deputised for several Tests in 2006 and 2007. \"Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak and he's a really impressive young man,\" explained Anderson. \"He's the obvious candidate. The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. While they do not play another Test until July, England then play seven home Test matches - against South Africa and West Indies - in three months, before travelling to Australia in November for the Ashes. Root scored 1,477 Test runs in 2016, making centuries against South Africa, Pakistan and India, as well as scoring 796 runs in one-day internationals and 297 in Twenty20 internationals. \"He loves cricket. It's very rare you see a player that's had the success he's had and he's not like that,\" Anderson said. \"In the brief period Alastair Cook's been off the field -  for bathroom breaks -  Root's been in there making changes. He's been good. \"It can be a difficult situation for a vice-captain when the captain goes off, you're in charge and myself and Stuart [Broad] might not make it that easy to go up and talk tactics. However he's done that and he's been good.\" Root has led Yorkshire four times in the County Championship, taking charge when the county secured the 2014 County Championship title after then-captain Andrew Gale was suspended. He was also the on-field captain when Middlesex, led by Australian batsman Chris Rogers, made a record 472-3 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in the same year. All-rounder Ben Stokes, who was vice-captain on the recent limited-overs tour of Bangladesh which regular ODI skipper Eoin Morgan missed, was described as a \"natural leader\" by his Durham skipper Paul Collingwood. \"Ben has got a natural draw to him and he would be an excellent vice-captain for Root,\" former England limited-overs captain Collingwood said on the Tuffers and Vaughan show. \"The captain will have leaders underneath him that he knows he can go to - I think Ben Stokes would be the perfect man for that.\" Fast bowler Stuart Broad has also been mooted - he captained the Twenty20 side between 2011 and 2014 - and Anderson said: \"I wouldn't be against a fast bowler but one issue could be fitness. \"Bowlers get injured a lot more so are they going to play every game? The international schedule is hectic so it can be difficult.\" Wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, who led the one-day side in Bangladesh in Morgan's absence and remains the official limited-overs vice-captain, has also been suggested as a possible candidate. However, the Lancashire player's Test place is not guaranteed given current keeper Jonny Bairstow's good form - although Buttler played as a specialist batsman in the last three Tests of the recent India series. Ex-England spinner Graeme Swann told BBC Radio 5 live he felt the pressure of potential Test captaincy was already affecting Root's batting. \"I think we should leave Joe Root to be the best batsman this country has ever produced, which he would be without the burden of being the captain,\" he said. However, Kohli, along with Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, have each raised their games since becoming captains of their respective countries. Smith and Kohli are the two top-ranked Test batsmen, while Williamson is one of 13 men to have scored a Test century against all of the other nine Test-playing nations. \"It's very English to assume the captaincy will affect him. The other three have got captaincy of their country and gone to a different level with it,\" said ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan, who came through the same Sheffield Collegiate club side and Yorkshire academy ranks which produced Root, and has been a long-term mentor to the young right-hander. \"I don't think there's an issue with him captaining, he's too good a player. I think he'd be a good one. \"To captain any team you have to be loving the game, love the difficult moments and prove people wrong. He is that kind of character.\" England and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was named captain of the county in December 2016, said that his team-mate Root's inexperience was not an issue in him assuming the captaincy. The pair lived together in 2011 during their early years in the Yorkshire first team and Ballance took Root's place when he was dropped for the final Test of England's Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14. \"I think both of us have probably matured a bit more as cricketers and people. He's ready as a leader now in that England changing room,\" Ballance told BBC World Service's Stumped programme. \"I think Rooty's a natural born leader. He's done it from a young age. People follow him. \"He speaks well, he's got a great cricket brain. I don't think inexperience is too much of a problem. He'll be ready if he gets the opportunity.\"",

Mr Khan is one of Bollywood's biggest stars and has starred in more than 80 Hindi-language films. Several of his films, including Dabangg, Ready, Bodyguard, Ek Tha Tiger, Maine Pyar Kiya and Hum Aap Ke Hain Kaun, have been huge commercial hits. Late on the night of 28 September 2002, his Toyota Land Cruiser hit the American Express bakery in the Bandra area of Mumbai, authorities say. The vehicle ran over five people sleeping on the street, killing 38-year-old Noor Ullah Khan and seriously injuring three others. Another person received minor injuries. The prosecution has alleged that Mr Khan was driving the car and that he was drunk. In March the actor told the court he was not drunk and was not driving the car. But many witnesses have said that was not the case. A constable attached to Mr Khan's security said in a statement to the police that the \"drunk\" actor had lost control of the car. The policeman died in 2007 of tuberculosis. In April, Mr Khan's driver told the court that he had crashed the car after a tyre burst. At the scene, Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Mumbai.

Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed Arif is the officer in charge of the area, and saw his headquarters collapse before his eyes. \"My residence is on a small hill. From there, I saw the shockwave ripping through the town and destroying houses with it.\" \"It was a terrible sight which I can never forget.\" Officials estimate that about 80% of the houses in the Mashkel area collapsed - either partially or completely - in the quake. Army helicopters have been delivering tents from the provincial capital, Quetta. But we saw family after family sitting amid the ruins of their mud-brick houses under open skies with no shelter. Mashkel social worker Lareef Baloch says that most houses in the town are uninhabitable. \"The structures still standing are dangerous because they have cracks in them,\" he told the BBC. \"We see army helicopters flying in and out of town, but we haven't received any tents, blankets, medicines or food.\" The relief operation has been hampered by the remoteness of the affected area. The road journey from Quetta to Mashkel is long and dangerous. Since Tuesday, small aftershocks have continued to hit the area. One survivor told the BBC that he was traumatised by the experience and now has difficulty sleeping at night. The Pakistani army says it has tried its best in the rescue and relief effort. But an army spokesman told the BBC that people of the area will need help from national and international aid groups in the rehabilitation and reconstruction process in the weeks ahead. It could be that ties on the ground will also play a role in providing help to quake victims. Residents of Mashkel have close ties with ethnic Balochs in Iran's Sistan province. Many people have families and relatives on both sides of the border. The town's economy depends on oil smuggling from Iran and the annual date harvest. The BBC saw several vehicles with Iranian registration plates being used to transport people on sandy tracks. When the earthquake struck this week, many people preferred to take their injured across the border to the city of Zahidan in Sistan province. The Iranian authorities were quick to relax border movements to facilitate the relief effort. The road journey from Mashkel to Zahidan takes a few hours, compared with  the 15 to 18 hours it takes to reach Balochistan's capital, Quetta.

But experts are worried that creating national parks often involves removing the people who live in these areas. The study indicated designating forest reserves in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo could displace as many as 1.3 million people. With funding from Norway, Liberia has proposed 30% of their forests become protected areas by 2020. DR Congo, funded by Germany and the Global Environmental Facility, aims to set aside 12-15% of their forested lands. Consultants TMP Systems concluded:. \"Governments have targets to expand their protected areas, and now with new climate funding being available the risk is they will use this to expand in a way that doesn't respect local rights,\" said Andy White, from the Rights and Resources Initiative, the campaign group that sponsored the research. \"It could result in the displacement of millions of people.\" Analysts say that this type of displacement has already happened in sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and Latin America, and sometimes caused violent conflict. \"I don't think the international community wants to displace rural dwellers in Liberia - but I think if we go about it in the way we are talking about it right now, that is going to be the result,\" said Constance Teague, from Liberia's Sustainable Development Institute. \"We need to recognise that indigenous communities respect the forest and they have worked on [it] for hundreds of years. \"It may not look like what the international community may expect, but this effort to conserve the land does exist.\" Liberia had the largest forest space left in West Africa, largely because of the indigenous communities, she added. The report also looks into the costs of compensating people for the loss of their lands in both Liberia and DR Congo, which range from $200m (Â£137m) to more than Â£1bn. The main argument for setting up reserves is to:. And Mr White said: \"We need to make evidence available that makes it clear that the woods are full of people, and it makes more sense to help them rather than kick them out. \"Where indigenous peoples rights are protected, and they are able to use their forests for their own livelihoods, they have more carbon per hectare than protected areas. \"They are active protectors, you don't have to pay a park guard, because they protect their forests, and that is what the world needs.\" Some 1.5 billion indigenous people inhabit or claim most of the land in the world - but, according to a study released last year, they have legal rights to just 10%.

    "document": "The introduction of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, however, means that even if she wants to, Mrs May might not find it so easy. The Act was introduced after the 2010 election to bind together the two parts of the new coalition government. The discretion of prime ministers to pick the timing of elections was removed and the dates fixed five years apart - we are next due one on Thursday 7 May 2020. The Act provides two mechanisms by which an early election could be triggered, which are:. Taking each in turn, the government does not have the numbers on its own to achieve a two-thirds majority so any vote would depend on what the other parties do. Jeremy Corbyn has warned the Labour Party to prepare for an election next year and Newsnight reported in September that he planned to instruct his MPs to vote in favour of an early election if the government wanted to call one (although that has not been confirmed). Latest polls suggest that supporting an early election would be a mistake for Labour. It is unlikely the Scottish National Party would come to the government's assistance in bringing about an early election. Looking at the second mechanism, if other parties do not support an early election it would be unprecedented in British politics for a government to bring about its own downfall (though such engineering is not unknown elsewhere) and the government voting no confidence in itself could be a risky strategy. More likely is that the Fixed Term Parliaments Act could be repealed or amended, to require, for example, a simple majority of MPs in favour of an early election, though the House of Lords may have something to say about this. An amendment to existing legislation seems more straightforward than trying to reintroduce the prerogative power to call elections. In short, the calling of an early election would require either a change in the law, or some unusual parliamentary gymnastics.",

The loss was in line with investors' expectations, and the announcement that it was increasing production sent its shares up 4% in after-hours trading. Tesla had been struggling to ramp up production of its cars including its newest Model X SUV. Production of the Model X rose from 507 in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2,659 in the first quarter of 2016. The company confirmed it was on track to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 electric vehicles this year. Tesla said it had seen demand rise across all its models, especially its Model 3 - the carmaker's first mass-market product. Deliveries of the Model 3 are due to hit the market in 2017 and the company received 325,000 orders for the car within a week of announcing it. This could result in $14bn in future sales. To meet that demand Tesla has cut two years off its timeline for ramping up production. \"Increasing production five-fold over the next two years will be challenging and will likely require some additional capital, but this is our goal,\" chief executive Elon Musk said in a latter to investors.

In its UK Bioenergy Strategy, published in April 2012, the coalition government placed high importance on the role biomass can play, warning that excluding it from the energy mix would \"significantly increase the cost of decarbonising our energy system - an increase estimated by recent analysis at Â£44bn\". However, it added that ministers had a responsibility to ensure that \"policies only supported bioenergy use in the right circumstances\". The strategy document outlined four guiding principles that would underpin policy decisions, one of which stated:. The UK introduced the Climate Change Act 2008, which obliges governments to deliver an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emission from 1990 levels by 2050. Experts agree that in order for this target to be met, the UK's energy infrastructure must drastically cut its carbon footprint. Outdoor laboratory. In a Lincolnshire field, a team of scientists led by researchers from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) carried out a range of experiments on two bioenergy crops: miscanthus grass and short-rotation coppice willow. Natural England's guide to miscanthus (PDF) In their outdoor laboratory, they set out to measure how much atmospheric carbon the crops were able to lock in the soil. \"The big barrier as far as bioenergy crops are concerned is a fear of the unknown in terms of soil carbon losses or gains - this is the gap we are trying to fill,\" explained lead researcher Niall McNamara. \"At this field site, we are very lucky to have two key bioenergy crops growing side-by-side, which is allowing us to make a comparison of their effects on soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from the soil,\" he told BBC News. One of the experiments involves erecting three-metre high tents over a section of the crops, allowing the team to expose the plants to a \"carbon tracer\" - a form of carbon that is different from atmospheric carbon so it is possible for the researchers to track its movements from the surrounding air, through the plants and into the soil. \"This is added through the tent for about four to five hours,\" said Dr McNamara. \"During this time, it is fixed by the plants through photosynthesis. We then follow that carbon which has been fixed by the plant into the soil and into the microbes and back out of the soil.\" He added that the experiment would provide data on how novel crops, such as miscanthus, introduced carbon into the soil and how stable it was once it was in the ground. \"As you can see, miscanthus is very different from anything you would see normally,\" he observed. \"It originates from Asia and so there has not been a lot of work done on it and the carbon tracer approach is a very good way of seeing how much carbon fixed by the plant will stay in the soil a year later.\" Another experiment the team are carrying out involves taking a metre-deep soil sample, which co-researcher Rebecca Rowe describes as \"quite unusual\". \"A lot of soil science, at the moment, is done to about 30cm, partly for practical reasons as coring to a metre is difficult,\" she said. Digging deep. In order to extract the metre-long sample, the team have to enlist the help of \"Kevin\", an adapted road-breaker. \"Also because a lot of arable crops or grassland crops the rooting depths are much shallower, a lot of the changes are happening in the top 30cm,\" Dr Rowe told BBC News. \"Obviously, with energy crops that are in the ground for 20-25 years, we are looking at a lot longer timescale and a greater depth for rooting so it is important for us to go deeper.\" Dr Rowe is 12 months into a three-year project that involves collecting metre soil samples all over the UK. \"We could just do it here at our Lincolnshire site, but then we would only be able to say what is happening with soil carbon in this location in this soil type,\" she explained. \"By going all over the country, we can look at different soil types and different climates - the South-West is very different  to, say, southern Scotland. \"It gives us a much better idea of what the overall effect on soil carbon may be in all of the sites across the UK with growing things like willow, miscanthus and different arable crops as well.\" (Source: UK Bioenergy Strategy) Dr McNamara said the data would be used to develop a model, developed by researchers from Aberdeen University and other partners, to show how growing bioenergy crops would affect an area of land's soil carbon characteristics. \"Our plan is to make a model universally available to the community, so a user could download our model and then - for example - predict what would happen if they converted their land to bioenergy crops in terms of the implication for soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said. The project - commissioned and funded by the Energy Technologies Institute, with additional funding from the Natural Environment Research Council - would, Dr McNamara added, help address the concern over the scarcity of data on bioenergy crops and carbon cycling, and allow policymakers make informed decisions about the role bioenergy can play in delivering a low carbon UK energy mix.",

Her boyfriend Kyrron Jackson, 28, and his friend Nicholas Chandler, 29, were found guilty of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years. Granger targeted Mehmet Hassan, 56, in a Mayfair casino in March last year. Judge William Kennedy described the attack as \"pitiless and wicked\", adding: \"It was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion.\" Granger's lawyer Orlando Pownall said she only took part in the plot as she was in love with Jackson and \"fell in with his desires\" and now \"deeply regretted\" her actions. \"Her head was turned by Jackson, who she loved, and to some extent by Chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming,\" he said. But Judge Kennedy said she had been \"deceitful from the outset\" and had \"lost her sense and compassion\" when she got involved. He added that she clearly cared more for Jackson than he cared for her. Granger, who posed under the name of Rachel, was wined and dined by the divorced father of three who boasted to friends he was not paying her to be with him, the court heard earlier. On the night he was killed, Mr Hassan had taken Granger to the upmarket Nobu restaurant before giving her Â£1,000 to gamble with at the nearby Palm Beach Casino. The two were seen kissing passionately by a poker supervisor, before leaving the casino together for Mr Hassan's flat in Islington. Granger then let Jackson and Chandler into the poker player's flat before leaving in a taxi. Both men tied up Mr Hassan with parcel tape and a neck tie before kicking and stamping him to death, the trial was told. Afterwards, while he lay dead in a pool of blood, all three were filmed on Granger's mobile phone throwing Â£50 notes around a room and even stuffing  them in their underpants. Commenting on the footage, Judge Kennedy told the three defendants: \"The eloquence with which it speaks about you is deafening.\"",

    "document": "Surprise frontrunner Francois Fillon said his project was \"more radical\", and vowed to implement sweeping changes in the first three months of his term. Alain Juppe insisted his proposals were \"deep and credible\" but lacked the \"brutality\" of Mr Fillon's plans. It was the final Republicans party debate before Sunday's concluding vote. The Republicans candidate is widely expected to face far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen in a runoff vote in the presidential election next May. Self-declared supporters of the centre-right values are choosing between the two former prime ministers. It is the party's first such primary vote, modelled on the US system. Seven candidates were whittled down to two last Sunday, with Mr Fillon taking an unexpectedly decisive lead of 44.1% to Mr Juppe's 28.5%. Juppe v Fillon: Battle of France's conservatives. Press review: France's 'Mr Nobody' Francois Fillon. Fillon under fire over women's rights. The past week has seen a campaign marked by a bitter row over the nature Mr Fillon's social policies. Mr Juppe provoked a furious reaction when he questioned whether Mr Fillon, a Roman Catholic, could seek to challenge the legality of abortion. But polling suggests such tactics seem to have backfired on Mr Juppe, once the favourite seen as the safe choice. A poll of 908 debate viewers by Elabe suggested 71% of conservative respondents found Mr Fillon more convincing, as did 57% of viewers of all political stripes. \"It is true that my project is more radical and perhaps more difficult,\" said Mr Fillon. His controversial economic reforms include cutting half a million public sector jobs and scrapping the 35-hour work week, prompting comparisons to the late British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Mr Juppe also proposes cutting jobs and liberalising work hours, though to a lesser extent. Both propose roughly similar cuts to public spending of at least â‚¬100bn (Â£85bn; $106bn). \"I've got a plan for the reforms I want to make in the first three months of the presidential term - and I'm convinced if we don't get these changes implemented in the first three months, the French people will feel disheartened, they'll turn away from politics, and then there'll be a greater risk of the extremists winning,\" Mr Fillon said. The country was \"on the brink of revolt\", which could only be averted with such radical action. Conservative Le Figaro says the debate \"eased tensions on the right\" and showed the two contenders \"have already formed identical visions and almost similar projects\" - in particular the need to end the \"vicious cycle of spending and debt\". They have \"some differences on security, education and migration, but they are minor\", concludes its political editor. But centre-left Le Monde's political correspondent disagrees, seeing \"significant differences\" on the European Union, Russia and Syria. While Mr Fillon wants to \"respect the sovereignty\" of EU member states, Mr Juppe favours a \"powerful EU as a future world power\". On Syria, Mr Fillon wants to put France \"back in play\" by \"opening a channel to Damascus\", whereas Mr Juppe wants to \"boost transatlantic co-operation\" and takes a firm line against President Bashar al-Assad, Le Monde says. Left-wing Liberation writes that the debate between \"Fillon the radical and Juppe the reconciler\" was \"knotty, often tense, but not aggressive\". It thought Mr Juppe managed to score points over his opponent on some issues, but \"not enough to trouble the winner of the first round\". BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world. You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook. Mr Juppe hit back at Mr Fillon, saying \"reform should not be a punishment but bring hope\". \"The French social model exists, I want to consolidate it... not break it,\" Mr Juppe said, referring to the welfare system. Mr Juppe pledged to bring unity and stability to the presidency - whose current Socialist incumbent, Francois Hollande, has seen his popularity drop to historic lows. He said he would choose a \"loyal\" PM and 15 \"durable\" cabinet ministers who would not \"change every 18 months\".",

He then broke down in tears as he dedicated his award to the victims of the Paris terror attacks. The musician spent his early 20s living in the city, and busked on the metro as a struggling musician. He told BBC News he had returned to Paris last weekend to support friends who had been caught up in the tragedy. Reflecting on the Mercury Prize, he said: \"I always believed in my music but after Paris happened, I was very down. \"I didn't think I would win. I always wanted to be nominated for this award, but I didn't think to myself that I'd win it. I always made a joke about it!\" The musician's debut album is a searingly-personal collection of piano-based songs, which critics have called \"bold\", \"brilliant\" and \"astonishing\". It touches on his turbulent upbringing in Edmonton, London, as well as the three years he spent sleeping rough in Paris. \"I made this album thinking only about 50 people would listen to it,\" he told the BBC. \"My music isn't mainstream music. \"It goes to show that you've just got to be sincere in your work and people will listen to it.\" The Mercury Prize recognises innovative albums produced in the UK and Ireland.

Four officers have been placed on administrative leave. The wounded man's name and age have not been released by police. But the St Louis Post-Dispatch identified him as 18-year-old Tyrone Harris, having spoken to his father, the paper said. The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson by white police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014 sparked demonstrations across the United States. Although Mr Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing by a grand jury and by the US Department of Justice, the teenager's death fuelled a national protest movement against the use of excessive force by police officers. A justice department investigation also found widespread racial bias in the Ferguson police force. What happened in Ferguson in 2014? US Dept of Justice report on Ferguson racism. Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of people stood silent for four-and-a-half minutes at the spot where Michael Brown was killed, representing the number of hours that his body lay in the street unattended. The BBC's Aleem Maqbool, who is in Ferguson, says most people at Sunday's gathering felt little had changed since Michael Brown was shot dead a year ago. At the end of a sombre, peaceful day of commemorations, shots were heard at about 23:15 local time on Sunday (04:15 Monday GMT) as a large crowd gathered on West Florissant Avenue,. St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters that after \"an exchange of gunfire between two groups\" the suspect, believed by police to be armed, left and encountered officers in an unmarked SUV. He said the suspect fired on the vehicle and the plainclothes detectives returned fire from inside the van. There was then a further exchange of fire after the officers left the vehicle. The gunmen \"were criminals; they weren't protesters,\" he said, adding that the officers were not wearing body cameras. Photos from the scene showed a young black man lying bloodied on the ground. He was face down and handcuffed. President Barack Obama announced a federal programme to help pay for lapel-mounted cameras for US police to record their interactions in the wake of the nationwide protests on perceived policing injustices. There have been a number of high profile shootings of unarmed black men in US cities in recent months.

Sergeant Seydou Koné said they did not want to negotiate with anyone, according to Reuters news agency. The unrest began after a spokesman for the soldiers announced on Thursday that they had dropped their pay demands. In January, they forced the government into paying them about $8,000 (£6,200) each in bonuses to end a rebellion. They were due to receive a further payment this month and about 8,000 mutineers are unhappy that they were not consulted ahead of Thursday's televised announcement. Three former rebels from the country's civil war era were wounded on Saturday after the mutinous soldiers opened fire in Bouaké to stop them staging their own protest, Sergeant Koné said. There have also been reports of injuries after shooting in the northern city of Korhogo. The military chief of staff, General Sékou Touré, had threatened \"severe disciplinary sanctions\" on Friday if the uprising did not end. Shops are closed and soldiers are patrolling and firing in the air in Bouaké, residents said. The mutineers have also taken control of the city of Odienne, in the north, reports say. On Friday, shots were fired in the air at military bases in Abidjan, Bondoukou in the east, Bouaké in the centre, and Korhogo. It is believed the mutineers were firing blanks. In response, elite Republican Guard troops in Abidjan fired warning shots that pushed the mutineers back inside the military headquarters compound in Abidjan, Reuters reported. The situation in the city on Saturday was said to be calm. Reacting to the spreading unrest, President Alassane Ouattara held an emergency meeting of the country's security council. The mutiny has raised fears of a resurgence of the violence seen during Ivory Coast's 10-year civil war, which ended in 2011.

The aviation historian said they had unearthed internal parts of the Rolls-Royce engine and plates inscribed with information, such as manufacturing details. \"The cockpit door was a bit of a surprise,\" he said. \"The last person to use it was Flt Lt Gordon Hayter Proctor who was later declared missing while serving in Burma. \"He has no grave and now he will be remembered in a bit of Monaghan. The display will be homage to him.\" He added that the team would love to make contact with any of his family members. Mr McNee said they knew more than 90% of the plane had been taken away at the time and probably scrapped. \"We had done our research and by looking at the Irish Army military archives, we knew that a substantial amount of the plane was taken away,\" he said. \"Back in September we applied for and were granted a licence to use ground-penetrating radar which detected the impact crater and showed sizable metallic remains.\" Pupils from three schools - two in Monaghan and one in County Londonderry - had been invited to help out at the dig, which also attracted the attention of many locals. Josie McCusker, who remembers seeing the Spitfire fall from the sky all those years ago, stayed for the entire duration of the dig. \"It was the morning, a Sunday morning and I remember the loud noise of it,\" she told BBC Radio Ulster. \"My father was milking cows in the byre and he heard the noise and he ran into the house thinking it was on fire. \"We then discovered it was a plane - it took the tops off the trees and a piece of it fell down in a gooseberry bush behind the house. \"I remember much of the plane being removed by the Army, and remember seeing it on a lorry.\" The job now is to clean, sort, identify and catalogue the items before handing them to the County Monaghan Museum, which will then be able to claim it has artefacts from the only Battle of Britain Spitfire to be legally excavated in Ireland.",

Home Secretary Theresa May and French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve will tour the Eurotunnel site and meet aid associations helping migrants. They will also discuss humanitarian support for migrants. Neither government has given full details of what the deal will involve. Thousands of migrants are living around Calais - many of them in the camp known as the Jungle - and each night hundreds attempt to reach the UK by breaching security around the port and Eurotunnel. After the meeting with Mrs May, Mr Cazeneuve will travel to Berlin to meet his German counterpart for talks on Europe's migration policies. The UK government has offered France help with security around Calais - including Â£7m for fences - but police there have said such measures are only a \"short-term solution\". The Calais situation is part of a much larger migration issue in Europe. More than 240,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean already this year, arriving on the shores of Greece and Italy. Meanwhile, it has been suggested that the number of refugees seeking asylum in Germany could surge to 750,000 this year - and a UN High Commissioner has said more European countries should share the responsibility.",

A spokesman for Palm Beach Gardens police in Florida confirmed to the BBC they were investigating a fatal crash involving the Grand Slam champion. A man was taken to hospital after the accident on 9 June and died two weeks later from his injuries, he said. According to TMZ, which broke the story, police believe the seven-time Grand Slam champion was at fault. But a lawyer for Williams said it was an \"unfortunate accident\". The man who died, Jerome Barson, was travelling with his wife who was driving their vehicle through an intersection when the accident happened. Williams' car suddenly darted into their path and was unable to clear the junction in time due to traffic jams, according to witness statements in a police report obtained by US media. Mrs Barson was also taken to hospital but survived. \"[Williams] is at fault for violating the right of way of [the other driver],\" the report said, adding that there were no other factors like drugs, alcohol or mobile phone distractions. The 37-year-old tennis star reportedly told police she did not see the couple's car and she was driving slowly. Police spokesman Major Paul Rogers said police were investigating whether the incident was connected to Mr Barson's death. Williams' lawyer Malcolm Cunningham told CNN in a statement: \"Ms Williams entered the intersection on a green light. The police report estimates that Ms Williams was travelling at 5mph when Mrs Barson crashed into her. \"Authorities did not issue Ms Williams with any citations or traffic violations.

The move was set in motion in 2013 with a law that fully legalised the cannabis trade. However, it has been a slow process to put the law into practice. \"Cannabis will be dispensed in pharmacies starting in the month of July,\" presidential aide Juan Andres Roballo told a press conference. The law requires buyers to sign up to a national registry, which Mr Roballo said would be up and running by 2 May. The price will be US$1.30 (£1) per gram.

The law also allows users to grow their own at home, or join  cooperative clubs that farm it. Many pharmacists have doubted the financial benefits of selling a cost-controlled product. Some Uruguayan buyers were also reluctant to sign up to a national registry, complaining of the invasion of their privacy and of having to keep to the monthly limits. The government has now done a deal with 16 pharmacies, but it hopes to sign up more. Mr Roballo said there would be a public health campaign before the registry was opened.

Mrs Merkel said she wanted friendly relations with both countries as well as Russia but Europe now had to \"fight for its own destiny\". Her comments come after Mr Trump refused to re-commit to the 2015 Paris climate deal at the G7 summit. Mrs Merkel is on the campaign trail ahead of elections in September. \"The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I've experienced that in the last few days,\" Mrs Merkel told a crowd at an election rally in Munich, southern Germany. The relationship between Berlin and new French President Emmanuel Macron had to be a priority, Mrs Merkel said, adding: \"We Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands.\" On Saturday, the German leader had described climate change talks at the G7 group of rich nations as \"very unsatisfactory\". Leaders from the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan had re-affirmed their support for the Paris accord - but Mr Trump said he would make a decision in the coming week. Mr Trump has previously pledged to abandon the Paris deal, and expressed doubts about climate change. Speaking in Brussels last week, Mr Trump also told Nato members to spend more money on defence and did not re-state his administration's commitment to Nato's mutual security guarantees. Mrs Merkel's latest comments are partly a move to appeal to German voters first and foremost, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. Polls suggest Mrs Merkel is on course to be re-elected for a fourth term as German chancellor at elections in September. It might have been thanks to the beer, pretzels and Bavarian brass-band enlivening the crowd. But Mrs Merkel's words were uncharacteristically passionate and unusually forthright. By all means keep friendly relations with Trump's America and Brexit Britain, was the message - but we can't rely on them. Rapturous applause greeted her fiery calls for Europeans to fight for their own destiny. No wonder she's sounding confident. France has a new president who shares her pro free-trade, Europhile values, so there is a positive feeling in Europe that the EU's Franco-German motor is back in business. With four months to go before elections, Angela Merkel's position also looks stronger than ever domestically. Initial enthusiasm for her centre-left rival Martin Schulz has fizzled out. And Sunday's beer-tent event underscored her strength by marking an end to a potential split with her Bavarian sister conservative party. She might not have welcomed Brexit or Trump. But it seems that Mrs Merkel has decided that standing up for the EU will only strengthen her chances of winning another term in September.",

But current Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said \"devolution has moved forward\" since the election. Significant powers had been handed to Scotland and councils, he added. MPs were debating the UK government's Wales Bill - to transfer further powers from Westminster to Cardiff Bay. Earlier another Conservative, Brecon and Radnorshire MP Chris Davies, had told BBC Wales he could \"see my first rebellion against the government will be coming\" over the referendum issue. Asked if other Tory MPs would join him in a rebellion, he said: \"I personally feel there will be.\" Addressing Mr Cairns in the Commons later Mr Davies he said he was \"personally very disappointed that in this clause we have broken a manifesto commitment and I would ask if you, who stood on the same manifesto, are equally as disappointed that you are breaking this commitment?\" Mr Cairns replied: \"First of all it was the 2014 [Government of Wales] Act that devolved tax varying powers to the assembly. \"This bill will go one step further by removing the requirement for a referendum. \"But what I would say - the second point I would say - is that devolution has moved forward since that time and we can either seek to have the hollow argument about rowing back or we can make the Welsh Government more accountable, more responsible for the money which it raises.\" Later Clwyd West MP Mr Jones intervened: \"Is it not the case that only just over 12 months ago the Conservative Party fought on a manifesto which pledged that there would be a referendum before any tax carrying competence was devolved to the assembly?\" Mr Cairns responded: \"You will recognise how quickly the devolution make up of the UK has developed, evolved and matured over that time. \"And this is the next logical step to making an assembly more mature, to making it more responsible, but ultimately making it more accountable to the people of Wales.\" Opening the debate , the minister said the Wales Bill would \"end the squabbles between Cardiff Bay and Westminster\". He later confirmed AMs would also be able to make voting in assembly elections compulsory, a power transfer welcomed by Labour Ynys Mon MP Albert Owen as \"radical\" and \"excellent\". Mr Davies wrote a letter to the Chancellor George Osborne with Tory backbench colleagues Byron Davies, David Davies, James Davies and David Jones after his Autumn Statement in November urging him to reverse plans to devolve the tax powers without a referendum. Under existing law AMs can call a referendum on powers to vary income tax, but in 2015 Mr Osborne offered those powers without a referendum. The Wales Bill also makes substantial changes to the way the assembly makes law by defining, for the first time, the areas that are in the hands of Westminster. It also grants new powers for AMs and Welsh ministers, including speed limits, control over fracking, the name of the assembly and elections to the Senedd.

    "document": "More than 60 years on, with another World Cup looming in Brazil and the Indian economy booming, there are renewed hopes that football can finally gain a toehold in the cricket-loving country. Qualification for the 2014 World Cup may be a step too far, but there are a number of initiatives under way to boost the sport. The challenges are to nurture that growing interest while wooing fans away from watching overseas football on TV,  and the need to create a strong national league and international team. Off the pitch there is the need to build football industry and infrastructure, while boosting the expertise of administrators and coaching and other backroom staff. \"There is a challenge from cricket, which gets the most investment,\" admits Kushal Das, general secretary of the All India Football Federation (AIFF). \"Many youngsters though are now watching a lot of football, mainly European leagues. \"We need to develop interest in the Indian leagues, and we need development programmes for that.\" Mr Das said he was encouraged by the recent visit of Fifa president Sepp Blatter to the country. The country is hoping to host the Under-17 World Cup in 2017, and Mr Blatter has so far offered encouraging noises. Mr Das said that highlights over the past couple of years included India playing in the AFC Asian Cup in 2011 for the first time in more than 20 years, and the 15-year commercial and marketing partnership between the AIFF and IMG-Reliance. Encouragement has also come from a recent development plan for football in India drawn up with Fifa. \"We are starting up academies for player development in four cities by July and another four by July 2013, for different age groups,\" says Mr Das. A technical director has also been appointed for the first time, unusual as it may seem that such a role did not exist before. \"We are looking not just at player development, but also administration, education, referees,\" says Mr Das. \"If we are successful in hosting the Under-17 there will be [business] opportunities, to participate in the whole development of Indian football - it is a great opportunity.\" He adds: \"The biggest challenge is infrastructure. I hope, if we have the World Cup hosting rights, that there will be serious efforts to improve the infrastructure.\" IMG and stadium builders Populous have already been around the country looking at which existing stadiums could potentially be brought up to scratch for 2017. One of the footballing hotbeds in the country is Pune, a city in the west of the country with a three million-plus population. \"Sport, including football, is tremendously popular among the youth of our city today,\" says Vishwajeet Kadam,  president of Pune District Football Association. \"We don't only focus on the skills development of players. We also taking to the FA and taking advice from the Indian Premier League cricket, and hockey, about ways to boost the football industry and surrounding football industry skills.\" Pune also has contacts with English Premier League football clubs, including Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers, who both have training academies in the city. \"Other clubs have been to India to just hold training sessions, but Liverpool has shown a clear commitment,\" says Mr Kadam. \"Most European clubs seriously underestimate the Indian market. \"There are organisations in India ready to spend money in partnerships with European clubs.\" One club which has formed a partnership is Italian side Inter Milan, which has entered a joint football venture with Tata Tea to support a youth football tournament in India, covering 15 cities, 1,000 schools, and one million children. Mario de Vivo, Inter Milan chief commercial officer, adds: \"We then select 16 young Indian pupils and take them to Inter Milan training academy for three days. \"We are bringing to India not only technical skills, but also medical, nutritional, and psychological support. \"We are able to offer a complete platform to help young teams, federations, and other people that want to learn about football and improve the professional side.\" Business bodies in India also wants to improve transparency, accountability, marketing, planning and professionalism in football. Rajpal Singh of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) says: \"We realise in sport we need foreign expertise. \"We want to create a sporting culture in India, and bring about attitudinal change and develop a sporting infrastructure. \"India is a cricket country but over the past two years you can see a change in attitude. Sports people are now looking towards football. \"But we need to examine the whole football infrastructure.\" IMG-Reliance is bringing its sports industry expertise to India as part of its deal with the AIFF. \"Indians love football and can play football. If you buy into that premise then you know we will be successful,\" says IMG's Jefferson Slack. Mr Slack admits there are challenges on the football and infrastructure side, but says there is a competitive media market in India that is \"going to need high quality football content\". He adds: \"There are certainly some challenges. The existing league suffers from anâ€¦ organisation standpoint. \"The IPL [cricket] was instructive because it showed that a properly constructed franchise league could work. \"There is a lot of money in India to build a brand. Football needs to succeed. It needs a plan. We are are not there yet. \"But the long term view we have is that this will be lucrative.\" Meanwhile, uncertainty remains about the future of the proposed, but currently delayed, Premier Soccer League (PLS) in West Bengal. The PLS was intended as a state league for older European players - such as Robert Pires and Fabio Cannavaro. It attracted publicity around the world, particularly in the UK. Mr Slack said he understood the premise of the league as, he says, India is a country that is \"star driven\". But he said there was a pressing need to boost the status of the current Indian national soccer league. \"We are in dialogue with I-League about how to make the league more competitive and attractive,\" he says. \"There are no easy solutions there. We completely understand that the clubs need to get more out of it.\"",

The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained \"absolutely committed\" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. \"Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',\" he said. \"Their judgement did, however, require us to change the provisions relating to information sharing. \"Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. \"I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people.\" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were \"not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament\". And they said the legislation made it \"perfectly possible\" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a \"wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware\". The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust.

Serious or repeat offences can now be punished by a points deduction, expulsion or relegation. Jeffrey Webb, head of Fifa's anti-racism task force, said the decision was \"a defining moment\". He added: \"Our football family is fully aware that what is reported in the media is actually less than 1% of the incidents that happen around the world. \"We've got to take action so that when we look to the next 20 or 50 years this will be the defining time that we took action against racism and discrimination.\" Fifa, world football's governing body, passed the anti-racism resolution with a 99% majority at its congress in Mauritius. Richard Conway, reporting for BBC Sport at the congress, said a concern was raised over those who voted against the tougher racism measures. \"Former South African apartheid prisoner Tokyo Sexwale, now a Fifa member, urged congress to check cameras to see who voted against racism rules,\" he said. \"Sexwale says (the) 1% vote against demonstrates how football still has to fight against racism.\" Webb said of the vote against the measures: \"I would like to think it was a mistake but I'm glad it wasn't the other way. I'm glad only 1% went that way.\" Nonetheless, Fifa president Blatter accepted more must be done to eradicate racism. He said: \"We need zero tolerance and strict punishments everywhere. We must lead. We must set a tough, uncompromising example. \"We can make a difference. We can send a strong signal to the racists that their time is up.\" Fifa commissioned a task force to address the issue of racism after a friendly game between AC Milan and Pro Patria was abandoned due to racist chanting. Their verdict includes putting an official inside the stadium to identify potential acts of racism and ease the pressure on the match referee. The new rulings standardise punishment across the members, meaning federations will lose the power to impose their own judgements. Further to the regulations that relate to clubs or international teams, the new measures will see any individual who commits a racist offence banned from stadiums for a minimum of five matches. The five-match suspension is one that has been introduced by the Football Association, whose chairman David Bernstein sat on the task force in Mauritius. Also on the task force was Kevin-Prince Boateng, the AC Milan player who led the walk-off in the game against Pro Patria in January. Former England international striker Luther Blissett, an ambassador for anti-racism charity Show Racism The Red Card, admitted to reservations about the new measures. \"You've got to applaud them for doing something about it, my thing is when they talk about the 'level' of racism,\" he told Radio 5 live. \"To me, racism is racism. \"Fifa have to let it be known where they are going to start this from.

Danny Cipriani kicked Sale's only points but two Camille Lopez penalties gave the hosts a 13-3 interval lead. Napolioni Nalaga plundered two tries to see Clermont pull away and home legend Aurelien Rougerie scored from halfway to secure the four-try bonus point. With three of last year's semi-finalists alongside the Sharks in Pool One the Salford-based side were always going to be big outsiders to qualify, and with a solitary point from two games the knock-out stages look impossible now. They enjoyed some good moments, with David Seymour a constant menace at the breakdown, but ultimately the hosts had too much power and class. Fly-half Cipriani, playing his first game since being left out of the England squad, mixed lovely touches with a couple of careless mistakes, but along with the rest of his side he was powerless to prevent the Clermont onslaught after the break. Despite trailing by 10 points at the interval Sale were competitive in the first half and it took a poor throw at the line-out - far from the last unfortunately for the visitors - to spark Clermont into life. Wales centre Jonathan Davies - who immediately went off with a reported shoulder injury - chipped and regathered before feeding Abendanon, who scooted down the line and produced a piston-like hand-off on Sale scrum-half Will Cliff to score. Lopez, 25, converted and added two penalties after Cipriani's solitary reply for Sale as the hosts edged clear. After the break Clermont grew more dominant by the minute and added a second try when the giant Nalaga claimed Lopez's cross-kick and stepped inside two covering defenders to score. The Fijian powerhouse added a second with 10 minutes remaining after a flowing passing move and, with the passionate home fans demanding a fourth try, the 34-year-old Rougerie dummied on halfway, handed off Tom Arscott and outpaced the Sale defence to score in the corner.

Suspect Jaber al-Bakr gave elite commandos the slip over the weekend, sparking a two-day manhunt. Police believe Mr Bakr was planning to bomb a Berlin airport. The country's best-selling daily newspaper Bild dubbed the refugee trio the \"Syrian heroes of Leipzig\". Politicians from across the spectrum recommended them for the Federal Cross of Merit, a rank in Germany's civilian honours system. Ansgar Heveling, chairman of the parliamentary committee on interior affairs, went a step further and called on them to be granted asylum. Fellow Syrian refugees have also taken to social media to praise their compatriots. Police had been watching Mr Bakr, 22, for months, but he evaded police surveillance on Saturday in the eastern German city of Chemnitz, just as the authorities were preparing to storm an apartment where he was staying. Mr Bakr, who is also Syrian, made his way south to Leipzig and asked for help and shelter from the trio, who later recognised Mr Bakr as a suspect after seeing police's appeals for information in Arabic on Facebook. They quickly overpowered the fugitive, tied him up, and called police. \"I was furious with him, I couldn't accept something like this - especially here in Germany, the country that opened its doors to us,\" one of the men told RTL Television.

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. With all the results now declared, Jac Larner of Cardiff University sums up the night for Wales' five main parties. WELSH LABOUR. Labour have exceeded all expectations in Wales. They have outperformed every single Wales-only poll over the course of the campaign - and the exit poll - achieving their highest share of the vote in Wales since 1997. Not only did they successfully defend their 25 seats, but they gained three seats from the Conservatives, taking their total to 28 in Wales. This is their best performance in terms of seat share since 2005, and their best performance in terms of share of the Wales vote since the New Labour landslide of 1997. This extends their run of winning general elections in Wales to 26 in a row. WELSH CONSERVATIVES. The Conservatives also saw their vote share increase across Wales by 6.3%, but this was not enough for them to hold off Labour's surge in Wales. Early in the night they were confident about gaining seats in Bridgend, Newport West and in the north east of Wales, so a net loss of 3 seats will be a big disappointment. Historically, the Conservatives have always performed worse in Wales than in England at every election going back to 1859, and this election looks to be no different. PLAID CYMRU. It was a strange night for Plaid Cymru that ended in success with the election of their youngest ever MP, Ben Lake. They increased their parliamentary representation, taking Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats, and their vote held up where they were defending the three seats won in 2015. Their group of four MPs is the party's largest Westminster cohort since the 2001 general election. Yet their vote share fell nationally by 1.7% and they lost votes in their other target seats of Ynys Mon, Llanelli and Rhondda. However, Plaid will view themselves as one of the few winners in this election on a night where smaller parties saw their vote share squeezed across the UK. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. The Liberal Democrats' torrid time at elections in Wales continues. They won their worst ever share of the vote in the party's history in Wales, and lost their solo MP Mark Williams in Ceredigion to Plaid Cymru. With only one AM in Wales, and limited representation in local government in Wales, the Liberal Democrats can no longer be considered to be a significant political player in the country. It is the first time since the founding of one of the Lib Dem's predecessor party, the Liberals, in 1859 that they will have no Westminster representation in Wales. UKIP. UKIP's vote share has collapsed considerably across Wales, polling 11.6% less than 2015 after 38 constituencies had been called. Opinion polling across the campaign suggested that around two-thirds of the 2015 UKIP vote would go to the Conservatives. From the results we have seen so far, it seems that a significant proportion of these voters have voted for Labour in Wales.",

    "document": "It is a talent that helped him move from being bankrupt, aged 32, to becoming a multimillionaire by the time he was 48. Along the way he created and sold best-selling upmarket crisps brand Tyrrells, and won a high-profile battle against supermarket giant Tesco. Now 56, and the founder and owner of Chase Vodka, a luxury version of the spirit made from potatoes grown on his farm, the serial entrepreneur says: \"People love stories, the real stories behind things. \"And the media was very important to me from the first days of Tyrrells. \"I was a guy who had been beaten up by the supermarkets, and people love to support the underdog.\" The son of potato farmers who lived near the Herefordshire town of Leominster, Mr Chase bought the family farm from his dad when he was 20 after he \"managed to find a bank manager brave enough to lend me £200,000\". As the cost of potatoes can rise and fall sharply, business was up and down for the next 12 years, until torrential rain in 1992 meant he couldn't harvest his crop, which he had to leave to rot in the fields. Overextended financially, the business collapsed, and Mr Chase had to file for bankruptcy. He says: \"I was very ashamed and embarrassed.\" After \"running away to Australia\" for a few months, he returned to Herefordshire, and was able to borrow funds to buy back the farm from the receivers, and start up in business again. This time, to make extra money, he became a potato trader, buying spuds from a number of farms, and then selling them on to supermarkets. Yet while he got himself back on his feet financially, Mr Chase says he became increasingly frustrated that supermarkets would reject potatoes that weren't \"cosmetically perfect\". He adds: \"I'd send off 10 loads of spuds every day, and I'd be getting five back. It was very painful how the supermarkets were treating us farmers.\" Mr Chase's life-changing moment came in 2002 when he found out that rejected potatoes were being bought up by the UK operation of US crisp-maker Kettle. At the time Kettle was one of new companies making so-called \"posh crisps\", potato crisps which were cut a little thicker than the mass-market brands, and fried by hand. Despite having no crisp-making experience or knowledge, Mr Chase was convinced he could set up his own upmarket crisps brand. So he phoned a few UK crisp-makers to ask if he could see how they did things, and all said \"no\". Undeterred, he flew out to the US and visited facilities in Pennsylvania and Colorado. Returning to the UK, he built a crisp-making facility at the family farm, and Tyrrells [taking its name from the property] was up and running six months later. Quick to tell his story to local newspapers to build up publicity, Mr Chase hit the road to spend two weeks visiting independent food shops across the UK with samples of his crisps. He says: \"Tyrrells grew and grew very quickly, and it was a brilliant cash cow. We'd sell the bags to shops for £1 and they would retail them for £2. For us the net profit was 35%.\" Supermarkets such as Waitrose soon followed suit, but Mr Chase was adamant that he would not sell to the largest - Tesco - because he didn't like what he saw as the pressure it put on farmers to lower their prices. Then one day in 2006 a friend told him that Tesco was selling Tyrrells' crisps. It transpired that Tesco had been buying them on the grey market, and selling them below the recommended retail price. An incensed Mr Chase demanded that Tesco stop selling them. After the supermarket refused, Mr Chase started a media campaign that included an appearance on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Tesco then did back down. With sales of Tyrrells crisps continuing to grow over the next few years, and annual turnover hitting £14m, Mr Chase borrowed money from his bank to expand production. The condition the bank set was that he had to bring in a management team to help him run the business. Mr Chase, who had previously been very hands on, and liked to help out with all parts of the business, says that bringing in new managers ultimately changed the business - to its detriment. \"We got to a stage where I didn't like where the business was going,\" he says. \"We were employing corporate people who were arranging meetings about more meetings.\" Unhappy with Tyrrells' new big business ethos, and going through a \"messy divorce\", Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder - decided to sell up in 2008 to a private capital business for almost £40m. Looking for a new business venture, and with the new owners of Tyrrells choosing to buy their potatoes from elsewhere, Mr Chase came up with the idea of turning his spuds into premium vodka. So with money no longer a problem, he bought a distillation system, and Chase Vodka was born. Aimed at the luxury end of the market, it retails for £35 a bottle. While Mr Chase admits it isn't anywhere near as profitable as selling crisps, it appears to be very much a labour of love. And focused very much on exports, he spends a lot of time travelling the world to build up sales. And showing that he has lost little of his public relations skills, every year he flies influential barmen and women from around the world to visit his farm in Herefordshire to see how the potatoes are grown, and vodka is made. Also now making a gin and a whisky, the Chase Distillery sells 10,000 bottles a week. Mr Chase says: \"You have to tell people your story if you want to build your brand. But there has to be real DNA behind it if you want to be successful.\"",

    "document": "In a series of Twitter posts addressed directly to Mr Maduro, Mr Almagro also called him a \"petty dictator\". Mr Maduro accused the OAS chief earlier this week of being a CIA agent and a traitor himself. The Venezuelan president has blamed his country's economic crisis on an axis of enemy forces co-ordinated from the US. During a three-hour long news conference on Tuesday, Mr Maduro had justified his declaration of a state of emergency by saying Venezuela was under attack from imperialist forces led by the CIA. He then told journalists: \"Almagro, just give up. He has been a traitor for a long time... At some point I will tell his story, I know his secrets. The Americans, the CIA, have played a master move using Almagro as their agent.\" Mr Almagro, who before leading the OAS was the foreign minister of his native Uruguay, had already clashed with Mr Maduro last year after he called him \"rubbish\". Mr Almagro had responded on that occasion with an eight-page open letter, saying he would be \"rubbish\" if he ignored the plight of the Venezuelan people. His Twitter posts this week were both more concise and more direct. Linking to his open letter to Mr Maduro, Mr Almagro said: @NicolasMaduro I'm not a traitor either to my ideas or my principles BUT YOU ARE A TRAITOR to your people. In a series of 12 tweets, he also told the Venezuelan president that \"you will NEVER be able to undo so much suffering, intimidation, misery and anguish you've created for your people\". He also said Mr Maduro would \"NEVER be able to bring back to life the children who've died because of lack of medicine\". Venezuelan doctors say a shortage of essential medicine has reached a crisis point. Mr Almagro also urged Mr Maduro to allow a recall referendum to go ahead. Opposition politicians have handed in a petition with 1.85 million signatures to the electoral authorities requesting a referendum be held to recall Mr Maduro from office. But Mr Maduro's deputy, Vice-President Aristobulo Isturiz, on Sunday ruled out such a referendum, saying the signatures were \"fraudulent\". Mr Almagro said that not letting the referendum go ahead made Mr Maduro \"another petty dictator\". While President Maduro did not answer Mr Almagro's tweets directly, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez did. She wrote, \"Mr Almagro, every time you make a statement you express your hatred against Venezuela and its legitimate authorities. You are part of the imperialist detritus.\" \"You only repeat the scripted words which your imperialist masters dictate to you\". \"You will never give orders to Venezuela!\" The former president of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, has also commented on the row between Mr Almagro, who served as Mr Mujica's foreign minister, and President Maduro. Asked what he made of the bitter exchange, he said using a popular Spanish saying that Mr Maduro was \"crazy as a goat\". \"They're all crazy in Venezuela, they call each other all sorts of things but they're not going to fix anything this way.\" While Mr Mujica is known for his direct and outspoken manner his words are damaging to Mr Maduro, who has always praised the former left-wing president as a \"comrade\".",

    "document": "New analysis for BBC News shows that many people relying on their savings income are worse off than ever before. Savings rates plummeted after the Bank of England slashed its base rate in the financial crisis. Since last autumn, as the economic outlook has worsened, they have fallen again. Tax-free Isas, fixed rate bonds and easy access accounts are all at or near their lowest points. In research carried out for the BBC, the rate-checking firm Savings Champion recorded 1,440 savings rate cuts last year and more than 230 so far this year. While low interest rates are welcomed by mortgage borrowers, they strike fear into those at or near retirement who had hoped that income from their nest eggs would help pay the bills. \"There's no light at the end of the tunnel,\" says 76-year-old Mick Bridge, one of a group of ramblers from Chesterfield who all depend on savings. \"Like most retired people, there was a plan and suddenly it's not like it was anymore. The pot's disappearing.\" Fellow walker Sharon Beresford is worried that low interest rates will leave more older people needing help to pay for care. \"It's helping young people buy houses, but it's not helping me,\" she says, \"There are a lot of us to be looked after.\" The fall in rates has come across the board, with significant reductions from National Savings & Investments, Bank of Scotland, NatWest and Nationwide Building Society. The average return from the five best easy access accounts has dropped from more than 3% in 2012 to under 1.3%. Tax-free Isa rates are at their lowest ever. The average variable rate Isa is down to 1%, while a typical fixed-rate Isa pays 1.4%. Another Chesterfield rambler, 63-year-old Judith Knowles, started dipping into her savings when she discovered she would have to wait for her state pension because women's pension ages were being raised. Low savings rates have forced her to dip in again. \"It's worrying,\" she says. \"I've had letters saying the rates are going down even more.\" Some rates of return are so tiny that savers can improve their situation by switching to a better offer. First Direct pays just 0.05% to customers in its Savings Account, while Santander has an Easy Isa with an interest rate of a mere 0.1%. Anna Bowes, director of Savings Champion, traces the problem back to a decision by the previous Coalition government to supply banks with cheap money to boost their lending. \"The competition between providers has been sucked out of the market,\" she explains, \"They just don't need to raise money from savers any more, which has had a devastating impact.\" A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: \"These have been frustrating times for savers. The Bank of England's base rate has remained at a record low for several years. \"While this has been good news for borrowers, it has fostered a low-interest-rate environment which has not been easy for many savers to bear.\" The looming EU referendum has confused the outlook for savers, with George Osborne warning borrowers that a vote to leave could lead to higher interest rates and others speculating that uncertainty could prompt the Bank of England to cut its base rate again. Behind the scenes, senior bankers warn that very low savings rates are likely to be the \"new normal\", given the precarious economic situation across the world.",

Sightseers have been warned to stay away from the scene of the grounding, and a 300m temporary exclusion zone has been put in place around Dalmore beach. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it was necessary to keep roads clear. The rig, which is carrying 280 tonnes of diesel oil, broke free from its tug during towing and severe weather prevented the line being reconnected. A salvage team began an inspection of the structure on Tuesday in preparation for the more detailed assessment. Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention, said the initial survey was to check \"a number of things including fuel tanks\". Officials said the aim was to carry-out as much work as possible on Wednesday while the weather was favourable, but warned that work to refloat the rig could take some time.

The survey indicates that only 11% of of the chamber's members in Northern Ireland support a British exit (Brexit). That compares to 30% of those surveyed in the rest of the UK. The Chamber of Commerce has about 1,200 members in Northern Ireland. About 250 of those responded to the poll. More than half of the respondents (60%) said that Prime Minister David Cameron's renegotiated EU deal is unlikely to change how they will vote. The results come on the eve of crunch Brussels talks, which are expected to result in a deal. Eighty-four per cent of those surveyed in Northern Ireland  also say that there has been no impact on their sales and orders as of yet, due to the uncertainty of Britain's future within the EU. Commenting on the results, President of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce Stephen McCully said the findings suggest that \"the renegotiation is having little impact on day-to-day business - or the vote of the business community\".

Recent polls suggest support for Mr Macron, tipped by many to win the election, has dropped slightly. Two of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen's staff were detained on Wednesday as part of a financial inquiry. Her chief of staff was placed under formal investigation over the alleged misuse of EU funds to pay parliamentary assistants, French media report. Her bodyguard was also questioned. The National Front (FN) leader, who denies any wrongdoing, dismissed the investigation as a \"political dirty trick\". She enjoys a solid lead in opinion polls for the first round in April but is seen as being easily defeated in the second. Mr Bayrou has run three times for president, winning more than 18% of the vote in the 2007 election. Announcing that he would not stand this year, he offered to join forces with Mr Macron to prevent \"the failure of France\". Ms Le Pen, he said, posed a \"major and immediate threat for our country and Europe\". Welcoming the news, Mr Macron, a free-market liberal, told Reuters news agency: \"The alliance proposed by Francois Bayrou... fully matches our commitment to renewal and unity.\" Analysts say Mr Bayrou's support base is likely to split now between Mr Macron and his conservative opponent Francois Fillon. A new opinion poll indicates that Mr Macron and Mr Fillon are neck and neck in the race for the all-important second place in the first round - with both on about 19%. According to the same poll, taken before the alliance was announced, Mr Bayrou would net 5.5% while Ms Le Pen would take 26%. In the second round, Mr Macron would beat Ms Le Pen by 61% to 39%, while Mr Fillon would also defeat the far-right candidate, but by 57% to 43%. Early on in the campaign, Mr Fillon was viewed as the clear favourite to reach the run-off along with Ms Le Pen and win, but a scandal over payments to his family dented his image in January. He had talks with his fellow conservative former prime minister Alain Juppe, whom he beat in the Republican party primaries, on Wednesday, Le Figaro newspaper reports. Ms Le Pen has been accused by the European Parliament of misusing a total of some 340,000 euros (£289,000; $359,000), AFP news agency reports. It is alleged that she claimed a salary for her bodyguard Thierry Legier for a bogus job and paid her chief of staff, Catherine Griset, as her EU assistant in Brussels when Ms Griset was actually working for the party. Mr Legier and Ms Griset were taken in for questioning on Wednesday. \"The French can tell the difference between genuine scandals and political dirty tricks,\" Ms Le Pen responded, drawing a distinction between her case and that of Mr Fillon.

    "document": "Youngsters are returning to school this week in Scotland, with parents in other areas of the UK preparing children for the next academic year. They are able to buy school shirts for £1 and sweaters for £2. But rising cotton and wool prices mean it is unlikely that uniform prices can fall any further, Neil Saunders, of Verdict Research, said. The big four UK supermarket chains - Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - as well as Marks and Spencer, are selling the constituent parts of a generic school uniform for less than £5 each. For example, Asda is selling a white shirt for £1, Sainsbury's has put a £2 price tag on grey and black trousers, and Tesco has blue and green sweaters on sale for £1.75. Although labour costs are low as many of these items are manufactured in Bangladesh and China, the margin for these items is still extremely slim. The supermarkets accept this owing to the brand loyalty they gain from customers, who buy uniforms at cheap prices and then stay in the store to buy other goods such as school accessories and groceries. The price war is unusual and prices for many other items are rising. Plus-size school uniforms launch. The picture is also different for parents who must buy uniforms from specialist suppliers. Owing to prescriptive demands of these uniforms, prices tend to be higher than the generic supermarket clothes. Verdict Research estimates the UK school uniform market to be worth £694m. The average price of a standard uniform has fallen by almost 21% since 2004, it said, with supermarkets increasing their market share. However, the total value of uniform and equipment sales has fallen from £861m in 2004 to £694m, the research group said. Neil Saunders, of Verdict, said that the quality of uniforms tended not to be at the same level as a decade ago. \"As long as they last, parents are not too concerned,\" he said. \"Children run around in these things, rip holes in them, and they fall apart anyway. As long as it lasts a term or half a year, parents are quite satisfied with that.\" He added that because wholesale prices of cotton and wool were rising, it would be difficult to cut prices any further. Last month, Marks and Spencer announced it had started to sell over-sized school uniforms for overweight children as young as four. Campaigners said it was simply commercial recognition of the fact obesity was a growing problem among younger pupils. Marks and Spencer said the trial range followed demand from parents.",

    "document": "It was relief more than real jubilation. The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about expectations. At one point a rumour swept the gathering that he'd lost more than a third of his alliance's seats in the Knesset - in the end the exit polls suggested it would be more like a quarter. Cue wild celebration. If you add together Mr Netanyahu's natural allies among the religious parties and the rest of the right - and assume he'll be able to attract at least one party from the centre or even the left - then he should be able to form a government again. Senior Likud figure Danny Danon was quick to tell me that the only thing that would be remembered from this night was the fact that his boss had won a third term as prime minister. \"There is only one prime minister possible for Israel from these results. And that's Benjamin Netanyahu. \"I say to my friends here on the left that they should not be opening the champagne after these results.\" Any champagne that Mr Netanyahu may be tempted to open will be feeling a little flat though. He emerges from these elections a rather diminished figure, whose wheeling and dealing skills may be sorely tested as he sets about building a new coalition. When he spoke to a crowd of activists in Tel Aviv he was measured, although it took him some time to persuade his supporters to stop celebrating long enough to make himself heard. \"I am going to seek as broad a government as possible\", he said. \" I'm going to seek out many partners.\" That was perhaps his way of acknowledging that the overall results of the night were curiously ambiguous. To the left of Mr Netanyahu, Labour picked up seats but to the right of him so did Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home party) led by his former chief of staff Naftali Bennett. The undoubted star of the evening was Yair Lapid, a famous TV presenter who stepped off the screen to found a new centrist party called Yesh Atid (There is a Future). It has been an extraordinary debut. The party may well emerge as the second largest grouping in the new Knesset and should command a place in a Netanyahu-led coalition. Because Mr Lapid is a political newcomer, it's hard to say what price he might try to extract in return for his support. But you can expect a higher profile for the vexed issue of whether Israel's ultra-Orthodox community ought to be required to perform its share of national service (it's currently exempt). The wider world will examine these results for clues about Israel's future attitude towards peace talks with the Palestinians or the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. The truth of the matter is that it's far too early to make those kind of judgements, which will depend on the balance of forces within a future coalition more than on the outcome of the popular vote. But the sudden and decisive lurch to the right that many predicted hasn't happened. The results show that there's plenty of life on the left and the centre of Israeli politics too. Some political journalists at Likud headquarters were arguing within hours of the exit polls that the results sent such a confused signal about the political mood in Israel that they made another election likely within a year. We'll see. Having said this is a chastening result for Benjamin Netanyahu it's only fair to record that it's been a thought provoking one for anyone in the business of making political predictions here, too. Mr Netanyahu was supposed to win easily - and he certainly didn't. And the campaign was supposed to have failed to capture the Israeli imagination - and turnout was remarkably high. It's said to take an average of well over a month to form a coalition government after polling day here - and there's no reason to assume that it will be any quicker than the average this time around. The first contacts between party leaders were probably under way before the celebrations at Likud HQ had died away. Israel and the wider Middle East must now wait to see what sort of government will eventually emerge.",

The 29-year-old filmed himself raping two patients at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where he worked. He also attacked women who had passed out while he was on duty at a music festival, Oxford Crown Court heard. Hutchinson targeted women who had lost consciousness through drinking too much and they were unaware they had been assaulted until contacted by Thames Valley Police. The court heard the women he raped in the A&E department at the Oxford hospital had to view parts of Hutchinson's recordings in order to identify themselves. One victim, an 18-year-old, was raped in October 2011 and a 35-year-old was raped in February 2012. He also attacked two women in their 20s while volunteering as a medic at the Wilderness Festival in Cornbury Park, Oxfordshire, in August 2013. His was tending the women when he committed the crimes, one in a medical tent and the other in a nearby ambulance. Officers initially arrested him for secretly filming girls as young as nine in changing rooms at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon in November 2013. Following a search of his home, police found footage of sex attacks on his computer and mobile phone. The court was told Hutchinson also had hundreds of other voyeuristic images, including \"up skirt\" pictures taken on the London Underground while he was  volunteering at the 2012 Olympics. Victims were also filmed at John Radcliffe Hospital and at a gym in Batley, West Yorkshire where he had previously worked. At a hearing on 30 March, he also pleaded guilty to outraging public decency, making indecent images of children, theft of a hospital camera used for internal examinations and possession of the class B drug ketamine. The victims of his crimes were aged between nine and 35, although many were unidentifiable due to the nature of the footage. Catherine Stoddart, chief nurse at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: \"I am shocked and horrified by the way in which Andrew Hutchinson has betrayed the patients he was entrusted to care for and his colleagues, who also trusted him.\" She said the hospital will be carrying out an internal review to see if Hutchinson could have been prevented from committing his crimes. Hutchinson was suspended by the trust in November 2013 following allegations he stole medical equipment. It also informed the Nursing and Midwifery Council and launched an internal investigation, which led to his dismissal. Judge Ian Pringle QC described Hutchinson's crimes as \"despicable\". He said: \"When they were unconscious requiring your help and your assistance as their nurse, you raped them and you filmed it. \"It is impossible to conceive of a greater breach of trust in our society.\" In a statement read out in court, one of the victims said: \"I think that what he has done is much worse that doing it in the street because I had no idea what was happening, so I had no opportunity to fight back.\" Senior investigating officer, Det Ch Insp Mark Johns of Thames Valley Police, said: \"This has been a particularly complicated, unusual and sensitive case as the victims were not aware that offences took place because they were not conscious. \"I would like to thank the victims for the great courage and dignity they have shown during our investigation.\" Police said all victims who can be identified have been contacted.

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year. But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report \"disingenuous\". He said it was \"another example of fudging the facts\". The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union. The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers their impact on overall migration figures. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw. No-one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration. It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place. But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration? Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force? Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere? And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK? These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum. The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: \"It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes.\" Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would \"continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future\", he said. \"Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries,\" he said. \"Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services.\" The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20% of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work. It said: \"This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000.\" The figures should not be taken as a \"precise estimate\" but were \"intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined\", it said. There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded. Those who are \"self-sufficient\" would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs. Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK. Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested. However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: \"Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. We have an opt-out from the passport-free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market. \"The Leave campaigns haven't produced a shred of evidence to show how they could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if we left.\" The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers they may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe. Most recent estimated net migration to the UK reached a record 336,000 in the year to June 2015 according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures.",

It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had \"ironclad information\" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and \"pushed hard\" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was \"just not true\", but he hoped the resolution would \"serve as a wake-up call\" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\". Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. \"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said. \"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution \"paves the way\" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January. \"We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,\" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.",

    "document": "His arrest over the death of model Reeva Steenkamp has stunned the country where he is considered a national hero. The 26-year-old is due to appear in court on Friday. Mr Pistorius made history in London last year when he became the first double-amputee track athlete to compete in the Olympic Games. By Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Johannesburg. There is widespread shock and disbelief in South Africa after athlete Oscar Pistorius was arrested over the killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. There has been an outpouring of grief for the model, along with many messages of support for the six-time Paralympic champion, who has earned huge public admiration for his long battle to be allowed to compete in the Olympics. The common thread for many is disbelief - at the implication this has for the athlete's future but also at the tragic end of the celebrity couple's love story. The pair apparently started dating in November, frequently posted loving messages about each other on social network Twitter and were seen at high-profile events arm in arm. Their relationship seemed perfect. He is known as the \"blade runner\" because of the carbon fibre prosthetic blades he races in. He was born without a fibula in both legs and had his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday. Police were called to his home in the upmarket Silver Woods gated compound on the outskirts of South Africa's administrative capital in the early hours of Thursday morning. They found paramedics treating a 29-year-old woman with four gunshot wounds to the head and upper body. She died at the scene, and officers recovered a 9mm pistol. Early reports suggested Mr Pistorius might have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder. Police say neighbours heard screaming and shouting around the time of the shooting, and that they had been called to investigate incidents of a domestic nature at the same house in the past. They also said that they would oppose any bail application. Hours later, after being questioned by police, Mr Pistorius left a police station accompanied by officers, his face mostly covered by the hood of a grey jacket. His court hearing was originally scheduled for Thursday afternoon but had been postponed until Friday to give forensic investigators time to carry out their work, said Medupe Simasiku, a spokesman for the prosecution. Mr Pistorius's father, Henke, declined to comment but said: \"We all pray for guidance and strength for Oscar and the lady's parents.'' Miss Steenkamp's publicist confirmed to the BBC that the 29-year-old model had died. \"Everyone who knew her is in tears. She was an absolute angel, the sweetest, sweetest human being, a kind human being,\" Sarit Tomlinson said. In her last Twitter messages, Miss Steenkamp had spoken about her excitement about Valentine's Day. \"What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow?'' she tweeted. \"It should be a day of love for everyone.'' Mr Pistorius dominated in his category at successive Paralympic Games, but in 2008 he won a legal battle over his blades - which critics said gave him an unfair advantage - with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF)  for the right to compete in able-bodied competitions. Oscar Pistorius profile. Reaction: Pistorius shooting. He reached the 400m semi-finals in the London 2012 Olympics. At the Paralympics he won silver in the T44 200m, gold in the 4x100 relay and gold in the T44 400m, setting a Paralympic record. He was named by Time Magazine last year as one of the world's 100 most influential people. In interviews, he had spoken about his enjoyment of target shooting with his pistol, and an online advertisement featuring him for Nike read: \"I am a bullet in the chamber.\" Mr Pistorius's former coach, Andrea Giannini, spoke out in favour of the athlete following his arrest. \"No matter how bad the situation was, Oscar always stayed calm and positive,'' he told the Associated Press news agency. \"Whenever he was tired or nervous he was still extremely nice to people. I never saw him violent.'' South Africa has one of the highest rates of crime in the world and many residents keep weapons to protect themselves against intruders.

    "document": "The SFA's performance director has been conducting a review since taking over from Mark Wotte. Across the seven schools involved throughout Scotland, 374 children receive up to 10 hours a week specialised coaching as part of their everyday studies. \"There's been a lot of time invested in this project by a lot of people and we're looking at how we continue to improve the programme as we travel through the years,\" McClair told BBC Scotland. The project is now in its fourth year, with this year's intake of pupils the final one of the initial scheme. McClair will decide in the coming months whether it will continue in its current format once an analysis of how it is working has been concluded. Alternatives could include certificating the programme to award pupils a Higher qualification for completing the course or focusing on a smaller group of children at one single, residential campus rather than the seven schools involved just now. At the very least, the current system will continue until this year's S1 pupils have completed fourth year. Gauging its success thus far is tricky, with the oldest participants still only in S4, but McClair believes there are some good indicators. \"I think you can be encouraged by the number of young people who have been in the performance schools who have been in the younger representative squads over the last three-and-a-bit years and the evidence suggests that will continue,\" he added. \"By summertime I think it'll be a half-decent measure of the number of young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full-time football, although I believe that's changing a little bit in the sense that it's 16 or 17 that some clubs are looking at taking them in full-time. \"The idea's great. Many clubs in England have taken it on board - getting kids in during the day, giving them more opportunities to practise the disciplines involved in football. \"The evidence is all there that they're improving quicker than they were previously under a hybrid programme where all the coaching was taking place in the evening or at weekends.\" The other important gauge of success is academic achievement. Exam results will not be available from the SFA project until this summer, but Graeme High School in Falkirk ran a pilot scheme - of which Craig Sibbald and Celtic youngster Paul McMullan are graduates - that allows for some analysis. \"Last year we had a group of 14 or 15 and the vast majority were highly successful, able pupils, one with five Highers, two with four Highers, three with three Highers and a suite of other academic achievements,\" headteacher Lesley Carroll told BBC Scotland. \"Most of them have gone on to professional clubs but they have got a fallback position. They have been some of our top-performing academic pupils too because not only do they have to be elite athlete footballers, they have to have what the SFA would call a growth mindset. \"They're not afraid of targets, hard work, commitment, drive and confidence.\" Indeed, Carroll believes there is an argument the programme helps the performance school students achieve better results in their other subjects, though she admits no \"real forensic research has been done into that\". But it will be the level of footballing development that determines exactly how McClair and the SFA proceed in terms of their future performance strategy.",

The company had been charged with managing subscriptions and fan records for Duran Duran, with 75% of profits going to the musicians. Its owners declined to comment when contacted by the Associated Press. According to their legal action, filed in Cook County Circuit Court, Duran Duran also contend that the company - which operates out of the town of Glenview - failed to keep accurate accounts of fan club activity since they gained the contract for the work in 2010. It also stated they have made repeated requests for the unpaid fees to be settled. Part of their brief was to process subscriptions from fans, while their headquarters would also serve as a warehouse for the distribution of band merchandise. They were entitled to keep 25% of proceeds for their activities. Duran Duran were formed in Birmingham in 1978, with its core members Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes and John Taylor still in the line-up today. They have enjoyed a string of hits in both the UK and US, including Hungry Like The Wolf and Rio. In 2012, they performed at a concert to mark the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in Hyde Park. The band are currently at work on their 14th studio album.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Her 15-year battle for justice finally bore fruit last week, when the Bombay high court confirmed the life sentences of 11 men found guilty of rape and murder. The court also convicted five policemen and two doctors, who were earlier cleared by the trial court, of destroying evidence. The landmark ruling, Bilkis Bano told the BBC in Delhi on Sunday, had finally given her hope of peace. \"I always had full faith in the judiciary and I'm grateful to the Bombay high court for the order. It's a very good judgement and I'm very happy with it,\" she told me. \"I think the state government and the police were all complicit in the crime, because the accused were given full freedom to rape and pillage,\" she said. \"I feel vindicated that the court has convicted the police and the doctors too. I feel I've received justice.\" Bilkis Bano's fight for justice has been long and nightmarish but, she says, giving up was never an option. It has been well documented that some police and state officials tried to intimidate her, evidence was destroyed and the dead were buried without post-mortems. The doctors who examined her said she hadn't been raped, and she received death threats. Despite the gravity of the crime and the fact she identified her attackers, the first arrests in the case were only made in 2004 after India's Supreme Court handed over the case to federal investigators, the Central Bureau of Investigation. The Supreme Court also accepted her plea that the courts in Gujarat could not deliver her justice and transferred her case to a court in Mumbai. The battle has been hugely disruptive for her family. In the past 15 years, she and her husband Yakub Rasool have moved home 10 times, moving in and out of Gujarat with their five children. \"We still can't go home because we're afraid. Police and the state administration have always helped our attackers. When we are in Gujarat, we still cover our faces, we never give out our address,\" Mr Rasool said. The attack on Bilkis Bano and her family was one of the most horrific crimes during the riots, which began when a fire on a passenger train in Godhra town killed 60 Hindu pilgrims. Blaming Muslims for starting the fire, Hindu mobs went on a rampage, attacking Muslim neighbourhoods and destroying their property. For three days the rioters had free rein, as the state administration and the police looked the other way. More than 1,000 people died, most of them Muslims. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was then Gujarat chief minister, was criticised for not doing enough to prevent the carnage. He has always denied any wrongdoing and has not apologised for the riots. A Supreme Court panel also refused to prosecute him in 2013, citing insufficient evidence. But he's never been able to shake off the criticism completely, with many holding him responsible for the killings on his watch. Over the years, the courts have convicted dozens of people for their involvement in the riots. In 2012 an ex-minister and aide to Mr Modi was jailed for 28 years. But many other people are still waiting for justice. Fifteen years later, Bilkis Bano still fights back tears as she recounts the horror of those days. She was visiting her parents, who lived in a village called Randhikpur, not far from Godhra. She was 19 and the mother of a three-year-old daughter, and she was pregnant with her second child. \"It was the morning after the train fire. I was in the kitchen, making lunch, when my aunt and her children came running. They said their homes were being set on fire and we had to leave immediately,\" she said. \"We left with just the clothes we were wearing, we didn't even have the time to put on our slippers.\" Within minutes, all the Muslim homes in the neighbourhood had emptied. The 50-odd families that lived there had gone, looking for safety. Bilkis Bano was in a group of 17 people that included her three-year-old daughter, her mother, a pregnant cousin, her younger siblings, nieces and nephews, and two adult men. \"We first went to the village council head, a Hindu, seeking his protection. But when the mobs began threatening to kill him too if he gave shelter to Muslims, we were forced to leave.\" For the next few days, the group travelled from village to village, seeking shelter in a mosque, or subsisting on the kindness of Hindu neighbours. But then their time ran out. On the morning of 3 March, as they set out to go to a nearby village where they believed they would be safer, a group of men travelling in two jeeps stopped them. \"They attacked us with swords and sticks. One of them snatched my daughter from my lap and threw her on the ground, bashing her head into a rock.\" Bilkis Bano had cuts on her hands and legs. Her attackers were her neighbours in the village, 12 men she had seen almost daily while growing up. They tore off her clothes and several of them raped her. She begged them for mercy and told them she was five months' pregnant, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. Her cousin, who had delivered a baby girl two days earlier while they were on the run, was raped and murdered. Her newborn was killed too. Bilkis Bano survived because she lost consciousness and her attackers left, believing she was dead. Two boys - seven and four - were the only other survivors of the massacre. When she came to, she covered her body with a blood-soaked petticoat, climbed a nearby hill and hid in a cave for a day. \"The next day I was very thirsty so I came down to a nearby tribal village to find some water. The villagers were initially suspicious of me and came out with sticks, but then they helped me. They gave me a blouse and a scarf to cover my body.\" She spotted a police jeep and they took her to the police station, where she narrated her ordeal. \"I'm illiterate so I asked the policemen to read out the complaint once they had written it down, but they refused to do that. They just took my thumb impression and wrote whatever they wanted. I knew all my attackers and I'd named them. But the police did not write down any names,\" she said. The next day, she was sent to a camp in Godhra set up for those displaced by the riots. That's where her husband was reunited with her 15 days later and where they lived for the next few months. Her unborn child survived the rape and she later gave birth to a daughter. The past 15 years have been \"very difficult\", but the couple say the high court order has brought them some closure. In the past few days, comparisons have been drawn between Bilkis Bano's case and that of the 2012 gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a bus in the Indian capital, Delhi. A day after the Bilkis Bano judgement, the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentences of the four men accused of the crime. Many have since asked whether Bilkis Bano's case did not merit the death penalty for her attackers. Prosecutors had demanded capital punishment for three of the men. Bilkis Bano, however, says she does not believe in revenge. \"Both the crimes were equally horrible, but I don't believe in taking anyone's life. I don't want the death penalty for them,\" she said. \"I want them to spend their entire lives in jail. I hope they will one day realise the enormity of their crime, how they killed small children and raped women. \"I'm not interested in revenge. I just want them to understand what they've done.\"",

The attack happened early on Sunday near the town of Dogubayezit in Agri province, near the border with Iran. Since 24 July, Turkey has carried out hundreds of air raids on PKK bases on both sides of the Iraq-Turkey border. A Turkish state news agency, Anadolu, said the tractor was carrying two tons of explosives that were detonated by a suicide bomber. Turkey's army said in a statement that \"long-range guns\" were also found. Four of the injured were in a serious condition. The statement said the Karabulak Gendarmerie Station was hit at around 03:00 local time on Sunday (midnight GMT). Images in the Turkish press showed a badly-damaged building with the roof destroyed. One report said the blast was so strong that houses in a village several hundred metres away were hit by debris and some residents were slightly injured. The Dogan news agency added that militants also set up ambushes on roads to prevent medical teams getting to the scene. There has been no comment from the PKK so far. AFP news agency said it would be the first time the group was accused of deploying a suicide bomber during recent clashes. Turkey says the group was behind a number of attacks in the last two weeks:. Turkey's official news agency says about 260 Kurdish fighters have been killed in strikes in northern Iraq and Turkey since 24 July. It has also targeted positions held by the Islamic State group. At least six people were killed and several wounded in further Turkish air strikes on Saturday east of Erbil, said local officials. The pro-PKK Firat news agency described an attack on the village of Zerkel as a \"massacre\". Iraqi Kurdish President Massoud Barzani said: \"We condemn the bombing, which led to the martyrdom of the citizens of the Kurdish region, and we call on Turkey to not repeat the bombing of civilians.\" The Turkish military on Sunday said it had investigated the incident and dismissed claims that there could have been civilian casualties in Zerkel, Reuters reported. Turkey considers both the PKK and IS terrorist organisations. The PKK has been fighting Turkey for an autonomous homeland for the Kurds. More than 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced since the PKK began an armed uprising in 1984. In 2012, the government and PKK began peace talks and the following year a ceasefire was agreed. However, the ceasefire ended in effect when Turkey launched raids against Kurdish separatist camps in northern Iraq last month. The raids came after the PKK reportedly killed two Turkish police officers in retaliation for an attack claimed by Islamic State and what the PKK sees as Turkey's collaboration with IS.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. They are young and clever, and they want to change the world - one bus at a time. \"We've created the world's first bus that runs on formic acid, which is a much cheaper solution than hydrogen, yet it delivers the same environmental benefits,\" says Lucas van Cappellen from Team Fast, a spin-off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. \"We're building our own future.\" Around 40 of his fellow students are endeavouring to develop emissions-free transport that will help in the global battle against climate change. And they're also trying to create careers for themselves. Formic acid is found in nature, delivered in the stings and bites of ants and other insects - the Latin word for ant is formica. And this simple carboxylic acid (chemical formula HCOOH) is already used in textiles and leather processing, as a livestock feed preservative, and is also found in some household limescale removers. But Team Fast has found a way the acid can efficiently carry the ingredients needed for hydrogen fuel cells, used to power electric vehicles. The fuel, which the team has dubbed hydrozine (not to be confused with hydrazine), is a liquid, which means you can transport it easily and refill vehicles quickly, as with conventional fuels. The difference is that it is much cleaner. \"The tailpipe emissions are only CO2 and water,\" explains Mr van Cappellen. \"No other harmful gases like nitric oxides, soot or sulphuric oxides are emitted.\" To prove the concept in the real world, an electric bus is set to hit the road in the Netherlands later this year, where it will shuttle between running on conventional bus routes and appearing at promotional events and industry fairs. The bus has an electric drive system, developed by bus builder VDL, that receives additional power from the formic acid fuel cell system mounted in a range-extender trailer, towed behind. \"Our tank is around 300 litres, so we will extend the range of the bus by 200km (180 miles). However, we could of course make the tank bigger very easily,\" says Mr van Cappellen. Current hydrogen fuel cell buses have a range of up to 400km. But why develop a bus rather than a car? \"If we built a car, we would compete with electric cars, but we believe battery-powered cars are a good solution for a lot of people,\" says Mr van Cappellen. \"But if we prove that we can build a bus that meets the needs of bus companies, with a range of around 400km and quick refuelling, we will have shown the potential of hydrozine in a segment where there is no sustainable competition yet.\" Hydrozine is created through a chemical reaction between water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). More Technology of Business. \"In a reactor, water and CO2 are bonded using sustainable electricity. This is a direct, sustainable electrochemical process,\" explains Mr van Cappellen. The hydrozine is then broken down by a catalyst into hydrogen and carbon dioxide inside a piece of kit called a reformer that Team Fast is attempting to patent. Its newly designed reformer is a tenth of the size of reformers of the past, which is why \"it is now applicable in transport applications for the first time\". The hydrogen is then added to a fuel cell where it reacts with oxygen to generate the electricity that powers the electric motor. \"We are continuously looking for new technologies that can extend the range of zero emissions traffic in a simple way,\" says Menno Kleingeld, managing director, VDL Enabling Transport Solutions. \"The decomposition of formic acid into hydrogen gas is one of these new, promising technologies.\" But does it really stand a chance of becoming commercially viable? \"It costs about 35,000 euros (Â£30,000) to convert a conventional petrol filling station to a hydrozine filling station, a process that essentially involves replacing the pipes and coating the tanks,\" says Mr van Cappellen. As such, it is \"100 times cheaper\" to roll out a fuelling network for hydrozine than for gaseous hydrogen, he maintains. \"Hydrozine is currently cheaper than petrol and more expensive than diesel in the Netherlands, and in future we expect prices to come down so it will be cheaper than both,\" he adds. Although the bus emits CO2, Team Fast argues that the original CO2 used to create the hydrozine is taken from existing sources, such as air or exhaust fumes, so that no additional CO2 is produced - it's a closed carbon cycle in the jargon. Some experts believe the technology shows promise. \"Team Fast has a very good project,\" says Professor Richard van de Sanden, head of the Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research. \"It works on a very important issue: the storing of renewable energy in a transportable form and in a form which can actually be used.\" And several companies are supporting the project. \"What we're working on together is a version of renewable energy that can combine renewable energy with CO2 capture,\" says Martijn de Graaff, senior business development manager at TNO Industry. \"If we achieve this it will give us a stable future.\" The students' own commitment is impressive, with 15 of the 40 working full time on the project, and the rest contributing at least 20-25 hours per week. \"We don't get study points for it, but you can only learn so much at university about the practical experience of things,\" Mr van Cappellen says. \"It's our own future we're making.\"",

    "document": "The New York businessman-turned-politician said many controversial things and flip-flopped on a number of policy positions during the campaign. Here, we look back at 24 of his professed beliefs. 1. The US should use waterboarding. This and other methods of \"strong interrogation\" should be deployed in its fight against the Islamic State group. These methods, Mr Trump said, are \"peanuts\" compared to the tactics used by the militants, such as beheadings. \"I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough,\" he said in June of the banned practice. 2. Mexico should pay for the \"great, great wall\" Mr Trump has said he wants to start building the much-touted wall on the shared border from the first day of his presidency, and that Mexico will pay for it. In some of his earliest campaign comments, he suggested that Mexicans coming to the US were criminals and \"rapists\".  BBC analysis estimates the border wall could cost between $2.2bn and $13bn. 3. Muslims should not be admitted to the US. In the wake of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, Mr Trump wrote that he was \"calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on\". He's since gone back on the announcement, instead saying that that he would temporarily suspend \"immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism\". 4. Arab-Americans cheered the attacks on 9/11. Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that on 11 September 2001, there were thousands of Arab-Americans celebrating in New Jersey after two planes flew into the Twin Towers. He says such public demonstrations \"tell you something\" about Muslims living in the US. However, there are no media reports to back up the claim. 5. Obamacare is a \"disaster\". Mr Trump says he wants Congress to fully repeal the president's Affordable Care Act, which aims at extending the number of Americans with health insurance, but he believes that \"everybody's got to be covered\". A spokesman for Mr Trump said he would propose \"a health plan that will return authority to the states and operate under free market principles\". The increase in premiums revealed just before the election bolstered the Trump attacks. 6. Climate change is just \"weather\" While Mr Trump believes that maintaining \"clean air\" and \"clean water\" is important, he has dismissed climate change science as a \"hoax\" and believes environmental restrictions on businesses make them less competitive in the global marketplace. \"I do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country,\" he told CNN on the issue. \"It costs so much and nobody knows exactly if it's going to work.\" 7. The world would be better off if Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi were still in power. Mr Trump told CNN that he believes the situation in both Libya and Iraq is \"far worse\" than it ever was under the leaders of the two countries. While he concedes Saddam was a \"horrible guy\", he says he did a better job combating terrorists. 8. Illegal migrants should be deported. Trump once said that he wanted to deport all of the approximately 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the US, despite criticism that this idea is both xenophobic, next to impossible and prohibitively expensive - the BBC estimates a cost of $114bn. His official policy now says only those with criminal records will be deported immediately, although immigration controls will still be massively beefed up. Any undocumented migrants would also face the risk of deportation. 9. Syrian refugees could be a \"Trojan horse\" He says that the Paris attacks prove that even a handful of terrorists posing as migrants could do catastrophic damage, and so he will oppose resettling any Syrians in the US, and deport those who have already been resettled. It's unclear if he still believes that deportations are necessary, though he has still vowed to suspend the intake of Syrian refugees. 10. Vladimir Putin is a \"leader\" He has noted the Russian president's \"great control over his country\" and criticised the state of the relations between it and the US. He told CNN: \"I would probably get along with him very well. And I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now\". More recently he has said that Mr Putin doesn't \"respect\" the US, although that was no reason to get tough on him. 11. Taxes should be reduced for everyone. Trump wants to condense the current seven tax brackets to just three, with no income tax for \"low-income Americans\". He would lower the business tax to 15%, from 35%. He would also allow multinational companies keeping profits overseas to repatriate their cash at a 10% tax rate. 12. Hedge fund managers are \"getting away with murder\" Mr Trump found common ground with Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren when he said that hedge fund managers and the ultra-wealthy did not pay enough taxes. However, after the campaign released specifics of his plan, analysts argued that hedge fund managers would actually get a tax cut along with the middle class. 13. China should be taken to task on a number of trade-related issues. He has said he will make China stop undervaluing its currency, and force it to step up its environmental and labour standards. He is also critical of the county's lax attitude towards American intellectual property and hacking. 14. The Black Lives Matter movement is \"trouble\" Mr Trump mocked former Democratic candidates like Martin O'Malley for apologising to members of the protest movement against police brutality and cast himself as a pro-law enforcement candidate. \"I think they're looking for trouble,\" he once said of the activist group. He also tweeted a controversial and widely debunked graphic purporting to show that African Americans kill white and black people at far higher rates than white people or police officers. 15. He's worth $10bn. Based on Mr Trump's 92-page personal financial disclosure form, Bloomberg calculated last year that the real estate mogul was worth about $2.9bn, while Forbes recently put Trump's net worth at $3.7bn. Mr Trump has however insisted that he is worth \"in excess\" of $10bn. 16. Veteran healthcare in the US needs a major overhaul. Mr Trump wants to clear out the executive level in the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying that waiting times for doctor visits have only increased after previous interventions failed. Thousands of veterans have died while waiting for care, he says. He will invest in the treatment of \"invisible wounds\" like post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He would also increase the number of doctors who specialise in women's health to help care for the increasing number of female veterans. 17. Lobbyists should be more restricted. Mr Trump proposes that there be a five-year ban that prevents government officials and members of congress from leaving and then immediately becoming lobbyists. He also calls for a lifetime ban on senior administration officials from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. 18. He is a \"really nice guy\" In Trump's most recent book, Crippled America, he writes that \"I'm a really nice guy, believe me, I pride myself on being a nice guy but I'm also passionate and determined to make our country great again\". The news site Gawker points out that he calls himself a \"nice guy\" throughout the book, and Mr Trump repeated that self-assessment in his opening monologue on Saturday Night Live and in an interview with the Washington Post. 19. He could not have groped an unattractive woman. A video from 2005 showed Mr Trump making obscene comments about women and triggered numerous claims of alleged sexual harassment. At one rally, he suggested that one of the accusers - a \"horrible woman\" - was not attractive enough for him to have groped: \"I don't think so! I don't think so!\" 20. Tokyo and Seoul should build up nuclear arsenals. He has said Japan and South Korea should not rely on the US so much and would benefit from having their own weapons. Nuclear war between Japan and North Korea may be \"terrible\" but it would be \"pretty quick\". 21. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) is a \"rip-off\" Why? Because the US pays more than anyone else. But he later said he was \"all\" in favour of the alliance. 22. Doctors should be punished for administering abortions. Or should they? In an interview with MSNBC, Mr Trump said that if abortion were to become illegal, women should be punished for obtaining them. He then retracted, saying the doctor would be responsible and he or she should be punished, instead. 23. The Republican National Committee's rules were \"stacked against him\" He called the delegate system \"crooked\" and \"unfair\". He repeatedly clashed with the RNC over its nomination process and how it treated his candidacy during the primaries. He called rules that allowed Senator Ted Cruz to gain more delegates than him in some states \"rigged\", as he did later when talking about the electoral process when polls were showing Hillary Clinton ahead of him. 24. The federal minimum wage should be raised. Workers should be paid more than the current level of $7.25/hour, he has said. though this is another issue he has flip-flopped on repeatedly.

So, before we get all Doctor Who, let's take a look at some top facts about the exciting moon for ET-spotters... Enceladus is the sixth largest moon of Saturn. It is about 500 kilometres (310 miles) in diameter, making it pretty small. In comparison, the Earth is over 12,000 kilometres in diameter. Saturn has many different types of moons, some are very small, and one - Titan - is very, very large! Altogether, Saturn has 62 confirmed moons, 53 of which have names, and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometres. Enceladus is named after a giant from Greek mythology. The name was decided by the son of the man who first discovered it, astronomer Frederick William Herschel. He spotted Enceladus all the way back in 1789, during the first use of his new telescope, which was the largest in the world at the time. Enceladus is covered in a thick surface of ice. But it's what lies deep below this icy surface that has got scientists really excited! It's thought a warm ocean flows below the surface, where the conditions to support life could exist. Jets of water vapour and ice particles erupt from Enceladus' underground ocean through deep icy crevasses called tiger stripes near the moon's south pole. These plumes have provided clues about the planets inner-workings. The Cassini spacecraft conducted a fly-through of the plumes, helping to provide the data that has led scientists to believe the planet could hold life.",

TechCrunch said it was contacted by three college students who said they had uncovered a flaw in the app. \"We can get any Yo user's phone number (I actually texted the founder, and he called me back),\" the students told TechCrunch. \"We can spoof yos from any users, and we can spam any user...

    "document": "Such values are ill-defined and vulnerable to misinterpretation, argued Southend head teacher, Robin Bevan. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) voted to monitor the policing of the requirement, introduced in England by the government last year. Mr Bevan said he had concerns about how the values \"might be interpreted by a future right-wing government\". \"When it comes to the new requirement of promoting fundamental British values, including the role of law, here is one law that I would actively encourage you to disengage from\", Mr Bevan, head of Southend High School for Boys, urged the union's annual conference in Liverpool. The government brought in the requirement in the wake of the Trojan Horse allegations, which suggested there had been attempts by groups of hardline Muslims to take over schools in Birmingham. Earlier this month a committee of MPs said that apart from one incident in one school \"no evidence of extremism or radicalisation was found by any of the inquiries in any of the schools involved\". Requiring schools to promote \"fundamental British values\" could have \"unintended consequences\", according to the text of the motion debated by the conference in Liverpool. \"There is no one in this hall who would argue against the important role that schools and colleges play in promoting personal morality, in developing a sense of civic duty, in fostering engagement with our democratic structures or in embracing a wider global understanding,\" said Mr Bevan. He said schools and colleges had, for a long time, been required to deliver a broad and balanced curriculum addressing issues of behaviour and conduct and placing this within a developmental framework of spiritual, moral and cultural understanding. \"These provisions have existed without controversy for many years and are ample and effective.\" He accused the rules on British values as \"deeply ill-considered\" and \"political posturing\". \"In what way do fundamental British values differ, for example, from French or Swedish ones?\" They change over time, with women now \"allowed\" the vote, said Mr Bevan. \"If these fundamental British values change over time, we can hardly describe them as fundamental.\" But, he argued, the problem was not just one of definition. \"Just take one moment to imagine how fundamental British values might be interpreted by a future right-wing government, or a partner in that government.\" He said he was particularly concerned that Ofsted was being asked to gauge the views of students in order to assess how how well schools actively promote these values. There had already been cases of \"less-skilled inspectors\" doing this in a \"wholly-inappropriate way\", he told journalists later. In particular he was concerned about the difference between \"what is taught and what is learned\", with a proportion of every class apt to misunderstand or ignore lessons, be they about trigonometry or British values. \"I am not sure the government should ever be in the business of dictating values that should be taught in schools - but students should engage in those debates... plurality, that's the way it should be,\" said Mr Bevan.",

A judge in the city of Provo gave her the maximum sentence of at least 30 years and up to life in prison. Police said that the babies were born between 1996 and 2006 and were suffocated or strangled by Huntsman immediately after birth. They said she put the bodies in plastic bags and packed them in boxes in the garage of her home in Pleasant Grove, about 45 miles (75km) south of Salt Lake City. She left the boxes behind when she moved out of the house and they were found by her estranged husband, Darren West, last April. A seventh baby also found there was believed to be stillborn. Police said Huntsman had been a heavy methamphetamine user and \"didn't want the babies\". In court papers she said she wanted to take responsibility for the deaths. Officials said Mr West was the father of the babies but he was not a suspect in the case. He and Huntsman have three other children together. In April 2014 he had just been released after serving eight years in prison for drug crimes and was retrieving some of his belongings from the house when he made the gruesome discovery. A final decision on how long Huntsman will spend behind bars will be made by a parole board. Prosecutors said that she was likely to spend the rest of her life in prison.",

Recording a verdict of accidental death, North Manchester coroner Simon Nelson concluded that something in the sorbet had triggered a fatal reaction.

Rochdale Coroner's Court heard Mrs Thompson, a 50-year-old mother of two, knew eating eggs, milk or apples would make her seriously ill. When she went on holiday to Rhodes in 2012 with her family, she told the hotel's management about her concerns.

He said she went to the hotel room and collapsed. She never regained consciousness. The inquest heard a Greek pathologist later concluded she died of natural causes, probably due to heart failure. Mr Thompson said he always believed his wife died as a result of anaphylactic shock. A British pathologist later confirmed that was indeed the cause of her death, the hearing was told.

He acknowledged this would impact on civilian and military staff but provisions were being made, he said. The sites include an RAF base, barracks, ex-World War Two airfields and a chaplaincy centre. They also include two golf courses at RAF Henlow and Southwick Park in Hampshire. Meanwhile, Network Rail has announced it will release land at almost 200 sites for 12,000 new homes by 2020. This includes 5,000 homes in London, 3,600 homes in Manchester and the north, 1,700 homes in the Midlands and the east of England and 1,400 homes in the south of England. The 13 military sites that will be sold by the MoD are:. The MoD said the land at Venning and Parsons Barracks are the only sites that will not have housing built on them, as they will be used for commercial development at the request of Telford and Wrekin Council. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: \"We are getting rid of land that we don't need to build homes that we do, generating hundreds of millions of pounds in the process. \"Our commitment to protect and increase the budget for our armed forces means that every penny of that will be reinvested into defence, helping to keep Britain safe.\" But shadow defence secretary Clive Lewis said: \"Affordable housing is desperately needed across the UK, particularly by service families, who have seen the cost of their housing go up as conditions get worse. \"So it's disappointing that the MoD has failed to say how many of these potential new homes will be affordable, or how many could be set aside for service personnel. \"In fact, they cannot even reassure us that these sites will be used to build new homes at all,\" he said. \"What we're looking at is the double impact of 18,000 MoD staff losing their jobs and public land potentially being sold on the cheap for developers to profit from,\" a Public and Commercial Services union spokesman said. \"The government must learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure any land sold not only realises its full value, but that house-builders are forced to ensure enough affordable homes are provided.\" In a written statement, Mr Lancaster said consultations will take place over the coming weeks with \"stakeholders\" including trade unions, to determine the future of each site and their occupants. \"The release of land by the MoD has the potential to provide land for new homes and we will continue to engage with impacted local authorities to determine how the department's assessment of housing unit allocation against each site may be considered as part of the authority's Local Plan,\" he said. \"I acknowledge that these moves will have an impact upon civilian and military staff; the department is making arrangements to provide for units and functions based at sites which will not have a future defence requirement.\" An MoD spokeswoman said it was too early to confirm how exactly it would affect staff at the sites, but she said \"the majority\" will be provided for and moved to accommodation elsewhere, for example. Mr Lancaster said the sales would contribute £225m towards the MoD's £1bn target for land release sales, as set out in its spending review last year. The release of the sites contributes to the government commitment to provide land for 160,000 homes by 2020, he said.

    "document": "Currently Britain does not have a national bird, but ornithologist David Lindo believes that should change. A shortlist of 10 birds has been chosen by online voters on his campaign's website from an original list of 60. Mr Lindo will close the vote on the day of the general election, 7 May, and ask the new government to officially appoint the winner as national bird. The RSPB welcomed the initiative and said the lack of a national bird for Britain was a \"glaring omission\". Mr Lindo, the self-styled \"Urban Birder\", told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I want to encourage the great British public to vote for the bird that best represents all that is great about this nation.\" He hoped the appointment could be \"the first act\" of a new government, once the dust has settled from \"the other election\", he told the programme. The robin has emerged as an early favourite, but Mr Lindo, who is backing the blackbird, told Today: \"People consider the robin as a British bird - but [like] a lot of our native birds... some of the population move south to Iberia for the winter and are replaced by immigrants from the continent. \"So the robin you see in your back garden during winter is not necessarily British born.\" And he added: \"It is quite a violent bird.\" A first round of polling on the campaign's website received 70,000 votes. One of England's rarest birds, the hen harrier, is something of a surprise contender, according to Mr Lindo. \"I was expecting 10 garden birds in the list,\" he said, adding that the original pool of 60 candidates included favourites from literature and song such as the turtledove, nightingale and skylark - all of which have dropped out of contention. The hen harrier, which was the subject of a recent campaign because it had been the target of illegal hunting, was down to just one breeding pair a couple of years ago  and \"may already be extinct\", he said. The robin is sometimes mistakenly thought of as the nation's official bird, the RSPB said, after it was given the title unofficially by some enthusiasts in the 1960s. Northern Ireland does not have an official national bird, while the golden eagle and red kite are sometimes regarded as unofficial national symbols of Scotland and Wales respectively. In December 2013 a petition was lodged by the RSPB for the golden eagle to be recognised as Scotland's official national symbol, but the Scottish parliament voted against the plans after it decided the RSPB needed to do more to show greater support for the proposals. The RSPB said it welcomed Mr Lindo's initiative in getting people to discuss their favourite birds. And it said the fact Britain did not already have an official national bird while other countries did was a \"glaring omission\". Grahame Madge, spokesman for the RSPB, said: \"It's opened people's eyes to birds, which is raising awareness. As an organisation we are really behind him. \"It seems most other nations have pipped us to the post in identifying a national bird, and for the UK not to have a national bird when we are a nation of bird lovers does seem to be a glaring omission.\" The shortlist, in pictures:. 1.

    "document": "While ministers claim their Psychoactive Substances Bill reflects the findings of the experts, I am told that the hand-picked committee was divided on whether low-harm substances like amyl nitrate (poppers) and nitrous oxide (laughing gas) should be included. The final report was drafted by Home Office officials but some members of the panel, which included three people who also sit on the ACMD, insisted on writing in what became known as the \"safety-valve\" clause. The recommendation for \"general prohibition\" was amended to say that there should be exemptions for substances \"where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed\".  The line was included specifically to ensure that some low risk products could be excluded from the ban. The coalition government response last October went along with the safety-valve clause saying it would \"explore how to put in place a schedule of exemptions and make provision to add to these where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed\". But when the new Conservative government published the Psychoactive Substances Bill last month, any mention of assessing social harms or health risks had gone.  The safety-valve clause insisted upon by the expert panel had been removed. The Home Office has made it clear that \"there is no provision in the Bill to enable the licensing of so-called low-harm substances\" arguing that there are difficulties in defining low risk and that it might \"send out confusing messages about the safety of new psychoactive substances\". It is likely that this is going to be a major battleground as the controversial bill reaches committee stage in Parliament. The LibDem Home Affairs spokesman Lord Paddick has made it clear his party will oppose the legislation in its current form. \"As drafted, the Bill is far too broad and indiscriminate, further undermining credibility and efficacy in reducing harm,\" he told the House of Lords. The Bill would ban any substance that affects a consumer's \"mental functioning or emotional state\", unless specifically exempted by the Home Secretary.  This definition goes further than the Irish legislation on which the approach is modelled. In Ireland, a psychoactive substance is defined as one that results in \"a significant disturbance in, or significant change to, motor function, thinking, behaviour, perception, awareness or mood\". The word \"significant\" is, of course, significant. It provides the safety valve that excludes low-risk and low-harm products. Whether UK ministers will relent on this issue of a \"safety-valve clause\" is perhaps the biggest question as the Psychoactive Substances Bill makes its progress through Parliament.",

    "document": "Councils in England are facing a £1.1bn shortfall this year, on top of \"almost unendurable\" cuts since 2010, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has warned. Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. \"Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,\" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. \"What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,\" ADASS president Ray James said. \"In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing.\" ADASS called for the government to \"protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community\". But a government spokesman said the survey \"ignores\" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being \"joined up\" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\". \"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. \"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further £1bn coming out of social care budgets was \"chilling\". Sue Brown, vice chairman of the Care and Support Alliance - which represents 80 leading charities - said the figures \"confirm what we already know - that the care system is in worsening crisis\". She said \"chronic underfunding\" of adult social care had seen \"dramatic year-on-year rationing of support, excluding hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people from the care they desperately need\". Janet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: \"This worrying survey shows how the frail and elderly in our society are being hit by year on year cutbacks to council services.\" \"It's vital now more than ever that we have an honest debate about the true costs of providing social care, not just health care,\" she added.",

    "document": "The materials, which can sense pressure as sensitively and quickly as human skin,  have been outlined by two groups reporting in Nature Materials. The skins are arrays of small pressure sensors that convert tiny changes in pressure into electrical signals. The arrays are built into or under flexible rubber sheets that could be stretched into a variety of shapes. The materials could be used to sheath artificial limbs or to create robots that can pick up and hold fragile objects. They could also be used to improve tools for minimally-invasive surgery. In one approach, Ali Javey at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues built up layers of criss-crossed nanometre-scale wires topped with a thin rubber sheet. Together, the stack acts as what is known as a thin-film transistor, or TFT, with a pressure-sensitive layer on top. The amount of electrical current running through the device is dependent upon how much pressure is exerted on the rubber sheet; more pressure allows more current to flow. The team demonstrated the flexibility of their TFT stacks by bending them to a radius smaller than that of a pencil without changing the skin's performance. \"Javey's work is a nice demonstration of their capability in making a large array of nanowire TFTs,\" said Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, whose group demonstrated the second approach. The heart of Professor Bao's devices is micro-structured rubber sheet in the middle of the TFT - effectively re-creating the functionality of the Berkeley group's skins with less layers. \"Instead of laminating a pressure-sensitive resistor array on top of a nanowire TFT array, we made our transistors to be pressure sensitive,\" Professor Bao explained to BBC News. \"Our microstructured rubber can bounce back to its original shape much faster and enable higher sensitivity,\" she added. The overall flexibility of the Stanford group's skins appears to be lower, and Professor Bao concedes that to develop her group's approach further, better conductive rubber will be needed. Nevertheless, both groups demonstrate that their skins can register a pressure in a tenth of a second, over a large range - from five grams per square centimetre to 40 times that high. Those numbers rival the response of human skin, made with relatively inexpensive manufacturing techniques. John Boland, a nanotechnologist from Trinity College Dublin, praised the two approaches in a critique for Nature Materials. \"Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of these studies is how they elegantly demonstrate that it is possible to exploit well-established processing technologies to engineer low-cost innovative solutions to important technical problems,\" he wrote. However, he notes that there are still \"significant opportunities for further innovation\", such as reducing the distance between the sensors in the arrays to maximise the detail they could \"feel\", as well as improvements that could make large-area arrays possible and affordable.",

    "document": "Warning: Readers may find some of the details of violence in this piece distressing. It was late October 2014, and on paper the young banker had lived what could only be described as a privileged and successful life. But over the space of a few drug- and alcohol-fuelled days, he tortured and killed Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, before calling the police to let them know what he had done. In court, lawyers described a much darker side to his apparently gilded existence, one involving drugs, sexual sadism, and an extreme personality disorder. Jutting had tortured Ms Ningsih for three days, before he killed her by slashing her throat over a prolonged period, nearly decapitating her. He then hid her body in a suitcase. A few days later, Jutting brought his second victim, Ms Mujiasih, to his flat. This was a woman he would go on to describe simply as \"the prey\" he had been hunting. \"Sumarti was generous. That much is clear from the evidence in the house. Her driving force was to improve life for her family, to make them richer. Life may be peaceful in the village but she would have been all too aware of the possibilities of a life with more material comforts.\" The story of Sumarti: Born in Indonesia, murdered in Hong Kong. Experts for the defence say Jutting's IQ score is 137 - putting him in the top 1% of the population. But they also diagnosed him with four disorders, which they said combined to lead to the killings:. •Narcissistic personality disorder. •Sexual sadism disorder. •Cocaine use disorder. •Alcohol use disorder. Prosecution witnesses argued that such conditions should not \"substantially\" diminish his ability to control his actions. But according to the defence, when it came to his narcissism, the signs were there from an early age. Jutting was born in London in 1985. His first name Rurik was chosen by his mother, and literally translated as \"great one\" - it was an imperial dynasty in Russia. He described himself as an ambitious boy who had a happy childhood. But even from a young age, Jutting displayed feelings of superiority and entitlement, his defence argued. He was admitted to the prestigious private school Winchester College in his early teens but was disappointed that he ranked sixth in the scholarship selection, rather than first. When his mother expressed delight at his entrance exam results, Jutting commented that he found her reaction \"almost insulting\", because it implied that she was surprised he had got in. There were other troubling episodes. When he was 16, his father tried to take his own life by slashing his wrists while he was in the house. Jutting had to help provide the initial care and go to hospital with him. Jutting also said he had been sexually assaulted by another student while studying at Winchester. In 2003, he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said he experienced suicidal thoughts and that he was affected by knowledge of his parents' marital problems and concerns about his mother's health. Nonetheless, Jutting excelled academically, being admitted to Cambridge University to study history and law at Peterhouse college. A fellow of the college, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC Mr Jutting was ambitious, a keen athlete, committed to his studies and from a stable Catholic background. British banker guilty of murders. Killed by Jutting and forgotten by Indonesia. 'We were lucky it wasn't us' (video) Jutting gained first class honours in his history degree but was disappointed to receive a 2:1 in law, and challenged the examiner's approach. The inability to accept criticism, psychiatrists said, was another sign of his narcissistic personality traits. On graduation, Jutting worked at Barclays bank, before being head-hunted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. His role involved developing complex tax products and, within a few years, his salary had risen to £270,000 ($334,705) per year. But then, things began to go wrong. In 2012, while trying to market a tax product in Luxembourg, auditors began investigating his team for possible violation of regulations, flagging up Jutting in particular as a serious risk to the organisation.  Jutting described this as a \"negative turning point\" in his career and felt his move to Hong Kong the subsequent year had been arranged by bosses to get him out of the way. At one point, his manager told Jutting he was one of the most unpredictable people he had ever worked with. Jutting's alcohol use was also uncontrollable around this time, as he needed to drink excessive amounts in order to get to sleep. His then-girlfriend was so worried about his reliance on alcohol she banned him from drinking at home. He briefly saw a psychiatrist at this point, and said he often felt down and tearful at work. By the time he had moved to Hong Kong in October 2013, he was consuming three quarters of a bottle of vodka to sleep and using cocaine. He said he smuggled cocaine up his rectum on his flight to Hong Kong. Once in Hong Kong, he rented a flat in The J Residence, a luxury development in Wanchai popular with expatriate workers. Although located in a busy street in the heart of the city, the development gives off a sense of exclusivity.  Keycards are needed to access individual floors, while the sheer height of the building, at over 41 floors, means that residents can enjoy views of Hong Kong's skyline - from the bar, garden, and even swimming pool on the roof. But Jutting described himself as feeling increasingly despondent and nihilistic in the city. He did not have much of a social life  and spent long periods drinking at home while playing computer games. Jutting also had extreme sexual interests, and an obsession with sadistic pornography, experts said. He began using sex workers in 2009 and as time went on his behaviour became increasingly forceful. On a number of occasions, he removed condoms during sex without their consent, despite knowing this would constitute rape in the UK. Jutting continued to fantasise about rape and kidnap even while he was remanded in a psychiatric centre after his arrest, prosecution expert Dr Kavin Chow said. By 2014, he was \"spiralling out of control\". He would go on cocaine binges that lasted for days. At one point, he missed a scheduled meeting in London and, as an excuse, he told his boss he had HIV. He developed a round-the-clock craving for the drug, his weight ballooned and in the weeks before the killings took place he stopped going to work. Instead, he spent hours watching and reading violent pornography. He attempted to find men on Grindr to have sex with, later telling a psychologist he had been \"trying to do everything I could to get new experiences\", but described everything as \"disappointing\". On 25 October 2014 Jutting took Ms Ningsih to his flat, after offering to pay her for sex. They had had sex on one occasion before, in a hotel, but things had got so violent that Ms Ningsih asked to end the session early, and refunded half his money. On this second occasion, the sex also switched from consensual to non-consensual, as Jutting began to beat Ms Ningsih. He then held her captive, and tortured her using pliers, his belt, sex toys and his hands. He filmed some of the torture on his phone, in footage that was shown to the jury. The details that follow are distressing and brutal. Jutting claims he drifted in and out of the influence of cocaine: \"When I became relatively less under the influence of cocaine I became quite apologetic - I told her repeatedly I loved her,\" he said in one police interview. Yet, in another interview, he said that he hadn't tortured Ms Ningsih as much as he would have liked, before killing her. He killed her on the third day, after he made her kneel in front of the toilet bowl, with her hands tied behind her back, and lick the bowl. He then cut her throat with a knife but Ms Ningsih did not die immediately, so her dragged her into the shower and continued. Jutting recorded several videos describing the aftermath of the killing on his phone.  Eventually, he wrapped up the body and placed it into a suitcase, which he left on the balcony. Jutting began planning to torture a second victim on 31 October.  He bought tools, including sandpaper, nails and a blow torch, filming them on his iPhone, describing how he might use them to torture a victim. That night, he went out and met Ms Mujiasih, inviting her back to his flat for sex. They began kissing and cuddling on the sofa but Ms Mujiasih began shouting when she saw a gag by the sofa. Jutting held a knife against her throat, telling her he would kill her if she continued to struggle. She continued struggling, and he killed her by slashing at her neck. He later told police: \"She was simply, the word I'd use is prey. I was hunting for prey and she was unfortunately the person who was hunted\". After taking more cocaine, he says he contemplated taking his own life. He eventually called 999. He also called his boss, saying: \"I'm in a lot of trouble, you need to do something about the reputation of the bank.\" Even though he had not been to work in the two weeks leading up to the killings, the office was still on his mind. After he killed Ms Ningsih, he changed the out-of-office message from his work email to: \"I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody. [Last line only really worked if I had followed through..]\" On one occasion, according to an expert witness, Jutting likened his life to The Truman Show, a movie starring Jim Carrey about a man who's entire life, unbeknownst to him, is a TV show. This too may reflect his narcissism because Jutting wanted to believe that \"his life was so significant that… millions of people would be interested in watching it\". He is now likely to spend much if not all of it in jail.",

The CIA said there was \"no indication\" that anything classified was released. But the documents do include a draft security clearance application containing personal information.

He was working in the private sector at the time, having already spent 25 years working for the CIA between 1980 and 2005. A high-school student claimed he was responsible for hacking the AOL account, telling Nthe New York Post he was protesting against US foreign policy.

The documents published by Wikileaks include a draft on national security challenges said to have been created in 2007.

The woman was arrested by detectives investigating the child's death following an incident in Belfast in March. She was charged with murder and then held under the Mental Health Act. Her barrister revealed on Wednesday that a medical report had now been prepared. Based on its contents he sought a termination of the current arrangements for keeping his client at the facility. \"The application is that she be remanded on bail, subject to the condition that she continues to reside (there),\" he said. A doctor who assessed the accused confirmed that the health trust consented to the proposal, provided the accused was there as a detained person. The judge was informed that under those arrangements the woman would not be able to leave. Granting the application, she listed the criminal proceedings for a further update in eight weeks time.",

The judges said the book \"takes us into the hearts and minds of the Welsh Guards in a way that is both interesting and visceral\". \"It challenges every citizen of this country to examine exactly what we're asking soldiers to do in Afghanistan,\" the panel continued. \"Rather than offering easy answers it lets the soldiers speak for themselves.\" Other awards presented included a posthumous honour for Christopher Hitchens, whose final book, Arguably, was included on the long list for the top prize. Hitchens' widow Carol Blue accepted the award on behalf of the Vanity Fair writer. The journalism prize was awarded to Amelia Gentleman for her work in The Guardian, while the blog award went to Rangers Tax Case - an online commentary on the ongoing financial problems at the historic Scottish football club. The writers of the blog said they aimed to \"provide the details of what Rangers FC have done, why it was illegal and what the implications are for one of the largest football clubs in Britain\".

The move, if enacted, would make them the first UK banks to introduce negative interest rates, in effect, charging to deposit money. \"Global interest rates remain at very low levels... this could result in us charging interest on credit balances,\" it wrote in a letter to customers. Personal customers are not affected. However, charities and community groups are counted as business clients and so would be affected by the changes, the banks said. A spokesperson for Royal Bank of Scotland, which owns NatWest, told the BBC the letter was sent to just under 1.3 million of the combined business and commercial customers of the two banks. \"We will consider any necessary action in the event of the Bank of England base rate falling below zero, but will do our utmost to protect our customers from any impacts,\" they said. Jack: The weird world of negative interest rates. The Federation of Small Businesses, which has 170,000 members, called on other banks to update customers of any changes to their Business Current Account (BCA) \"during this uncertain economic period\". Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said the warning from Natwest and RBS \"will be deeply concerning to small firms\". The FSB also urged the Bank of England to consider the impact on smaller firms of cutting interest rates. Mike Amey, a managing director at investment firm Pimco, said the two banks were \"giving themselves wiggle room in the very unlikely event\" that the Bank turns the official interest rate negative. \"The Bank of England sets the interest rate next week, so the fact they put this out this week... is possibly a bit of a reminder to the Bank of England there are negative consequences,\" he told the BBC. UK interest rates have been unchanged since the Bank of England cut them to a record low of 0.5% in March 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. The Bank kept them on hold earlier this month, despite speculation it would cut rates further. But Bank governor Mark Carney has said it is likely \"some monetary policy easing\" will be required to boost the UK economy in response to the Brexit vote. However, he has said he does not favour rates falling any lower than 0.25%. Nevertheless, some economists believe that rates could still be cut to zero or lower later this year. When the rate goes below zero, the normal relationship between banks and customers is reversed. Instead of the lender getting paid interest by the bank for allowing it to use their money, the lender has to pay the bank for holding their money. The underlying idea is much the same as cutting interest rates in more normal times. The aim is to encourage more borrowing and spending by firms and less saving. In 2014, the European Central Bank was the first major central bank to introduce negative interest rates, with the aim of encouraging banks to lend to businesses rather than hold on to money.",

He said the move was \"apparently\" in response to him saying the party's current leadership \"couldn't knock the skin off a rice pudding\". But a spokesman said his membership had lapsed earlier this year. And party leader Paul Nuttall said the businessman - who has suggested he should be made party chairman to shake up the party's policymaking and campaigning - was causing \"negative and damaging publicity\". In a letter to Mr Banks, Mr Nuttall said the party's ruling NEC had agreed to meet the businessman later this month to discuss his ideas but this invitation could be withdrawn if he continued to criticise UKIP and its leadership. He added: \"I should make clear that, whilst I am open to working with you on improving and enhancing our party, the party chairmanship is not on offer.\" Mr Banks, who gave Â£1m to the party ahead of the 2015 general election, has been sceptical about the leadership of Paul Nuttall and has recently spoken of founding a new political movement to \"drain the swamp\" of Westminster politics. He also suggested he could stand against Douglas Carswell, UKIP's only MP, by using a recall petition to trigger a by-election in his Clacton constituency. But Mr Carswell played down the importance of Mr Banks' announcement, telling the BBC: \"It's always very sad when one of UKIP's 40,000 members leaves the party for whatever reason.\" Referencing previous claims that he had prevented former UKIP leader Nigel Farage from being knighted, Mr Carswell added: \"I have no more say in NEC decisions at UKIP than I do in who gets a knighthood.\" On Mr Banks' suggestion that he could stand against Mr Carswell in Clacton at the next general election, the MP said: \"Each time I've stood there've been some wonderfully colourful characters on the ballot paper. \"I even had a chap who changed his name by deed poll to Lord Ha Ha Woof Woof. I'm sure at the next election there'll be some colourful characters too - the more the merrier.\" Apology to squash clubs.

Britain has a tough job on and it will be far harder in a climate of bitterness and division. The campaign itself was unedifying to many. The standing of politicians was frighteningly low before the referendum and one suspects their stock will not have been raised by the events of the last few months. The institutions and public servants whose expertise and motives were called into question at times during the campaign are going to be key to guiding Britain through the turbulent times ahead. The British people must have confidence in their system of governance and their precious democracy at this uncertain time. We have proved to be remarkably resilient in the past.

    "document": "NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh says he worries they will put vulnerable people \"at risk\", while chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies says they will \"inevitably lead to patients suffering\" and Health Minister Ben Gummer claims they will be put in \"harm's way\". It's easy to understand why. On 26 and 27 April junior doctors will stop providing emergency cover - unlike in the previous strikes in the contract dispute. It means as well as downing tools for their routine duties, medics will walk out of A&E units and intensive care departments, leaving some of the sickest and most vulnerable patients in the hands of others. But will the reality of the all-out strike be really as bad as the rhetoric? After all, the doctors' code of conduct produced by the General Medical Council decrees they must not harm patients or put them at risk. And the British Medical Association is adamant the stoppages do not breach this code because of the contingency plans being put in place. The union is legally bound to give the NHS seven days' notice of industrial action. In this case the health service has had five weeks. The time has allowed hospital bosses to carefully consider what they need and put plans in place. This has been done in partnership with BMA reps, while at a national level Department of Health and NHS England officials have been meeting regularly to ensure the contingency arrangements are satisfactory . And as yet no hospital has yet said it cannot cope. This is because large chunks of the routine work has been postponed and staff will be redeployed into emergency areas. There will be consultants, staff doctors - those who are not in training but have not yet reached consultant level - nurses, midwives and health care assistants in work. GPs are also being asked to keep a greater number of appointments free for urgent on-the-day cases than normal, while patients will be warned in the lead-up to the strike to think carefully about how they use the health service during the stoppages. The result is that there are plenty of people who think the system will run pretty smoothly. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Royal College of Emergency Medicine have both released statements saying they are satisfied with the arrangements being put in place. In fact, you could argue the result in some departments may be that the system may actually work better than on a normal day. Take A&E, for example. Having more consultants on the floor could actually speed up the flow of patients as they will be able to make quick decisions about the care patients need. Although there is an argument the smaller hospitals with fewer consultants may find it more difficult. Meanwhile, in emergency surgery and intensive care the presence of consultants should, in theory, more than make up for the absence of the juniors. Also, it should be remembered that the stoppages are from 08:00 to 17:00 BST - not for 24 or 48 hours as the previous strikes have been - so there will be some respite during the two days. Instead, the problems might be more run of the mill. Junior doctors play a vital role chasing up test results, ordering x-rays, taking bloods, ordering prescriptions and preparing patients for discharge. Consultants may not have the time to do some of these, their skills may be a little rusty or they may simply not know their way round the system to get on top of the jobs. Senior nurses will be able to take some of the strain, but there is bound to be disruption. However, that doesn't mean the concerns being voiced are not justified. Talking to those who work in the service, there does seem to be a weak spot. It concerns what happens if there is an unexpected emergency on a general or surgical ward or perhaps in a psychiatric unit. When a patient collapses, a junior doctor would normally be one of the first on the scene. If they aren't there and a patient dies, questions will be naturally asked.  And this, perhaps, is the crux of the matter. It was a point made by Prof Lord Darzi of Denham, a surgeon and former health minister, in an article in the Daily Telegraph.. He wrote that every family afflicted with heartbreak on the strike days \"would always wonder\" whether loved ones would have lived if junior doctors had been there. Trust between doctors and society might be \"irreparably damaged\", he warned. This blog was first published on 15 April, but has since been updated to take into account subsequent developments.

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The Nobel committee praised him for a peace deal signed with Farc rebels, but rejected by Colombians in a vote. Mr Santos said he dedicated the award to \"all the victims of the conflict\", and the Farc leader congratulated him. About 260,000 people have been killed and more than six million internally displaced in Colombia. The award did not include Farc leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, who also signed the accord. The head of the Nobel commitee said the award recognised the president's \"resolute efforts\" to end the conflict. \"The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the  parties who have contributed to the peace process,\" Kaci Kullman Five added. Sources: BBC Monitoring, Colombian presidency. Mr Santos said on Twitter: \"This honourable distinction is not for me, it's for all the victims of the conflict. Together we'll win the most important award of them all: peace.\" The peace deal was rejected by 50.2% of voters who went to the polls on 2 October. The committee acknowledged the result, saying: \"What the 'No' side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement.\" It also said that finding a balance between the need for reconciliation and ensuring justice for the victims would be a difficult challenge. Also on Twitter, Farc leader Timochenko said: \"I congratulate President Juan Manuel Santos, Cuba and Norway, who sponsored the process, and Venezuela and Chile, who assisted it, without them, peace would be impossible.\" Earlier, he had written: \"The only prize we aspire to is peace with social justice for Colombia, without (right-wing) paramilitary groups, without retaliation or lies. Peace in the streets.\" This was a Peace Prize for a peace deal that wasn't. President Santos joins a long line of Nobel Peace Prize winners who have been rewarded for effort as much as achievement. But it is too easy to be cynical. The Nobel Peace Prize has often been controversial. In recent years a variety of international bureaucracies have won - the EU, the IAEA and the OPCW. Why, some have argued, should people get a prize for simply doing their job? What, others ask, had US President Barack Obama actually done to merit the prize in 2009, other than be elected? But the Nobel has often gone to extraordinary individuals who really have gone above and beyond to bring peace - in Northern Ireland and East Timor to name just two examples. Maybe the award to President Santos may yet galvanise public opinion in Colombia to think again about the deal. Critics, led by former president Alvaro Uribe, said the deal was too lenient to the rebels. Under the agreement, special courts would have been created to try crimes committed during the conflict. Those who confessed would have received lighter sentences and avoided serving any time in conventional prisons. The Farc would also have been guaranteed 10 seats in the Colombian Congress in the 2018 and 2022 elections. Despite the rejection by voters, Mr Santos vowed to continue with talks with the rebels. Government negotiators have already returned to the Cuban capital Havana for further discussions with Farc leaders. Kaci Kullman Five, from the Nobel committee, said the award was also meant as \"encouragement\" to the rebels. \"Giving the prize to Santos is not a belittlement to any of the other parties. \"The Farc is obviously a very important part of this process.'' 1964: Set up as armed wing of Communist Party. 2002: At its height, it had an army of 20,000 fighters controlling up to a third of the country.

Arsenal have been drawn alongside Paris St-Germain, Basel and Ludogorets, with Tottenham facing Monaco, CSKA Moscow and Bayer Leverkusen. Spanish side Real Madrid beat neighbours Atletico on penalties in last season's final, becoming European champions for a record 11th time. Zinedine Zidane's side meet German outfit Borussia Dortmund, Portugal's Sporting Lisbon and Legia Warsaw of Poland. Guardiola, who replaced Manuel Pellegrini at the end of last season, is Barcelona's most successful boss, leading the Spanish club to 14 major trophies between 2008 and 2012. He helped the Catalans, who are five-time European champions, win the Champions League in 2009 and 2011. After leaving the Nou Camp, the former Spain midfielder took charge of German side Bayern Munich and lost to his former side in the 2014-15 Champions League semi-finals. City, who lost to champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals last season, qualified for the group stage thanks to a 6-0 aggregate win over Romania's Steaua Bucharest. As well as facing Barcelona for a third time in four seasons, City also return to Monchengladbach, whom they beat home and away in last season's group stage. \"It is not a nightmare draw because we are in a wonderful competition - but it is a very tough group,\" City director of football Txiki Begiristain said. \"Pep knows the group very well - obviously Barcelona but also Borussia Monchengladbach from his time in Germany.\" Leicester produced one of the great sporting shocks to win last season's Premier League title and qualify for the Champions League for the first time. The Foxes' last involvement in European football saw them knocked out of the Uefa Cup in the first round by Red Star Belgrade in 2000. Claudio Ranieri's side could have been drawn in a group with last season's beaten finalists Atletico Madrid, Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven and Turkish league winners Besiktas. Although they face Portuguese champions Porto, who have reached the group stage for a sixth successive season, Belgian title winners Club Brugge and Danish champions FC Copenhagen have shown little Champions League pedigree in recent years. Brugge are competing in the group stage for the first time since 2005-06, while Copenhagen are 81st in Uefa's club rankings. \"With the history of all the clubs we could have been drawn against, it was always going to be an interesting draw,\" said Foxes director of football Jon Rudkin. \"These are three very established European football clubs and strong teams.\" Russian side Rostov - the only other Champions League debutants this season - face Atletico and German champions Bayern Munich. Tottenham mark their return to European football's top competition for the first time in six seasons, while Arsenal will aim to qualify for the knockout stages for a 13th successive year. Spurs, who reached the quarter-finals in 2010-11 with wins over both Milan clubs, have avoided the European heavyweights despite being drawn in pot three. With White Hart Lane's capacity reduced as work begins on a new stadium, Tottenham will play their Champions League games at Wembley this season. Their toughest test is likely to come against Russian champions CSKA Moscow, the 2005 Uefa Cup winners. \"We know very well that Russia is always difficult and CSKA are sure to have a very good team,\" said Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino. Arsenal, who reached the last 16 last season, and PSG will be favourites to progress from Group A. French champions PSG knocked Chelsea out in the last 16 before losing to Manchester City, but have not met Arsenal since the 1993-94 Cup Winners' Cup semi-final.

Shortly after his arrest, Islamabad released a video in which he was shown admitting involvement in spying. India has always questioned the alleged confession, saying that it was extracted under duress. There are differing accounts of how and where Kulbhushan Jadhav was detained. Pakistan says he was detained on 3 March 2016 in the restive Balochistan province, which has been hit by a separatist insurgency that Islamabad accuses India of backing. India says he was kidnapped by Pakistan while he was in Iran. Speaking in the Indian parliament on Tuesday, Ms Swaraj described the death sentence as \"an indefensible verdict\" and warned Pakistan to \"consider the consequences\". Home Minister Rajnath Singh promised that the government would do \"whatever it takes to make sure Mr Jadhav gets justice\". On Monday, Pakistan said he had been tried by a military court and sentenced to death. Pakistan said he told the court he had been ordered to \"plan, coordinate, and organise espionage/sabotage activities aiming to destabilise and wage war against Pakistan\". He has 40 days to appeal to the court, Pakistani media report. No date was given for his execution. The nuclear-armed neighbours have a long history of diplomatic spats and Delhi and Islamabad often accuse each other of sending spies into their territories.

    "document": "Giving people the right to buy their council houses and shares in previously nationalised firms such as British Telecom and British Gas were among the initiatives that won her much support. But some believe that other changes, such as those that made mortgages and credit much easier to get, sowed the seeds of future crises that still affect many to this day. Here, BBC reporters look at some of the changes that, for better or worse, have changed our finances forever. By Brian Milligan, personal finance reporter, BBC News. The Right to Buy Scheme for council houses was one of Margaret Thatcher's most popular policies. It was enshrined in the Housing Act of 1980, making it one of her first major pieces of legislation after she came to office in 1979. The number of people who bought their council house from their local authorities rose to 200,000 by 1982, and again peaked at 180,000 in 1989, her last full year as prime minister. Since the Housing Act came into force, it is estimated that some two million homes have been sold to former council tenants. The sale price was based on market valuation, but included substantial discounts, depending on how long a tenant had been living there. When Labour came to power in 1997, it reduced the value of such discounts in areas where councils were running short of housing stock. Critics said the policy resulted in speculators buying up valuable housing stock too cheaply. The Right to Buy Scheme was extended in the March 2013 Budget, as the government vowed to increase sales once again. By Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent, BBC News. Before Mrs Thatcher arrived at No 10, British passports contained a special page to record the amount of cash travellers took out of the country. The page was one of the first things to be scrapped by the new government, as the Tories moved to abolish exchange controls. The Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, raised travel allowances to £1,000 per trip and permitted overseas property purchases of up to £100,000. On the tax front, the basic rate was cut by 3p to 30p in the pound, while the highest rate came down from 83p to 60p. But Thatcher's chancellors not only cut income tax, but also changed the way we pay tax. To fund lower taxes on incomes, up went tax on most things shoppers bought. VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8% to 15%. Within a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25%, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40%. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor. With money from tax cuts in their pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the \"feelgood factor\". They were encouraged further as credit was unleashed. Restrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s. And, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window. Building societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete. The Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years. Mrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988. The new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, they backfired. The promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions. Compensating the victims cost the pensions industry £11bn. More successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to £6,000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break. To complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax-free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa. The idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have £390bn salted away. By John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News. Few senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that her reforms had on the power of the movement. She was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as  collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike. The Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job. Secret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day. In 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million. The miners' strike of 1984-85 came to symbolise the government's battle with the unions. The year-long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police. In the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever. Unions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish their power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress-affiliated unions. One of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged. By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News. A policy of privatising the UK's large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such it was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had their critics. The recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership. By the end of its first term, it had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable & Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later. This led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK. One of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986. The promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to \"tell Sid\" about the chance to buy shares at \"affordable\" prices. Anyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid. Privatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing. It also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies. Yet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s. In 1981, 28% was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20% by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11% by the end of 2010. By Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News. The impact of one of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK. The so-called \"Big Bang\", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange. The most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face. Big Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading. It also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen's club, ruled by restrictive practices. (It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.) Before Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor. Price competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm. At best it was a self-regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at its worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping. Big Bang saw many of the City's historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy  jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one-stop shops. This, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses. Big Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share-buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into their banks and order a parcel of shares. But while it made dealing and investing easier, it also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.",

North Wales could benefit from better transport links and growth potential and the Welsh government had been supporting the development, he said. But Sir Richard also said the region \"needed more freedom\". \"Devolution to Wales has to go beyond the Welsh assembly,\" he told the BBC's Wales At Work programme. \"I'd argue Cardiff and its city region ought to be able to do some of the things we're doing in Greater Manchester. \"North Wales again needs to be given more power by the Welsh assembly to enable it to work better with us in the north of England.\" \"From the discussions I've had in north Wales, the growth potential is enormous but it's more likely to be realised if we can work out those synergies between what's happening in north Wales and just the other side of the border. \"They need to be given the freedom by the Welsh assembly to do that.\" The cities of the \"Northern Powerhouse\" stretch from Manchester and Liverpool to Sheffield, Leeds and Hull and up to Newcastle and Sunderland in the north east. Radical improvements to transport connections over the next 15 to 20 years could create a single labour market and \"virtual city\" of 15 million in the north of England, which could provide an economic counter-balance to London. Sir Richard, who is also chair of the Core Cities cabinet which includes Cardiff, said north Wales could also benefit from that and there was a recognition in Cardiff Bay that the links between north Wales and northern England were more important than those with south Wales. Sir Richard said energy production, advanced manufacturing and health innovation and digital industries were not just based in the urban cores and some of these sectors already existed in north Wales. \"North Wales has the opportunity to play into and contribute to those sectoral strengths of the north of England. \"For industry in north Wales its route to market is through the North of England. So what we're do to improve transport connections, there's a shared interest in extending that beyond the north of England.\" He said care had to be taken with comparisons, as Wales had the same population as Greater Manchester but he said areas like transport and business support might benefit from greater devolution within Wales. Tracy North, chair of the CBI in north Wales said company owners and managers wanted to be involved with the Northern Powerhouse but there was not an obvious body or mechanism for doing so. \"The CBI wants the next Welsh government to create a regional development corporation for north Wales,\" she said. \"It would need to be set up immediately after the election. It would have funding and staff, run in partnership with business and be unencumbered by local red tape. \"This way, the north Wales region can act independently to optimise economic opportunities, without going through the impracticality of discussing and voting on devolution, which would out of necessity take years and years.\" A Wales Office spokesman said it was committed to delivering a fundamental shift of power from Westminster to the people and communities of this country and wanted the Welsh government to \"have the same confidence and faith in Wales\". \"Only by giving local areas the powers and freedom they need can we further drive economic growth and create the jobs and investment opportunities this country needs,\" he said. The Welsh government said: \"As part of the Mersey Dee Alliance, we already recognise the economic importance of cross border working and links. We will work with the UK Government to ensure north Wales has full potential to exploit the maximum economic advantage from any Northern Powerhouse proposals.\"",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Scientists have found that two types of chemicals called neonicotinoids and coumaphos are interfering with the insect's ability to learn and remember. Experiments revealed that exposure was also lowering brain activity, especially when the two pesticides were used in combination. The research is detailed in two papers in Nature Communications and the Journal of Experimental Biology. But a company that makes the substances said laboratory-based studies did not always apply to bees in the wild. And another report, published by the Defra's Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), concluded that there was no link between bee health and exposure to neonicotinoids. The government agency carried out a study looking at bumblebees living on the edges of fields treated with the chemicals. Falling numbers. Honey bees around the world are facing an uncertain future. They have been hit with a host of diseases, losses of habitat, and in the US the mysterious Colony Collapse Disorder has caused numbers to plummet. Now researchers are asking whether pesticides are also playing a role in their decline. To investigate, scientists looked at two common pesticides:  neonicotinoids, which are used to control pests on oil seed rape and other crops, and a group of organophosphate chemicals called coumaphos, which are used to kill the Varroa mite, a parasite that attacks the honey bee. Neonicotinoids are used more commonly in Europe, while coumaphos are more often employed in the United States. Work carried out by the University of Dundee, in Scotland, revealed that if the pesticides were applied directly to the brains of the pollinators, they caused a loss of brain activity. Dr Christopher Connolly said: \"We found neonicotinoids cause an immediate hyper-activation - so an epileptic type activity - this was proceeded by neuronal inactivation, where the brain goes quiet and cannot communicate any more.  The same effects occur when we used organophosphates. \"And if we used them together, the effect was additive, so they added to the toxicity: the effect was greater when both were present.\" Another series of laboratory-based experiments, carried out at Newcastle University, examined the behaviour of the bees. The researchers there found that bees exposed to both pesticides were unable to learn and then remember floral smells associated with a sweet nectar reward - a skill that is essential for bees in search of food. Dr Sally Williamson said: \"It would imply that the bees are able to forage less effectively, they are less able to find and learn and remember and then communicate to their hive mates what the good sources of pollen and nectar are.\" 'No threat' She said that companies that are manufacturing the pesticides should take these findings into account when considering the safety of the chemicals. She explained: \"At the moment, the initial tests for bee toxicity are giving the bees an acute dose and then watching them to see if they die. \"But because bees do these complex learning tasks, they are very social animals and they have a complex behavioural repertoire, they don't need to be killed outright in order not to be affected.\" The European Commission recently called for a temporary moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids after a report by the European Food Safety Authority concluded that they posed a high acute risk to pollinators. But 14 out of the 27 EU nations - including the UK and Germany - opposed the ban, and the proposal has now been delayed. Ian Boyd, chief scientist at Defra, said: \"Decisions on the use of neonicotinoids must be based on sound scientific evidence.\" He said that the results of the Fera bumblebee study suggested that the extent of the impact might not be as high as some studies had suggested - and called for \"further data based on more realistic field trials is required\". Dr Julian Little, communications and government affairs manager at Bayer Crop Science Limited, which makes some of the pesticides, said the findings of laboratory-based studies should not be automatically extrapolated to the field. \"If you take an insecticide and you give it directly to an insect, I can guarantee that you will have an effect - I am not at all surprised that this is what you will see,\" he explained. \"What is really important is seeing what happens in real situations - in real fields, in real bee colonies, in real bee hives, with real bee keepers.\"",

Flint Community Hospital could be closed under plans by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) to reorganise its services in north Wales. Campaigners joined a protest march from the hospital to attend the public meeting at the town hall. In a statement BCUHB said retaining the status quo was \"not an option\". The health board, which predicts a financial shortfall of Â£64.6m this year, revealed details of its proposed shake-up in July. Under plans being considered Blaenau Ffestiniog community hospital could also close and minor injury accident departments may shut at other locations. Neo-natal intensive care may also be transferred over the border to England as part of the proposed shake-up. Shortly after the plans were made public GPs in the area revealed their concerns about the effects of proposed cuts on community services. Mark Scriven, the health board's medical director, said there was sound reasoning behind the proposals to close Flint hospital. \"The thinking generally about the problems we're trying to address in these proposals with community hospitals is that some of them are very old, and they have poor fabric,\" he told BBC Radio Wales. He said it was not just the furnishings that were not up to scratch, the physical space did not suit modern health care. \"A lot of them, and the services they provide, are underused, and certainly the minor injuries unit at Flint hospital is underused, which is important because it doesn't allow the nurses running it to maintain their experience according to their professional bodies,\" added Mr Scriven.

They have systematically dropped the services from this town.\" Mr Reece described BCUHB's plans as a new version of old proposals by the Flintshire Health Board which had already been rejected by the Welsh government. Explaining the reasons behind its proposed shake-up, BCUHB said it was clear that it could not afford to stand still. \"The status quo is not an option,\" the board said. \"The proposals we are now making are intended to change the way in which services are provided and where they are provided to ensure patient safety and meet quality standards. \"The proposals will allow us to attract and retain the professional clinical staff we need and control our costs when public finances are decreasing.\" BCUHB said its consultation exercise would run until 28 October, and it would also take account of the views of the community health council and any views they have heard from the public before making decisions. Any changes would start in early 2013, it said.",

The men needed regular visits because they could suffer a relapse which could put the public at risk. Ms Doherty denied any wrongdoing but three allegations were found proven. A fourth charge of acting \"dishonestly\" was found not proven. The hearing was told Ms Doherty worked for Vale of Glamorgan council as a senior social worker and had years of experience. Part of her job was to make sure people who had committed \"significant crimes\" but were living in the community, complied with Crown Court orders issued under the Mental Health Act. Ms Doherty said visits had happened every six weeks but council mental health services manager Andrew Cole, giving evidence on the first of a two-day hearing, said the visits were less frequent. \"[This led] to a potential increased risk of somebody's mental health deteriorating and an escalation in their behaviour - which is more likely to go undetected,\" he said. Mr Cole also said the minimum four-week frequency of visits was set by doctors and would have been \"clearly marked\" on official documents. In her evidence, Ms Doherty told the panel she often had an excessive work-load, inadequate management support and often felt \"left out on a limb\". The hearing was also told that bereavement had caused her to \"burn out\" and that her life had become \"chaotic\" as a result. Ms Doherty, who had been subject to a suspension order since the allegations came to light in 2014, told the hearing she was not seeking to return to social care. A report by the care watchdog said: \"The committee finds that only a Removal Order will be adequate in this case given the seriousness of the impairment.\"",

The small island in the Pacific is home to an important strategic US airbase, US nuclear bombers and about 6,000 troops along with some 165,000 civilians.

But Ms Baza added that the Guam Homeland Security Office \"did say that if there were any threat they would put out a mass public notification via the emergency broadcasting system\". It is not the first time the small island has found itself named as a potential target for North Korean rockets - aside from US military bases in South Korea or Japan, the Pacific island is the closest target for Pyongyang should the regime want to attack the US.

    "document": "MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer looks at the reasons why Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side won the Premier League by such a convincing margin and explains why it will be hard to stop them achieving more success. Every part of their team did their bit but the biggest reason for their success is one man, Jose Mourinho. His influence was huge. Media playback is not supported on this device. The Blues manager is a serial winner who lives for titles and trophies - and he knows exactly how to get what he wants. I don't accept the 'boring boring Chelsea' jibes his side have faced recently. I think that is utter rubbish. It is not Chelsea's problem if teams cannot beat them, and it is pretty embarrassing if they then call them boring. The only tag the Blues deserve is 'worthy champions' because that is what they are. Everyone else has a lot of catching up to do. One of the biggest reasons Chelsea won the title is that, unlike his rivals, Mourinho identified what he needed last summer, and went out and got it. I am sure he was hurt by what happened to Chelsea last season, his first back at Stamford Bridge since his last spell ended in 2007. Despite not having a really top-class centre-forward they went very close to winning the title. Near-misses don't mean anything to Mourinho, though. He addressed the main issue holding his side back by signing Diego Costa, who has scored the goals that were missing. Chelsea were also lacking a bit of guile in midfield, and Cesc Fabregas has provided the extra creativity there. His midfield partnership with Nemanja Matic, who Mourinho signed in January 2014 to sit and police the back four, is just one part of a team system that works perfectly. Chelsea have some top players, but their squad also has a great hunger and desire. That is down to their manager. By the end of the season, Chelsea will have broken the record for the most days spent on top of the table, and also the most consecutive days. They were joint-top with Manchester City at the start of January but, since they kicked their first ball of the campaign, the only time they have not been at the summit was after the second round of games. Their players had the character to deal with it. From August onwards, they have been the team to beat and the best team full-stop. That underlines their consistency over the last nine months, and shows the almost total control they have had on the title race. Even when they were hit for five by Tottenham on New Year's Day, no panic set in. That was one of their very few bad days, which are inevitable over a long season, but they never suffered a slump for a sustained period of time. They have never had to play catch-up in the title race and are not used to doing it in individual games either. Again, they are usually in control. They have scored the first goal in 27 out of their 35 league matches, which is obviously important for any team, but especially for Chelsea. When you have a defence like they do, they are very rarely pegged back when they get in front. I keep hearing that players need to be rested and rotated but Chelsea don't do it, and their approach seems to have helped rather than hindered them. Instead, Mourinho uses a core group of players who start whenever they are available. That includes Eden Hazard, who is hardly ever taken off either, something that is rare for an attacking player. At the back, John Terry has been magnificent and he has played every single minute of every league game. Media playback is not supported on this device. The rest of the back four - Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Cesar Azpilicueta - play whenever they are fit. Compare them to, say, Manchester City who chop and change their defence a lot and you can see the benefit of a settled unit who work relentlessly together. Chelsea have had 17 clean sheets out of 35 league games, and they have only conceded more than two goals twice. They were pretty good at the back in the first half of the season when they were scoring goals freely. Until 17 January, only Southampton had conceded fewer goals. But in the past few weeks when they have been more pragmatic in the way they have been getting results, they have been even better at the back. From August to January, Chelsea played some sparkling football and you only have to look at their attacking statistics to see that they were anything but dull. So they earned the right to play the way they have been in the last few weeks, when they have been protecting their lead at the top of the table. I put that change in approach down to form and fitness of some of their players, with Costa's absence being the obvious example. The important thing was that Chelsea kept winning, though, and they have done that. None of their rivals have managed it over the duration of the season and the way I would sum up this campaign is that Chelsea have been brilliant and the rest of the league has not been good enough - by quite a margin. City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool have all been disappointing, especially when you look at the money they have spent, because they are further away from Chelsea now than they have been for a while. Chelsea have done the job they set out to do at the start of the season, which is to win the title. They have the best defensive record in the Premier League and only City have scored more goals. They also have the best player, Hazard. Put all of that together and I just cannot accept they are dull. They have not got the credit they deserve but I don't think that bothers Mourinho one iota. Media playback is not supported on this device. The only thing that matters to him is winning the Premier League, and he has done that with ease. He has his third title in English football, and now he will want more. He can get that with this Chelsea team, which certainly does not need much work done to it over the summer. I am pretty sure a centre-forward will be high on Mourinho's shopping list because we have seen how much they have missed Costa when he has been out. Also, Didier Drogba is 37 now and I am not sure how long he can keep going. But the main thing for Chelsea is that Mourinho is not going anywhere - while he is around, there are more trophies to come. Alan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "document": "Det Ch Supt Lesley Boal said Police Scotland officers were investigating a historical complaint - but did not confirm a name. Lord Janner was accused of abuse allegations during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s - but was deemed unfit to stand trial in England because of dementia. The former MP has consistently denied all allegations against him. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the allegation had first been made in 1991 by a Leicester man who told police that Greville Janner sexually abused him during the 1970s - including in Scotland. Police in Leicestershire investigated allegations against the politician - who represented two constituencies in Leicester between 1970 and 1997 - in the 1990s but no charges were brought, he added. However Scottish police have reviewed files from the original claim relating to the alleged abuse in Scotland and are now carrying out their own investigation, our correspondent said. \"Because Scotland has a separate and independent prosecutor, it would be able to make its own decision about whether to charge Lord Janner,\" he added. In April, the Director of Public Prosecutions in England and Wales, Alison Saunders, decided allegations against the peer by nine men were strong enough to merit a prosecution. However, she said the prosecution should not go ahead because Lord Janner would to be unable to take part in his defence due to his poor health. Last month, the Crown Prosecution Service, covering England and Wales, said it would review the decision. A senior prosecutor unconnected to the original case will review the decision. Justice Lowell Goddard - who is leading an independent inquiry into child sex abuse - has also said she would investigate claims against Lord Janner.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Satellite images show colonies moving their locations in years when the thin sea ice on which they habitually breed forms late or is absent. Scientists report the observations in the online journal Plos One. They reveal the birds travelling long distances to find alternative sites. These are further in towards the coast, up on the ice shelves - the thick slabs of glacier ice that jut out over the ocean. It is a surprise because these shelves are frequently faced with cliffs that may be tens of metres high in places. But somehow, the emperors find a way up to breed, and also to come and go as they forage for the seafood that will sustain their chicks. \"We thought that in years when the sea ice was bad, they just didn't breed, but they're clearly more adaptable than that,\" said lead author Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey. The emperor is the most southerly of the Antarctic penguin species and the only one to breed on sea ice in the southern winter. Their reliance on these thin seasonal marine floes as a reproductive platform, coupled with concern about how the patterns of Antarctic sea ice could change in a warming world, has led to the species being designated as \"near threatened\" on the IUCN red list. Currently, the extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing year by year, albeit slowly. The coverage does however vary considerably by region, and climate computer models indicate any gains will very likely be reversed later this century. But this study on four colonies around the continent suggests emperors do have the capacity to meet and beat some of the challenges that may lie ahead. In the observations of Shackleton Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, for example, the penguins are seen to be very adept at finding the routes that allow them to get past a 30m-high cliff. \"When they go out from the colony to forage, they go down the steep cliff - the shortest route to the sea. We're not sure how they get down - they may slide down or jump down,\" Mr Fretwell told BBC News. \"But this cliff is too steep for them to climb back up and so they must return a different way, likely through an ice creek. This route is 5km longer and we know they take it because we can see their tracks in the satellite pictures.\" There is a big opportunity here to go study these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition. There is obviously some cost to going up on the ice shelves - they are windier and the birds must travel further to forage. If that cost was not there, they would habitually breed on the shelves rather than the temperamental thin floes.  But how big this cost is and how beneficial is the observed adaptation in years of poor sea ice has yet to be properly established. Co-author Barbara Wienecke from the Australian Antarctic Division said: \"These new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals. However, we cannot assume that this behaviour is widespread in other penguin populations. \"The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment - from sea ice to ice shelf - in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected. \"We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Ancient cities around the shores of the Mediterranean and Adriatic are on the front line, their stone streets squeezed full of summer visitors as budget airlines and giant cruise ships unload ever-growing armies of tourists. Take the Croatian city of Dubrovnik: a perfectly preserved historical miniature, carved from honey-coloured stone set in a sea of postcard blue. Around 1,500 people live within the walls of its Old City, custodians of cultural treasures left by everyone from the Romans and the Ostrogoths to the Venetians and the Habsburgs. On a busy day three modern cruise ships, each one the size of a floating apartment building, can disgorge five or six times that number of people into the city. They join the throngs of tourists staying in local hotels and in rooms rented over the internet, in streets where almost every elegant stone house has been converted into a B&B. The overall effect is Disneylandish - a sense that you meet no-one but other tourists or ice-cream sellers, tour guides, waiters, reception clerks and buskers who are there to keep the tourist wheels turning. Mark Thomas, who edits The Dubrovnik Times, explains the phenomenon like this. \"When I first got here, I'd stand back if I saw that people were taking photographs of each other. Now there are so many people that I know if I did that, I'd never get anywhere here.\" Dubrovnik has a particular problem because its ancient appeal has now been bolstered by that most modern of phenomena - the HBO mini-series. The city, unchanged for centuries, provides the main locations for Game of Thrones. Fans come on pilgrimages to visit the settings. One souvenir shop owner, who told me he doesn't watch the series himself, admitted he had Googled a couple of catchphrases to help attract customers. \"It does seem crazy,\" he admitted, \"to stand here when it's 35 degrees, shouting that 'Winter is Coming'.\" Dubrovnik is not alone in struggling to balance its need for tourists' money with the need to ensure that those tourists don't end up destroying the beauty they've come to see. The tiny Italian island of Capri has warned that it could \"explode\" under the pressure of the trade that sees as many as 15,000 visitors a day travelling by boat from the mainland, to visit its once-idyllic streets and squares. One local official told The Daily Telegraph: \"You can't fit a litre-and-a-half into a litre pot.\" Florence, Barcelona and some Greek islands like Santorini have suffered too, and it was perhaps Venice which experienced the problem first. Its population has been falling since the 1950s, effectively forced out by the hordes of cruise-ship visitors. Tourism, of course, remains essentially a good thing and in the developed world we nearly all do it. It means trade and cultural exchange and it's both a symbol of rising prosperity and a generator of future wealth. Part of the \"problem\" is that travellers from traditional sources like the UK, Germany and the USA are increasingly being joined by the new middle classes of countries like Russia, China and India. Add to that the issue of security, which means that many tourists feel safer in Europe than they do in alternative destinations like Tunisia, Turkey or Egypt, and it's hard to see the numbers falling any time soon. It will fall to local governments in places like Dubrovnik and Capri and Venice to find a way of reducing those growing pressures. For now, ideas like installing turnstiles on ancient squares and pedestrian traffic lights on crowded streets may sound rather fanciful. But if that tourist tide keeps rising they might start to seem a little more tempting.",

Veterans for Justice UK expect about 100 former soldiers to take part in a march through the city next month. Organisers said it was to highlight \"injustices against soldiers\". Mr Kelly said the march by British Army veterans on 4 March \"must not be allowed to happen\". \"Clearly, this is an act of pure provocation and is totally insensitive to the nationalist population. It's a deliberate insult,\" he said. \"Its organisers should think carefully about the effect this could have on bereaved families here, families still reeling from the crimes of the past, not to mention the ordinary citizens of this city.\" Thirteen people were shot dead on 30 January 1972, and a 14th victim died later, after troops opened fire on a civil rights march. Speaking on behalf of the Bloody Sunday Trust, Minty Thompson said holding the march in Derry was a \"deliberately provocative act\". \"This city has clearly been chosen because it was the scene of one of the most horrific acts of state violence in our history, Bloody Sunday, and because soldiers who were involved in that event, who shot down innocent and unarmed people on our streets, are at long last being investigated for their actions,\" he said. The Northern Ireland branch of the Veterans for Justice UK group was established in December 2015. Anto Wickham, who is organising the Derry march, said their aims were to protect soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan facing \"false prosecutions\". \"If soldiers break the law then they face the rigours of the law and rightly so, and it's the same as it should be for any other member of the community,\" he said. \"But where's the investigation into my colleagues and friends who were murdered? It just seems to be forgotten about.\" The former Royal Irish Regiment soldier added the marches were planned in 2016 as part of a larger campaign to put pressure on the government. Mr Wickham said he was \"upset\" by suggestions the march was planned to raise tensions in the city. \"I understand the families and the victims are still really hurt and they want prosecutions. \"If that's the case, and there is evidence, then you have to face the rigours of the law but that should also be the same with the IRA.\" The prosecution of those involved in killings is a major stumbling block in efforts to deal with the legacy of Northern Ireland's Troubles.

But John Findlay, who was abused while a pupil in the care of Aberlour House in Moray, said money would be better spent supporting victims. He said the inquiry was \"yet another process\" rather than progress towards helping people. Mr Findlay told BBC Scotland's Timeline programme how he had spoken publically before about what happened to him, but has not been contacted about giving evidence to the inquiry. He was abused by one of his teachers, who is no longer alive, at Aberlour House, a prep school for Gordonstoun private school in Moray which Mr Findlay went on to attend. Mr Findlay was assaulted in his bed in a dormitory after being given what he described as a form of date rape drug. \"He fondled my genitalia. He put his head under the covers, He took photographs,\" said Mr Findlay of the attack. \"Once I was able to move afterwards I confronted him about it. I was convinced by him that I imagined it, that nothing happened.\" Mr Findlay said what happened to him as a child \"tainted\" his adult life, including work and personal relationships. On the inquiry, he said: \"I would love to say I have hope, however, it is yet another announcement of yet another inquiry and yet another process. \"I see actually no progression whatsoever with regards to any government or any school providing genuine help for victims of abuse. \"It is all very well saying 'yeah, we are looking into it', but for crying out loud it is about time you could just turn around and say instead of spending how ever much on inquiries why not just spend the money on helping the victims of this abuse.\" Gordonstoun is among boarding schools and other institutions involved in the investigation.

Gordonstoun said: \"We welcome the Scottish Abuse Inquiry's invitation to submit a report and will respond in full. \"Cases of non-recent abuse must be unimaginably distressing for the victims and their families and the work that the Scottish Abuse Inquiry is undertaking will, we hope, draw important lessons from the past and make children safer in the future. \"For everyone at Gordonstoun today, making sure our students are happy, healthy and safe is at the heart of everything we do. \"We are committed to providing a safe and nurturing environment for all our students. Our ongoing work in this area was recognised in our most recent independent Care Inspectorate Report which gave us a rating of five -  'very good' - for pupil care and support and noted the 'comprehensive child protection procedures' in place.\" The Scottish government said it had established one of the widest ranging public inquiries that Scotland has ever seen into the abuse of children in care. A spokesperson said: \"It will focus on the systemic institutional failures which saw many of our most vulnerable children, including those in the care of the state, abused by the very individuals who were there to care for them. \"We want that inquiry to be able to undertake its work in a timescale that can address the issues raised by survivors. \"Scotland is one of the few countries in the world that has dedicated funding for support services for adult survivors of child abuse. \"We have made real progress in delivering what survivors told us they wanted, including a greatly expanded support fund of Â£13.5m over five years to co-ordinate access to and deliver resources, integrated care and support for those who were abused in care.\" The spokesperson said Deputy First Minister John Swinney had also committed to a consultation on redress, pledging to work with survivors to consider the wide range of differing views on the subject. The spokesperson added: \"Last year, we introduced legislation to make it easier to take civil action against historic child abuse, and we also reviewing the child protection system to ensure it is as effective as it can be.\"",

He is the first of Wales' 17 dually contracted players to re-sign on the deals which are 60% funded by the WRU and 40% by the region.

His retirement comes after a report by Prof John Drew found the force's response to the abuse was \"inadequate\". It was commissioned after the Jay Report found 1,400 girls were abused in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. In a brief statement, South Yorkshire Police said: \"The chief constable's contract runs until November. He will retire after 31 years in policing.\" Prof Drew's report, which was published on Wednesday, said the force \"regularly missed\" opportunities to tackle the problem of abuse and had \"seriously under-resourced\" its early work. The report also said several attempts to alert senior officers to the issue fell on \"deaf ears\". The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) revealed it was looking into 200 allegations about the conduct of police relating to child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. It also said it had 55 ongoing investigations linked to at least 66 officers in South Yorkshire and had received more than 100 allegations linked to officers who have not yet been identified. In a statement, the IPCC said: \"From the moment the IPCC wrote to South Yorkshire Chief Constable David Crompton to advise him of our expectations for referrals following the publication of the Jay Report in August 2014, the number of allegations and number of officers involved has steadily increased. \"We first announced an investigation in November 2014 and that related to allegations raised in the Jay Report against 10 officers.\" Aside from the issue of abuse in Rotherham, Mr Crompton also faced criticism when Sir Cliff Richard's home was searched in connection with an inquiry into alleged child abuse in 2014. The force co-operated with the BBC to enable live TV coverage of the raid, which an independent report found had \"interfered with his [Sir Cliff's} privacy and may well have caused unnecessary distress\".

A total of 98 refugees have now arrived in Northern Ireland since the conflict. The first group of Syrian refugees arrived in December 2015.

    "document": "Under the proposals, 120,000 additional asylum seekers will be distributed among EU nations, with binding quotas. It comes after a surge of thousands of mainly Syrian migrants pushed north through Europe in recent days. Mr Juncker told the European Parliament it was \"not a time to take fright\". Germany, the main destination for many migrants, supports quotas, but some EU countries oppose a compulsory system. Mr Juncker's plans were set out in a \"state of the union\" annual address in which he outlined the priorities of the European Commission. He opened his speech by admitting the European Union was \"not in a good situation. There is a lack of Europe in this union, and a lack of union in this union\". He said tackling the crisis was \"a matter of humanity and human dignity. It is true that Europe cannot house all the misery in the world. But we have to put it into perspective. \"This still represents just 0.11% of the EU population. In Lebanon refugees represent 25% of the population.\" The mass migration has seen those seeking an end to persecution, conflict and hardship travel from Turkey across the sea to Greece, through Macedonia and Serbia, and then to Hungary from where they aim to reach Austria, Germany and Sweden. On Wednesday, Denmark suspended all rail links with Germany and shut a section of motorway after migrants crossed the border and began walking north, apparently trying to reach Sweden. In southern Hungary, migrants on the border with Serbia broke through police lines at the Roszke camp, forcing the closure of the M5 highway. Among Mr Juncker's proposals:. \"It's 160,000 refugees in total that Europeans have to take into their arms and I really hope that this time everyone will be on board - no rhetoric, action is what is needed,\" he told MEPs. The new plans would relocate 60% of those now in Italy, Greece and Hungary to Germany, France and Spain. The numbers allocated to each country would depend on GDP, population, unemployment rate and asylum applications already processed. Countries refusing to take in migrants could face financial penalties. 14 Sept: Special meeting of EU interior ministers on refugee crisis, with Juncker proposals on agenda. 15-16 Oct: EU leaders' summit, with refugee crisis high on agenda. European Parliament then to decide on any new asylum measures with EU governments. Early 2016: EU proposals for better management of legal migration to EU due. What next for Germany's asylum seekers? Peston: Why Germany needs migrants more than UK. What can the EU do to solve the crisis? Nine key moments in crisis. The other exodus to Germany - people from the Balkans. Migrant crisis in pictures. Are you affected by the crisis? Spain on Wednesday said it would accept a quota of almost 15,000 extra migrants migrants set by EU. However Mr Juncker's proposals was criticised by both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said compulsory quotas were \"not a good solution\", while his Slovak counterpart called them \"irrational\". Poland and Romania have also opposed the idea, although Poland has agreed to take in more migrants. France welcomed the first of 1,000 migrants it has pledged to take from Germany, having committed to receive 24,000 migrants over two years. In a separate development Australia has announced plans to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees. Germany has welcomed Syrian migrants, waiving EU rules and saying it expects to deal with 800,000 asylum seekers this year alone - though not all will qualify as refugees and some will be sent back. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that Germany needed to learn from its mistakes in labelling incomers in the post-war period as \"Gastarbeiter\" or \"guest workers\" - with the implication that they were not permanent residents. Many of the refugees it expects in future \"will become new citizens of our country\", she said. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",

Police allege that on 8 March after a news conference in Florida, he grabbed her arm when she tried to ask Mr Trump a question, leaving a bruise. Mr Lewandowski plans to plead not guilty, the Trump campaign said. Police in Jupiter, Florida, where he was arrested, have released new footage of the alleged assault. The security video appears to show him trying to pull Ms Fields out of the way as she walks alongside Mr Trump and tries to speak to him. \"Mr Lewandowksi is absolutely innocent of this charge,\" the Trump statement said. \"He is completely confident that he will be exonerated.\" Mr Trump himself has defended Mr Lewandowski on Twitter, saying the police footage shows there was \"nothing there\". If Donald Trump is going to win the Republican nomination without a convention fight, he will have to endure yet another string of political blows that would stagger even the strongest campaign. A week before a key primary in Wisconsin, Scott Walker - the state's governor - gave a full-throated endorsement of rival Ted Cruz. Now Mr Lewandowski has been charged over his manhandling of a female reporter during a rally. This comes after a particularly tawdry few days in the Republican presidential battle as Mr Trump and Mr Cruz engaged in a war of words over their spouses. The New York property developer has been able to maintain his front-runner status for months despite countless controversies and conflagrations. This time may be different, however. Recent events are likely to cause further damage to Mr Trump's already poor standing with female voters. The Republican presidential pack has been whittled to just three candidates, with the not-Trump vote consolidating behind Mr Cruz. Mr Trump's path to securing the Republican nomination is a narrow one, so the slightest stumble could deny him the prize outright. Then it's on to the convention, where party loyalists and a growing cadre of Cruz-friendly activists hold sway. The charge comes during a difficult time for Mr Trump, just ahead of next week's Wisconsin primary where he is neck-and-neck with Senator Ted Cruz. Earlier on Tuesday, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker endorsed Mr Cruz for president. Mr Trump will participate in a CNN town hall event on Tuesday night when all three Republican contenders will face questions. He is currently well ahead in the Republican race with 739 delegates to Cruz's 465. Ohio Governor John Kasich is some way behind with 143, with the 1,237 needed to win the nomination probably out of his reach. The 40-year hurt - how Bruce Springsteen articulated the forces that underpin the rise of Trump. Trumpisms - 22 things that Trump believes. Donald v George Bush - How extreme is Trump? A civil war - Lifelong Republicans turned off by Trump. Mr Cruz's campaign responded to the arrest by lamenting the \"abusive behaviour\" that they said seems to be part of the Trump campaign culture. That appeared to be an allusion to the. Around the time of the incident between Mr Lewandowski and Ms Fields, Mr Trump was on the defensive over violence committed by supporters against protesters at his rallies. In the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton will try in Wisconsin to stem the momentum of a resurgent Bernie Sanders, who is on a roll after a string of wins.",

This was also a fall from 5,400 in the same quarter last year. Lenders said low interest rates were keeping the numbers down but homeowners must prepare for a rate rise. \"This trend is very welcome. Low interest rates are acting as a significant support for homeowners in general, and are likely to be helping to stave off low level arrears for stretched households in particular,\" said CML director general Paul Smee. \"As ever, we urge borrowers to think ahead to when interest rates rise, and to contact their lender without delay if they are in difficulty. Prompt action helps to prevent problems worsening.\" Earlier this week, it was revealed that more than a million householders had never experienced a rise in the Bank of England's base rate while owning a home. Some 11.1 million mortgages are outstanding in the UK, with loans worth more than Â£1.3 trillion. The CML figures showed that 1,800 homes were repossessed from owner-occupiers, and 700 were seized from landlords in in the buy-to-let market in the second quarter of the year. The number of owners falling into arrears on mortgage repayments had also fallen in the second three months of the year compared with the first quarter, the CML said. Some 100,700 owner-occupiers, and 5,700 landlords, had arrears of more than 2.5% of the mortgage balance.

Sir Eric Pickles, a Eurosceptic who supports Mr Cameron's reform proposals, said action had to be taken to prevent a \"new influx\" of migrants. The ban has to be agreed by all EU nations at a summit on 18 February. It will be graduated, so that the longer migrant workers stay in the UK, the more in-work benefits, such as tax credits, they will be entitled to, in order to top-up their wages. EU referendum: PM faces grassroots anger over EU vote. Mr Cameron says the move will \"make a difference\" to high levels of immigration by reducing a \"pull factor\". But it will have to be agreed by member states, as part of a wider package of reforms to Britain's relationship with the EU, and will only apply for a temporary period as an \"emergency brake\". If Mr Cameron can get a deal on his reform package in two weeks' time at the Brussels summit he is expected to call a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU in June. David Davis, a former Tory leadership contender and leading Eurosceptic, said eastern European newspapers had carried numerous stories about the plan to terminate in-work benefits for the first four years after a migrant's arrival in the UK. At the same time, he said, Brussels has suggested the scheme could take 12 months to implement. \"Under such circumstances the incentive for anybody wishing to come to live in the UK will be to come as quickly as possible to beat the deadline when any such restrictions come into effect,\" he said. \"Accordingly we are likely to see a surge in migrants in the next 12 months.\" Mr Cameron has suggested the \"emergency brake\" could come into effect within three months of the UK applying for it. Eric Pickles defended Mr Cameron's reform deal, on the BBC's Sunday Politics, saying: \"What we need to be clear is, we're not trying to prevent people moving inside the European Union.\" The reforms were instead aimed at preventing people gaining \"something for nothing\" by claiming UK benefits before contributing anything in tax. But Sir Eric. a Conservative former cabinet minister, said action was needed to prevent a surge of migrants: \"Clearly as part of the negotiations we have to ensure that that doesn't happen.\" Meanwhile, speculation is continuing about whether a big cabinet name will lead the campaign to take Britain out of the EU. The Mail on Sunday said Boris Johnson, who has previously said Britain could prosper outside the EU and suggested Mr Cameron's deal needed more work, has told a fellow Tory MP he had \"never been an 'outer'\". Bernard Jenkin, a leading member of Vote Leave, told the newspaper: \"He is genuinely torn but I hope he will change his mind because he is one of the few who understands that if we stay in, Britain will be in a weaker position than ever before.\" Other potential Tory \"outers\" include Justice Secretary Michael Gove and Employment Minister Priti Patel, who have said they will make their position clear when they have seen the final deal. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who according to the Mail on Sunday has described the deal to friends as a \"load of rubbish\" which would be challenged in the European courts, is also refusing to comment publicly until the deal is finalised. UKIP MP Douglas Carswell told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it \"would be wonderful\" to have a Eurosceptic cabinet minister fronting the exit campaign but it would welcome anyone who wants to join it. He refused to enter into the war of words between the rival groups vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign, but ruled out a merger between them saying they had fundamental differences. He said Leave.EU, which is backed by UKIP donor Arron Banks, wanted to focus on \"identity and immigration,\" while Vote Leave, which he supports, wants to put forward an \"optimistic, upbeat internationalist message\". A third group, Grassroots Out (GO), which was founded by two Conservative MPs and is backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Mr Banks, has said it is exploring whether it has enough cross-party support to make a bid to be the official Leave campaign. One of its founders, Peter Bone, told the Sunday Politics there were 42 different Eurosceptic groups working together under the cross-party GO \"umbrella,\" and it was possible for them all to to operate as \"one happy family\".",

    "document": "The head of city centre regeneration is set to receive the largest increase of 20%, leading to a salary of £75,000. A council document said it reflected \"increased responsibility\" due to \"additional city centre development\". But, the Taxpayers' Alliance said people wanted to see lower council tax rates, not large pay rises for bosses. Councillor John Flanagan said the rises affected eight posts and would be funded \"from within existing budgets\". Seven other senior bosses could earn a pay rise of about 7%. Despite the disappointing performance of Manchester's schools over recent years, the strategic director of education and skills will get a pay rise of 7.6%. That will take their new salary to £125,000 per year. As for other council staff, there are around 1,300 employees who are paid the living wage of £8.25 per hour - and the average council salary is £23,000 a year. In addition to that, most city council employees were given a pay rise of just 1% earlier this year. The council have had to cope with huge cuts worth around £300m a year over the past six years. That has meant a reduction in staff from around 10,000 - to fewer than 6,000 today. Mr Flanagan, executive member for finance, said: \"It is essential that we can keep and attract the right calibre of senior staff by having salaries which reflect the levels of responsibility they have and are in line with those available in comparable cities. \"We are currently reviewing all staff salaries, from top to bottom, to ensure they fairly reflect their workloads and responsibility, while maintaining value for money for council taxpayers.\" Harry Davis, from the Taxpayers' Alliance, said the council had been \"really good over the last half decade\" over pay issues. \"They have removed about 400 staff earning over £50,000,\" he said. \"But, when savings need to be made and council tax is still going up, they have to make sure that they keep a tight grip on the purse strings so that they can channel as much as possible to front line services and tax cuts for local residents.\"",

    "document": "It comes after a dispute over whether Wales had the power to set minimum wages, or if that right laid with the UK government. UK Attorney General Dominic Grieve originally blocked a law passed by AMs last year, saying it was not within the assembly's powers. UK ministers said they were grateful for clarity on the issue. The dispute arose after the assembly passed a law last year to set minimum wages, and the terms and conditions, of agricultural workers in Wales after the UK government abolished the Agricultural Wages Board, which had regulated the sector. On Wednesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said the \"significant\" Supreme Court judgment \"goes some way to clarifying the complexities of the current devolution settlement\". The Welsh government said it could now create an Agricultural Advisory Panel to set minimum wage levels and \"promote skills development and career progression\" in farming. But the first minister warned \"we cannot continue to have bill after bill\" referred to the Supreme Court \"with all the time, cost and uncertainty that involves\". He called for Wales to move to a form of devolution where powers are assumed to rest with the assembly in cases like this, unless legislation specifically rules this out. Welsh Secretary David Jones said UK ministers were \"grateful to the Supreme Court for providing clarity on this issue\" and they would \"study the judgment in detail and consider its implications\". \"In its judgment, the court has favoured a broader interpretation of the provisions in the Government of Wales Act that govern the assembly's competence,\" he said. David Jones said UK ministers would \"continue to make every effort to ensure that the legislative arrangements for Welsh devolution work effectively.\" Assembly Shadow Rural Affairs Minister Russell George blamed \"rushed\" legislation for much of the confusion over the agricultural bill producing \"sloppy law-making, doubts over competence, and months of uncertainty for Welsh farmers\". Plaid Cymru agriculture spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said: \"The case for moving to a reserved powers model has been made and has been accepted by all parties in the assembly, and adopting this model would avoid these unnecessary delays.\" Liberal Democrat Eluned Parrott agreed Wales should move to a form of devolution more like the Scottish system that had received \"no legal challenges at all to Scottish legislation\" since 1999.",

They shouldn't be playing again.\" Fleming, 31, and his partner Jonathan Erlich, were beaten 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the first round of the Australian Open on Wednesday by Robin Haase and Fernando Verdasco. \"The key thing about sport is that it's pure, you don't know the outcome of any given match, and that's what people pay to come and watch,\" he added. \"You never know what's going to happen.

I'm surprised to see the article come out and talk about higher levels; I certainly haven't been aware of anything going on there.\" The Scot said he had no idea as to the identity of the suspected match-fixers, and suggested additional funding could be granted to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU), set-up to police the sport. \"Your guess is as good as mine,\" he said of those involved. \"There were no names in the article because it's very difficult to prove anything. I think that's the issue the TIU has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty. \"It can just be people throwing money on a match.\" Fleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in Melbourne. \"I think if you're sitting at home or buying a ticket to come and watch here at the Aussie Open, I've no doubt in my mind you're watching pure sporting theatre,\" he said. \"Players going at it and the best player winning on that day.

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Dame Margaret Hodge's review said it would be better to ditch the Garden Bridge than risk uncertain costs. Three months ago the Garden Bridge Trust admitted its future was in doubt after publishing accounts which showed a £70m shortfall in funding. Initially £60m of public money was pledged on planning for the bridge. Transport for London pledged £30m, but £20m of that was to be a loan, and the rest was from central government. Dame Margaret says £37.4m had already been spent, and even if the bridge did not go ahead it would cost the taxpayer £46.4m. The Garden Bridge Trust said it was seeking a meeting with the London mayor to discuss next steps, but added the trust was \"determined\" to make the bridge happen. Dame Margaret, the MP for Barking and Dagenham and former chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee was asked to examine the project by London Mayor, Sadiq Khan in September. On Friday, Dame Margaret said: \"Value for money for the taxpayer has not been secured. \"It would be better for the taxpayer to accept the financial loss of cancelling the project than to risk the potential uncertain additional costs to the public purse if the project proceeds.\" Dame Margaret said decisions on the Garden Bridge were driven more by electoral cycles than value for taxpayers' money. Her review also found costs spiralling out of control from an early estimate of £60m to over £200m now. Moreover, the review found the \"risk to the taxpayer has intensified\", while the original ambition to \"fund the Garden Bridge through private finance has been abandoned\". Other findings include:. Dame Margaret's review criticised the tendering process for the design of the Garden Bridge created by the previous City Hall administration. It stated architects the Heatherwick Studio were given a head start in the process having already been closely associated with the project for five months before invitations to tender were sent out. Two other firms that took part in the tendering process - Wilkinson Eyre and Marks Barfield - were given just eight working days to submit designs, the review said. David Marks, co-director of Marks Barfield, told the BBC: \"This competition didn't smell right from the start. It is clear that we were just there to make up the numbers and the outcome of this tender had in reality already been pre-determined. \"Had Marks Barfield been aware of Heatherwick Studios' involvement and original idea, we would certainly not have submitted a tender. \"We've never been asked to do something in such a short space of time.\" This is 40 pages of brutal, uncompromising criticism of nearly every part of the once flagship Garden Bridge project. I can't remember reading a report so damning of a transport project. Procurement, finances, business cases, value for money, previous mayors, deputy mayors and transport officials get an absolutely withering assessment. This was meant to be an oasis of green calm hanging above the Thames. Now a report has basically recommended it be cancelled and the taxpayer take a hit on a project whose overall cost is now upwards of £200m. It will be very difficult for the project to withstand this. The big question now is will the present Mayor Sadiq Khan just let it wither or kill it? Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Garden Bridge Trust, said: \"We will be studying the report in detail and seeking a meeting with the mayor to discuss next steps. \"The Trust remains as determined as ever to make the Garden Bridge happen which will bring huge benefits to London and the UK.\" A City Hall spokesman said: \"The Mayor has been absolutely clear that he will not spend any more of London taxpayers' funds on the Garden Bridge. \"It is the Garden Bridge Trust that remains responsible for raising the necessary funds, and delivering the project.\"",

    "document": "They include strong, stiff plastics and flexible gels that can mend themselves if torn. The findings, reported in the journal Science, could lead to cheaper and greener cars, planes and electronics. It is the first time that durable \"thermoset\" plastic has been produced in a recyclable form. Dr Jeanette Garcia, from IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, stumbled upon the first new class of thermosets in many years when she accidentally left one of three components out of a reaction. \"I had this chunk of plastic, and I had to figure out what it was,\" Dr Garcia told the BBC. \"I had to smash my round-bottomed flask with a hammer.\" That chunk of plastic, produced from unexpectedly simple ingredients, proved to be tremendously hard and stable. Crucially, it could be digested in acid, reverting to its original components. This digestion reaction allows the chemical building blocks, or monomers, to be reused. \"It was definitely fortuitous,\" Dr Garcia said. \"The first thing I did, of course, was to hit the literature, to try and see if it'd been done before. I just assumed that it had been - it's such a simple reaction.\" But her search turned up nothing. This was new. Once she understood what she had created, Dr Garcia set about repeating her finding. \"We wasted a lot of flasks,\" she said. Because they are strong and light-weight, thermosets are used throughout modern cars and aircraft, often mixed with carbon fibres to form composites. Some 50% of the new Airbus A350 jet, for example, will be made from composites. Yet until now, none of this thermoset plastic could be recycled. \"The potential impact here is phenomenal,\" said Dr Charl Faul, a materials chemist at the University of Bristol. He says the study offers a \"very simple, elegant answer to a very old problem\". Dr James Hedrick, who was in charge of the research at IBM, is excited by the possiblities. When a large or expensive component is damaged or reaches the end of its useful life, he explained, it could be repaired or recycled instead of thrown away. \"The ability to rework saves a tremendous amount of money and mitigates waste.\" Beyond replacing thermoset-based composites in current technology, Dr Hedrick sees the potential for many more innovative applications. \"We're at the discovery phase,\" he said. \"Every time you discover a new polymer-forming reaction it leads to all sorts of new materials.\" As well as very hard and durable plastics, the researchers adapted their procedure to a different monomer and produced flexible, self-healing gels. These could be useful in anything from cosmetics, to paint, to the design of drug capsules, because of their particular solubility properties. \"Applications are running like water,\" Dr Hedrick said. \"We don't even know where to go with this yet.\"",

The reconstructed image will go on show at the Biggar and Upper Clydesdale Museum, which opens on Tuesday. The reconstruction was produced by specialists from Dundee University's Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification (CAHID) who worked from detailed analysis of the skull. Caroline Erolin, lecturer in forensic and medical art at CAHID, said: \"Given its age, the skeleton of Thankerton Man was in excellent condition, which allowed us to get a strong impression of how he may have looked. \"Once we built the basic shape of his face we then looked at historical data to get a better idea of how a man would have looked at that time.

    "document": "Members were unable to reach a compromise after eight hours of talks. The committee had considered plans - backed by deputy Leader Tom Watson - to reinstate elections to the shadow cabinet. Since 2011, the party leader has selected his own top team. Mr Watson said the proposal could help Labour \"put the band back together\" for a possible early election. A proposal  to decide on the details of the plan ahead of Saturday's leadership election result was voted down, by 16 votes to 15. Mr Corbyn was among those to vote against it, but did agree to further talks with Mr Watson and other senior figures before the next NEC meeting this weekend, at the party's conference in Liverpool. Mr Watson said afterwards that it was a \"very positive meeting\". He added: \"We agreed 22 changes to our rules and guidance, all sorts of positive things I'm sure the media will be really interested in.\" Many MPs see elections as a way of constraining Mr Corbyn, should he be re-elected as leader, and ensuring a balance of opinion at Labour's top table. Supporters of Mr Corbyn say any plan should call for party members and activists to also have a say in any elections. The Labour leader has said there is a \"thirst for democracy\" in the party and he backs a \"widening of the franchise\". Mr Watson also called for Labour's leadership election rules to be changed to exclude registered supporters who pay a one-off fee to vote. He described their participation as \"unpopular\" and suggested a return to a franchise of party members, trade unionists and MPs. In last year's contest, 84% of the 105,598 registered supporters who paid Â£3 to vote backed Jeremy Corbyn. This time around, they were asked to pay Â£25 to take part. Despite the increased fee, 129,000 people are thought to have applied successfully for a one-off vote in the contest between Mr Corbyn and his challenger Owen Smith - the result of which will be announced on Saturday. Registered supporters were given a say in the choice of leader as a result of changes brought in by Ed Miliband, and approved by the party in 2013, designed to open up the process to a wider audience. Critics have said it allowed the leadership election to be hijacked by far-left groups with their own agenda - although Mr Corbyn easily won the most support among all groups - including party members, trade unionists and other affiliated supporters. Mr Watson, who himself was elected deputy leader last year using the same franchise, said the reforms had been \"rushed\" and \"unpopular\". He suggested a return to the previous system used to elect Mr Miliband and his predecessors - in which voting was limited to an electoral college of party members, trade unionists, affiliate supporters and elected representatives of the party. \"We created a new category of member - a registered supporter - that was pretty unpopular in all sections. We want to remove that and we want also want to enfranchise ordinary trade unionists in the process,\" he said. Mr Watson said he did not want the changes to be seen as a threat to Mr Corbyn and suggested they would only apply after he stood down, whenever that may be. But the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the move would be seen as an attempt to make it much harder for a left winger like Mr Corbyn to be elected.

Many of the cases involve allegations of security force collusion. At the time the ombudsman was Al Hutchinson. The critical report into his office was carried out by the then criminal justice inspector, Michael Maguire, who replaced Mr Hutchinson as police ombudsman in July 2012. The report said there had been a lowering of operational independence between the ombudsman and the police, and that investigations into historical events should be suspended. The criticism contributed to the early retirement of Mr Hutchinson. A follow-up inspection report published on Wednesday concluded that enough improvements have been made for historical investigations to resume. Dr Maguire said his previous role had given him an \"understanding of the issues that needed to be addressed\". \"The office has worked very hard over the last year to put some of those issues in a way which repositions the office to be able to recommence these investigations again,\" he said. \"I welcome the CJI (Criminal Justice Inspection) report because I think it's the first stage in rebuilding confidence in the office and the work that it does.\" He said work had been done to make improvements across a range of areas. \"We've recruited a significant number of new staff who have direct experience in major investigations, changed the ways we prioritise cases, introduced thorough investigative process which are subject to ongoing and systemic review and we've developed a consistent approach to communication for the families,\" he said. The ombudsman's office has been given Â£12m to complete more than 150 historical cases over the next six years. Dr Maguire admitted that the number of cases to examine was \"ambitious\". \"At the beginning of exercise we will be doing a lot of review work which collects investigative material,\" he said. \"Many of those cases, in some cases 20 or 30 complaints, can be clustered around a particular core issue and be dealt with on an ongoing basis. \"I think given those two reasons we're in a much better place to be able to look at these cases in a shorter time frame than has been before.\" However, the DUP's Paul Givan raised concerns about the re-opening of historical investigations. He said it had \"the potential to once again damage confidence in the ombudsman's office\". \"The DUP has consistently argued the police ombudsman should solely focus upon dealing with present day complaints into the PSNI and de-couple it from historical investigations which has marred this office in controversy from its inception,\" he said. \"As a result of this decision the ombudsman office will become the subject of intense political scrutiny and debate that will only serve to distract from the important oversight role it has for effectively dealing with modern day policing issues. \"",

Dylan Marcus Edwards, 50, from Llanrwst in Conwy county, admitted causing suffering to Cali the cat which was put in a bag and hit with a piece of wood. Llandudno Magistrates' Court heard the cat defecated in the Royal Oak Hotel kitchen in Betws-y-Coed in December. Edwards was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, suspended for two years. Tudur Owen, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said the cat had also bitten and scratched other members of staff. Colleagues had penned the cat under a fridge using chopping boards. Edwards and a colleague entered the kitchen saying \"we're going to have to kill the cat\" and came out with the animal inside a black bag, carrying a piece of wood and saying \"we'll have to put it out of its misery\". The court heard the pair were challenged by another colleague but Edwards was concerned the cat would return if they chased it away and said to her: \"We don't have a choice.\" There had been a furious local backlash following the cat's death and an online petition calling for those responsible to be prosecuted attracted more than 35,700 supporters. Melissa Griffiths, defending, said Edwards had been dismissed from his job after 32 years working at the hotel. \"He's been vilified since and has become a hermit in his own home, afraid to go out because of the strength of feeling against him,\" said Ms Griffiths. \"He's been verbally abused and refused service in his local village. He wrongly believed the cat was not a protected animal because it was feral.\" Edwards was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and pay Â£865 costs. The court also heard the case against another 36-year-old man had been dropped. Speaking after the case, RSPCA inspector Phil Lewis said: \"The cat was put in a black bag and hit with a piece of wood. To me it's a heinous act. This was premeditated, pre-planned.\"",

    "document": "Sports minister Vitaly Mutko claims the country has done everything asked of it to meet IAAF anti-doping standards after being suspended last November. Athletics' governing body says Russia has made \"considerable progress\" but there is \"significant work to be done\". Russia will find out in May if it can send athletes to the Olympic Games. Mutko told Reuters: \"You say we should elect new leadership for the athletics federation - OK, we've done that. \"You should not elect anyone to be the leader who has done this or that - OK, we did that. \"There are no criteria. What should Russian athletics do? Dance on the table? Sing a song?\" Media playback is not supported on this device. Mutko's comments came after a taskforce set up by the International Association of Athletics Federations revealed its findings at a meeting in Monaco on Friday. Russia's athletics federation was suspended by the sport's world governing body in November after being accused of \"state-sponsored\" doping. IAAF president Lord Coe revealed five other nations - Ethiopia, Morocco, Ukraine, Kenya and Belarus - are also under scrutiny. He told BBC Sport: \"We want to return trust to our sport, this is not just a Russian issue. We have to be on the front foot, we need to be proactive about these things. \"I'm here to be judged on how many athletes I can get from safe secure systems into free, fair and open competition. And that has to be the sole arbiter.\" On the five other nations that are having their doping systems closely monitored, he said: \"Ethiopia and Morocco, as a matter of urgency, both need to implement adequate and robust testing in and out of competition. \"Kenya, Ukraine and Belarus have been put on a monitoring list for 2016 to strengthen their anti-doping regimes and make sure their journey to compliance is completed by the end of the year. \"There are no immediate sanctions. It is just a wake-up call. Sanctions will only be considered if they don't comply with requirements.\" The double Olympic champion also confirmed that a final decision on whether a Russian athletics team would compete in Rio would be made at the next IAAF council meeting, which will be convened for that specific purpose in May. Russia was suspended following the publication of an independent World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) report that examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in its athletics. It must demonstrate it meets Wada and IAAF rules before being readmitted into the sport and, potentially, allowed to compete in the Rio Olympics. The suspended Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) must also be able to operate without interference, following claims the country's security services were involved in the doping programme. Rune Andersen, a former director of Wada, leads the five-strong IAAF taskforce which is examining Russia's anti-doping procedures. \"Russian authorities have made significant progress to meeting many of the verification criteria established by the IAAF, including changing president and council,\" Andersen said. \"The view of the taskforce is there is significant work still to be done to satisfy the reinstatement conditions - it's a big job and they're just at the beginning of this.\" In an open letter, Beckie Scott, chair of the committee that represents athletes at Wada, wrote: \"There needs to be further investigation into other sports in Russia, and other countries identified in the report. \"The response to date - to such an evidence-based, incriminating report - has been unsatisfactory, and we renew our call for Wada to extend the mandate of the independent commission to sports in Russia other than athletics, as well as other countries named in the report. \"Wada states clearly that it supports clean athletes and at the moment, clean athletes are disappointed with the lack of action that has been taken.\"",

    "document": "The 51-year-old London mayor has spent more than a decade combining the gravitas of his various roles with an unkempt, humorous persona rarely seen in modern public life. Prime Minister David Cameron expressed his delight when Mr Johnson announced his decision to run for parliament again in 2015, saying: \"I want my star players on the pitch.\" But now the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has said he will campaign against the PM in the EU referendum, relations between the two may become more tense. The big question is whether the blond-haired old Etonian wants simply to play for the team or to captain it. He has arguably the highest profile of any Conservative except Mr Cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister. When he beat Labour's Ken Livingstone to become London mayor in 2008 it was the Tories' first high-profile election success since before Tony Blair's triumphant entry into Downing Street in 1997. He defeated Mr Livingstone again in 2012, giving him even more of a winner's aura. The hoopla surrounding Mr Johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the Commons as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. He swept into the safe Conservative London seat in the 2015 general election, taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio. Given the opportunity to enter Downing Street on a fortnightly basis, cycle helmet in hand, was seen as recognition for his unique rapport with voters. But crucially he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility, giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign. Although lauded by Conservative activists for his witty speeches, Euroscepticism and lack of PR polish, Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free. In 2004 he had to make a visit to Liverpool to apologise for an article in the Spectator magazine, which he then edited. It had criticised the people of the city for their reaction to the death of Ken Bigley, the British contractor taken hostage and killed in Iraq. The following month he was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims he had an affair. He created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when he attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. He said he would like to \"get rid of [him] and tell people to eat what they like\". Later he provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as \"too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs\" and associating Papua New Guinea \"with orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing\". The London mayor's life has been as exotic as his use of language. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and he held US citizenship until 2006. Descended from Turkish, French and German stock he describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\". His great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, briefly served as an interior minister in the Ottoman Empire. The son of a diplomat and Conservative Member of the European Parliament, he was educated at Eton College, where he was senior to Mr Cameron. There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson's part at being overtaken by his younger rival. At Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre-left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant he moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, he then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as its Brussels correspondent and assistant editor. In his seven years as MP for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 he did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice-chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture. His decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign he made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as he beat Mr Livingstone by 54% to 47%. Days after his victory he banned alcohol consumption on public transport. A keen cyclist himself, he launched a central London bicycle hire scheme, known colloquially as \"Boris bikes\", and ditched the \"bendy bus\" in favour of a new generation of double-deckers. Although suffering a series of high-profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair's departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said he was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson. He was in charge when riots hit the capital in the summer of 2011. Initially criticised for taking too long to return from a holiday, he was later praised for his handling of events, including making tours of the affected areas. Mr Johnson also represented the city when it received its greatest publicity in decades, during the 2012 Olympics. His speeches were well received but he was a little embarrassed when, at one promotional event, he became caught on a zipwire, to the delight of photographers. In 2011 he told the BBC's Newsnight he did not expect to do \"another big job in politics\" after leaving the mayoralty. This was not universally accepted at face value. Mr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about his ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond his remit in London, in particular on Europe. His latest decision means that speculation is guaranteed to continue.",

The law, AFSPA, was introduced in the region in 1990 as a response to violence by insurgent groups. But it has contributed to increasing people's alienation, the report says. Tens of thousands of security forces are deployed in Indian-administered Kashmir to fight the militancy which began in the late 1980s. AFSPA - the Armed Forces Special Powers Act - allows troops to shoot to kill suspected militants or arrest them without a warrant. Amnesty says these sweeping powers have led to a cycle of impunity for human rights violations in the troubled region. The report says not a single member of the armed forces has been tried in a civilian court for violating human rights in Kashmir. \"This lack of accountability has in turn facilitated other serious abuses,\" says Minar Pimple, the group's senior director of global operations. \"By not addressing human rights violations committed by security force personnel in the name of national security, India has not only failed to uphold its international obligations, but has also failed its own constitution,\" she added.

    "document": "Files were found after the attacks on a computer dumped in a rubbish bin, a well-placed source confirmed. The computer also included a final message from one of the airport bombers, Ibrahim el-Bakraoui. Belgian authorities have identified all 32 victims who died on 22 March. Seventeen were Belgian, and the other 15 from around the world. Another 94 people are still in hospital, and dozens of them are in intensive care. The first funeral has taken place, for Raghavendran Ganeshan, whose body was returned to the Indian city of Chennai on Tuesday. The discovery of the computer emerged the day after the Brussels attacks. It had been abandoned in a bin in Max Roos street in the Brussels area of Schaerbeek. The three suspects captured on airport CCTV had left a house on the same street by taxi and the driver had later guided police to the address, where explosive materials were found. Quoting reliable sources, De Tijd newspaper said earlier that files on the computer contained details and photos of the prime minister's building and office at 16 Rue de la Loi (Wetstraat in Dutch) as well as details of his official residence in Lambermont street. It is unclear if these were downloaded from the internet or taken by the bombers themselves. A spokesman for Mr Michel said security had been strengthened well before the attacks last week because of concerns the buildings were vulnerable. The chancellery is also next door to the US embassy and on the same street as Maelbeek metro station, where Ibrahim el-Bakraoui's brother blew himself up little over an hour after the airport attack. The computer has become a vital source for Belgian investigators searching for the third airport suspect, who is thought to have fled the airport when his suitcase did not explode. In his final message on the computer Ibrahim el-Bakraoui complained of being hunted and not feeling safe anymore. Copies of laptop hard drives linked to suspects in the Brussels attacks have been sent to the FBI, according to reports from the US. Brussels airport remained closed for flights on Wednesday, after a test involving hundreds of staff. The airport operator said no flights were planned until at least Thursday afternoon as the results of the trial were still being assessed. A temporary check-in area has been installed along with enhanced security measures. But officials say they will only resume flights when they are able to operate at 20% capacity,. Chief executive Arnaud Feist has said it will take months to reopen fully, as the departures hall will have to be rebuilt \"from the air conditioning to the check-in desks\". Several airlines have diverted flights to Liege, Antwerp Ostend and Charleroi. However, Brussels Airlines is running only 40% of its flights and says it is losing €5m a day because of the closure of Brussels airport. In a separate development, an open letter written by police at the airport has been published by Belgian broadcaster VRT, in which they express frustration and say security was not taken seriously enough. They complain of a shortage of staff and say the airport's \"open infrastructure\" meant that trains, buses and cars were able to approach and leave the airport without any control.",

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blasé attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation. He is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web. To some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet. To others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted. Dingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues. But we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas. The timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (£0.7bn) a year in revenue. Dingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web. \"I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,\" he tells me, \"where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article. \"The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story.\" The Tor Project's website has a section called \"Abuse FAQ\". It is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes. When talking about this, Dingledine invokes the \"guns don't kill people\" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do. \"I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things. \"It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists.\" I guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online. \"I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,\" Dingledine insists. \"Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there.\" In layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track. There have been rumours that law enforcement has \"cracked\" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid. \"As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor]. \"Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect.\" Any major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing. \"Which is frustrating,\" Dingledine interjects, \"Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy.\" Tor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading \"Tor Stinks… but it could be worse\", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: \"We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time.\" Given this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties. He is confident that funding will continue. \"A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet.\" The reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in. In 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month. \"About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely,\" Dingledine says. \"Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing…. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase.\" The ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online. But given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing. \"I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries,\" he says. ___________.

    "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The secretary of state was, by all accounts, a member of the \"Remain Campaign\" lobbying against a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. So President Trump's \"Climate Brexit\" was a blow to him - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company he used to head supports the accord while the government he now represents does not. It was also a blow to the State Department, and to diplomacy. How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this, as on other issues, Tillerson kept a low profile. Twenty-four hours after the decision, the only comment he'd made was an aside at a photo-opportunity. He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things \"in perspective\". Tillerson had previously said the US should \"maintain its seat at the table\" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement. But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president's daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super-engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony. Mr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday-act-of-resistance, we don't know. A State Department official said only that he was in his office and \"maintained his schedule, preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand\". No doubt Pruitt (and his ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments. But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. He's already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department. And the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than he does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House. Clearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement. Where it once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, it's now been dropped off the map. The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement. Finally, it's a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck. \"We have now slapped every country in the world in the face,\" says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration. \"We've said we know this matters to you a lot, we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable, but we drop out. It's the worst way you could treat other countries.\" To be fair, this is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush's decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty. But it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what's going on. So while this will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends. Follow Barbara on Twitter.",

A total of 225 jobs are threatened at the Dalzell plate-rolling works in Motherwell, along with 45 posts at the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang. The company blames cheap Chinese imports and high energy costs for a collapse in steel prices. The Scottish government has assembled a taskforce to try to guarantee a future for the plants. Community union representative Derek Fearon said: \"We are trying to raise awareness of the campaign, and hopefully through this Tata will become a responsible seller. \"The main aim of the taskforce, the priority of it, is for the two plants to remain open. \"The mood is upbeat, the guys are still positive that everything can be done for the two plants to be saved.\" The Scottish government has pledged to do everything possible to keep the plants operational, with its preferred option being to find a buyer. However, ministers have not ruled out moves to bring both facilities under public ownership. A Scottish Steel Task Force, chaired by business minister Fergus Ewing, and including representatives from trade unions and Tata, as well as local councils, met last week to discuss the way forward. Motherwell and Wishaw MSP John Pentland, himself a former steelworker, has welcomed the creation of the task force and called for all avenues to be explored to keep the plants open. He said: \"The starting point for the Scottish Task Force should be saving the steel plants and all the jobs, not softening the blow. \"We should not meekly accept the annihilation of the Scottish steel industry. We don't want consolation measures such as retraining for other jobs that don't exist. There are other options that will protect the industry and its jobs. \"I believe Scottish steel can have a future, and we must consider all the options to achieve that, including public ownership, which doesn't rely on Westminster anymore.\"",

Haley McTaggart, 33, admitted getting her charity Alice's Escapes to pay Â£2,000 for her to go on a trek to Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. McTaggart admitted fraud and was jailed for 10 months suspended for two years. The court also heard how McTaggart sold raffle tickets for a false raffle and never handed over the money. She also told the charity that she was unable to transfer money after the trip to Tanzania. Sentencing McTaggart, Recorder John Corless said she had committed an \"unpleasant and serious\" offence. Alice's Escapes was founded in 2012 by Miss Payne who 16 at the time. The teenager wanted to provide holidays in Cumbria for seriously ill children and their families. The top item on her bucket list was the hope that everyone in the UK would sign up as a bone marrow donor, an aspiration which Prime Minister David Cameron praised in the House of Commons. It is estimated that about 40,000 people signed up as donors as a direct result of her appeal. Miss Pyne and her sister Milly raised more than Â£100,000.",

    "document": "The victim claims no-one responded when he brought the alleged offences to light. A complaint is being reviewed by the Church of England, his lawyer said. Clergy representatives said they were unable to comment on the claims published in the Guardian as they formed part of an active investigation. The priest said all five men were aware of his claims he had been repeatedly raped by a vicar when he was 16 in 1984, but none of them acted. He said he made the allegations verbally to the Right Reverend Peter Burrows, the Bishop of Doncaster; the Right Reverend Steven Croft, the former Bishop of Sheffield, and now Bishop of Oxford; and the Right Reverend Martyn Snow, a former Archdeacon of Sheffield and Rotherham, and now the Bishop of Leicester, between July 2012 and February 2013. The Archbishop of York John Sentamu and the Right Reverend Glyn Webster, the Bishop of Beverley, were also made aware when they were copied in to a letter sent to the Rt Rev Croft in June 2013, he said. His lawyer, David Greenwood, of Switalskis Solicitors, said the priest finally spoke up after a safeguarding issue in his own parish \"triggered his memories\". \"He reached out for help to the Bishop of Doncaster but found that he got no help, no support and no response,\" he said. \"He continued to try to elicit a response from the senior people in his diocese but got nothing.\" Under the Church of England's clergy disciplinary measures a complaint must be made within one year of the alleged misconduct. An application for permission to make complaints out of time has been lodged and is being considered by the church. Mr Greenwood said a complaint had also been made to West Yorkshire Police and the details of the alleged misconduct passed to the Goddard Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. A spokesperson for the archbishop said he had only been sent a copy of the letter and the original recipient of the letter had \"a duty to respond and not the archbishop\". A spokesperson for the bishops said that if the complaint went forward \"our bishops will make a full response to the various allegations made in due course\". A complaint has also been made by the priest against Roy Williamson, a former bishop of Bradford and now an honorary assistant bishop with the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham, that he failed to act at the time of the abuse. A spokesperson for his diocese said: \"We cannot comment during a live investigation except to say that if approached by the authorities we will offer them every co-operation.\" West Yorkshire Police said it is investigating a report of a historical serious sexual offence said to have occurred in the Bradford area in the 1980s. A force representative said: \"A crime has been recorded and a 69-year-old man has been spoken to in connection with the inquiry.\"",
