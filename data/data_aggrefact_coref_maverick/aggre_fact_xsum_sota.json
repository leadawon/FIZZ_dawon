The India captain, who won the toss for a fourth time, smashed a full - blooded sweep into Temba Bavuma at short - leg and after the ball ballooned into the air, wicketkeeper Dane Vilas dived forward to take the catch. That sparked a mini collapse with three wickets falling for three runs before Rahane, who hit two sixes and nine boundaries in Ajinkya Rahane first half century at home, steadied the innings and took India beyond 200. Rahane was helped by Jadeja, whose 59 - ball innings was ended by a smart Dean Elgar catch at midwicket off the bowling of Abbott.

The Karl G Jansky Very Large Array is based in the desert of New Mexico, close to the town of Socorro. As The Karl G Jansky Very Large Array name suggests, The Karl G Jansky Very Large Array is multi - antenna telescope.

The result is a wonderfully detailed impression of what is happening under the immediate surface of the many - banded weather systems that race across the top of planet' s atmosphere. The team looks at the glow of ammonia because the glow of ammonia is a tracer for the dynamical flow in the planet' s gases, which are dominated by hydrogen and helium. At Earth, you might do something similar by using water as the tracer.\" the scientists see the actual glow of the ammonia the ammonia itself, and the variation in depth is correlated with brightness,\" explained Dr Wong.\" The deepest the scientists can see in this dataset is about 12 Bar - 12 times the Earth' s atmospheric pressure.\" Plumes of ammonia are observed to rise up in waves. The team writes in the journal Science that the ammonia in these plumes will eventually condense out at higher altitudes, and could explain the ammonia ice clouds detected by the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s.\" All told, there is a wealth of information about the structure of Jupiter' s atmosphere in these new VLA images,\" said Imke de Pater, the lead author on the Science paper.\" We hope to resolve a number of outstanding questions with these new VLA images and future studies using similar techniques.\" Prof de Pater wants to try similar observations at the gas giants Saturn and Uranus.

The sum is the equivalent of BBC Four, CBBC and CBeebies, which would have to be taken off air, Mr Purnell said at an event to relaunch the iPlayer service. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the move should be discussed during talks to renew the BBC' s charter before 2017. Mr Purnell, who previously held the post in the Labour government, said\" it would be a huge risk to do the move now\".\" The choice would be: either the BBC ' s take those services off or the government would have to have a higher licence fee,\" Mr Purnell , who previously held the post in the Labour government said in reference to BBC Four - the arts and culture channel - and the BBC' s children' s stations. Mr Purnell , who previously held the post in the Labour government argued decriminalisation would inevitably lead to greater non - payment of the TV licence, which would force an increase in the fee. the licence fee is currently £ 145. 50 and has been frozen at that annual amount since 2010. the licence fee is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device. In 2012 about 155, 000 people were convicted and fined for not paying the licence fee, while there were some 180, 000 prosecutions. Mr Purnell added downgrading licence fee evasion to a civil offence would penalise the poor.\" Either you have a low penalty - in which case the evasion rates would go up and everyone would have to pay a higher licence fee - or a penalty which is higher and more difficult to pay,\" Mr Purnell , who previously held the post in the Labour government said. The BBC has previously said\" legislation is a matter for the government\".\" Just a 1 % increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around £ 35m, the equivalent of around 10 BBC local radio stations,\" the BBC ' s added. The government has floated the idea to ease pressure on the courts system. But the idea will not be discussed before charter renewal talks - which determine how the BBC is funded what the BBC ' s does and how the BBC ' s is managed. The current BBC charter runs out in 2016. Meanwhile, Labour MP John McDonnell has tabled an Early Day Motion in parliament calling on the BBC to reverse the BBC ' s decision to close BBC Three as a television channel. The motion stated BBC Three has been the home of programmes including Gavin and Stacey, and raised fears changes could lead to compulsory redundancies. an Early Day Motion added the BBC should receive a licence fee increase that tracks inflation when the corporation' s charter is renewed next year.",

The rise followed US data showing that oil inventories had fallen after supply disruptions due to fires in Canada. Brent crude has now risen 80 % since Brent crude hit 13 - year lows of below $ 28 a barrel at the start of the year. US crude oil inventories fell by 4. 2 million barrels to 537. 1 million barrels in the week to May 20, according to US Department of Energy data. Canada is the biggest supplier to the US and wildfires in the western provinces have reduced supplies by about a million barrels per day. Talks in recent months between Opec and Russia about freezing oil production had already encouraged a price rise. Short - term disruptions to oil supplies have also lifted the price, offsetting higher production from Iran and Saudi Arabia. As well as the disruption to key oil production facilities in Canada, attacks by militant groups continue to restrict oil pipelines in Nigeria. Demand has also been better than expected from major economies such as China, India and Russia. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said:\" We do now appear to be seeing the effects that the decline in US output is having, and while supplies remain elevated, the glut does now appear to be diminishing.\" Against this backdrop, analysts are starting to raise analysts forecasts. Goldman Sachs said earlier this month that Goldman Sachs now expected oil prices to consistently hit $ 50 a barrel in the second half of 2016 and $ 60 by the end of 2017. The US bank said:\" The oil market continues to deliver the oil market share of surprises, with low prices driving disruptions in Nigeria, higher output in Iran and better demand.\" With each of these shifts significant in magnitude, the oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected.\" In a sign of growing confidence, oil companies have started preparing for higher prices. BP said last month BP had budgeted for prices of at least between $ 50 and $ 55 a barrel in 2017. And last month US oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources announced plans to add up to 10 new rigs when the oil price gets back up to $ 50. Adam Laird, an investment manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, told the BBC:\" This is an area that' s been starved of resources and investment and that psychological barrier [ of $ 50] could be enough to make some executives reassess.\" However, Mr Laird cautioned that price volatility was likely to continue. \" It' s too early to say this is the beginning of the big rebound,\" he said.

It is expected the officials would mainly check the passports of travellers arriving from the European Economic Area and man so - called\" e - gates\" where passengers use passengers biometric passports. A UKBA spokesman said:\" The security of the UK border remains our top priority and it is absolutely right The UK Border Agency explore all options to ensure The UK Border Agency minimise any disruption caused by planned union action.\" However, union chiefs expressed concern that the officials might not be properly trained and that borders could be put at risk. Mr Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, blamed ministers for leaving it so late to try and resolve the dispute. Mr Serwotka , general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union told BBC Radio 4' s Today programme that the call to civil servants was an example of\" blind panic\" at the 11th hour, Mr Serwotka , general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union said, and accused the government of engaging in a misleading\" PR exercise\" about public sector pensions to try to force through\" damaging\" changes.\" Instead of scratching around trying to put untrained people on the front line, ministers should say today ministers want urgent talks to try to resolve the dispute,\" Mr Serwotka , general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union said. The government has confirmed earlier reports that UKBA is planning to fly some officials home from overseas positions to help deal with the strike. In the wake of the recent row between Home Secretary Theresa May and former UK border force chief Brodie Clark over the relaxation of controls during the summer, it is extremely unlikely that officials would be prepared to bypass any rules to ease the pressure of queues. The BBC has also learned that the government has told union bosses that the government are not prepared to offer any further concessions over pension reforms as a result of the planned strikes. The government recently made what the government describes as an improved offer to the unions, promising that public sector workers ten years away from retirement would not see any change to public sector workers ten years away from retirement pensions. the government also promised improved accrual rates. Ministers fear that any further concessions would send the wrong signal to financial markets by suggesting that the government was not serious about cutting the deficit and making substantial savings in the public sector pension bill. Ministers argue that public sector pensions have become unaffordable because of rising life expectancy, but Ministers insist that even after the planned changes, state employees will still be better off than the majority of workers in the private sector. Unions say Unions members are being asked to work longer, contribute more and receive less.",

The appointment breaks an HSBC tradition of appointing insiders to the chairmanship. One of Mr Tucker first jobs will be to find a replacement for Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, who plans to step down next year. While HSBC is Europe' s biggest bank, the bulk of HSBC profits are generated in Asia. Mr Tucker has been chief executive of AIA for seven years, during which Mr Tucker oversaw the insurer' s expansion in Asia. Before AIA, Mr Tucker was the chief executive of insurance giant Prudential, and brings to HSBC Mr Tucker experience at the top of a UK financial giant as well as Mr Tucker Asian exposure. Richard Dunbar of Aberdeen Asset Management, told the BBC the bank has\" obviously decided\" that an external perspective would be useful to HSBC at this time. Richard Dunbar of Aberdeen Asset Management added that while chief executive of Prudential, Mr Tucker did a good job of expanding insurance giant Prudential Asian assets, which are seen as the firm' s\" jewel in the crown\". HSBC has been through an overhaul in recent years in an attempt to reverse declining profits. Over the past six years HSBC has cut more than 40, 000 jobs and sold off businesses. Despite those efforts, profits tumbled more than 60 % last year. The banking industry has been hampered by the extended period of very low interest rates, which makes lending money less profitable. For HSBC, that problem has been compounded by HSBC move into less risky areas of banking since the financial crisis which started in 2007. Those challenges make the appointment of a new chief executive even more crucial for investors, a search which will now be led by Mr Tucker.

Here, BBC London' s home affairs correspondent Nick Beake answers the most popular. Why don' t the unarmed police officers at Westminster have protective body gear, stab - or bulletproof vests? And do the unarmed police officers at Westminster carry Tasers? Nick Beake: PC Keith Palmer was an unarmed officer protecting the Palace of Westminster, but Scotland Yard says PC Keith Palmer was wearing a protective vest at the time of the attack. The force said during the post - mortem examination\" the pathologist could find no obvious evidence of damage or penetration other than the vest having been cut off during emergency first aid at the scene\". Armed officers working at Parliament carry a primary weapon, a sidearm and a Taser. And an unspecified number of armed response vehicles - three firearms specialists in an unmarked car - are on constant patrol in central London. Will the pavement safety barriers removed from nearby London Bridge be restored? Nick Beake: The use of safety barriers varies from location to location. The police, local authorities and transport bosses will all discuss where to install extra measures to protect the public. The mayor of London' s office says The mayor of London ' s office is currently considering where more barriers could be installed. Why not build a 6in [ 15cm] concrete barrier on the bridge pavements to protect pedestrians from the traffic? Nick Beake: An independent review commissioned by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, last year recommended that more bollards be installed in busy parts of London to protect pedestrians from a Nice - or Berlin - style attack, where lorries were driven into crowds. The report author, Lord Harris of Haringey, also called on the authorities to make more use of temporary barriers during big public events. What is the correct immediate response for members of the public caught up in this sort of attack? Nick Beake: The current terrorist threat is rated as\" severe\", which means an attack is highly likely. The latest advice from the government is to run away from the danger, hide if run is not possible, and then tell the authorities:\" Run, hide, tell.\" More information can be found on the gov. uk website. What should we do if we see something suspicious? Nick Beake: If you spot something suspicious, ring the anti - terror hotline on 0800 789 321. And call 999 if you think there is an immediate threat. How do we know if something that seems suspicious is actually terrorism - related? Nick Beake: It can be hard for experienced police and other investigators to establish quickly if a threat is terrorist - related, but the authorities would rather the public contact the authorities with the public genuine concerns however small their genuine concerns may be.

One report said the blast was so strong that houses in a village several hundred metres away were hit by debris and some residents were slightly injured.

Mr Fillon said last week Mr Fillon , 62 was\" outraged by the contempt and misogyny\" in the newspaper' s story.

        "document": "Greek officials had been expected to meet representatives of EU creditors in the Greek capital Athens on Friday. But a European Commission spokeswoman later said those representatives would arrive\" in the coming days\". Separately, Greece formally submitted a request for a new loan from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF). In a letter to IMF head Christine Lagarde dated 23 July but released to the public on Friday, Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos wrote that Athens was\" seeking a new loan\". Greece had initially planned not to ask the IMF for more funds, reports say. Greek MPs have approved tough new conditions set by the EU lenders for talks on the bailout. It is unclear when IMF officials will be joining the negotiations. The Washington - based IMF wants Greece' s debt burden to be reduced to a level the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) considers\" sustainable\", but the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) faces resistance from reluctant European partners. EU officials said on Friday that there were\" logistical issues to solve\" before high - level talks with Athens could begin, but that negotiations were taking place at a technical level. The Greek team had been expected to meet top representatives from the European Commission, European Central Bank ( ECB) and European Stability Mechanism ( ESM) - the eurozone' s main bailout fund. Talks on the bailout package are expected to last a month. Tight capital controls, introduced at the end of June, remain in place to prevent a run on Greece' s cash - strapped banks. PM Tsipras faced a backlash from MPs in PM Tsipras own left - wing Syriza party, during two parliamentary votes on austerity measures required by the creditors in order for negotiations to start. But PM Tsipras secured parliament' s backing after a second crucial vote passed early on Thursday. The reforms debated this week included changes to Greek banking and an overhaul of the judiciary. Last week, Greece passed an initial set of austerity measures, including tax rises and pushing back the retirement age. Mr Tsipras has said that PM Tsipras is not happy with the measures imposed by creditors but that PM Tsipras government was forced to choose a\" difficult compromise\" to avoid Greece exiting the eurozone. A decision on more contentious measures - phasing out early retirement and tax rises for farmers - has been pushed back to August. Demonstrations have taken place on the streets of Athens against the bailout deal and trade unions have taken strike action. On Wednesday, the ECB increased European Central Bank ( ECB ) cash lifeline to Greek banks by € 900m - the second rise in a week. The IMF confirmed on Monday that Greece had cleared Greece ' s overdue debt repayments of € 2. 05bn and was no longer in arrears. The repayments, which included € 4. 2bn to the ECB, were made possible by a short - term EU loan of € 7. 16bn. Greece' s next major deadline is 20 August, when Greece ' s must pay € 3. 2bn owed to the ECB, followed by a payment of € 1. 5bn to the IMF in September.",

About 255, 230 pupils are registered for free school meals in Scotland. The government said the state was\" taking steps\" to measure food insecurity. Mr Adamson paid tribute to charities such as the Trussell Trust, which has begun a pilot project in Glasgow to offer cookery lessons to parents struggling to make ends meet during the holidays. Mr Adamson told the BBC' s Good Morning Scotland programme:\" There shouldn' t be stigma attached to having basic rights to food.\" The obligation is on the state to make sure that every child in Scotland is getting access to the food, the education, the healthcare, everything that every child in Scotland need. And access to the food , the education , the healthcare , everything that they need shouldn' t be a problem in the holidays.\" The more support the state can provide to the Trussell Trust and to all of the different programmes right across Scotland at community level that are delivering these important rights for children, the better.\" Mr Adamson added:\" It is a particular challenge over the holidays, which should be a time of joy and excitement and fun, but actually the holidays , which should be a time of joy and excitement and fun is the most challenging time of the year for many families in Scotland facing poverty.\" The Scottish government introduced free school meals for all children in primary 1 - 3 in 2015. Since then, more than 77 % of the 173, 000 five to seven - year - olds that are registered take up the option of a free meal at school. However, the numbers registered falls significantly for subsequent age groups, with only 39, 215 registered in P4 - 7 and 38, 841 secondary school pupils entitled to a free meal during term time. A Scottish government spokeswoman said that no child should be going hungry and that tackling inequality was a key government priority. A Scottish government spokeswoman added:\" Local authorities have the flexibility to provide meals to children outwith term time and some chose to use this flexibility during school holidays by providing holiday lunch clubs.\" In addition, the state have already invested over Â £ 350m in welfare mitigation measures, in addition to our Â £ 1m Fair Food Fund, which supports projects that promote dignity and harness the social potential of food to connect people and develop sustainable solutions to food poverty.\" A Scottish government spokeswoman acknowledged that more work was needed to measure the numbers of children thought to be going hungry. A Scottish government spokeswoman said:\" The Scottish government has therefore taken steps to better measure the full range of food insecurity in Scotland.\" Three questions on food insecurity in Scotland will be included in the Scottish Health Survey 2017. Thereafter, the full United Nations food insecurity question set will be included in the SHS from 2018 onwards.\" included will allow internationally comparable baseline data on food insecurity in Scotland to be available in 2019 with further data sets available annually thereafter.\"",

The decision by Mr Grindeanu own party and His left - wing Social Democrat party ( PSD ) liberal ALDE allies to oust Mr Grindeanu was seen as a first, even for Romania' s turbulent politics.

For many years, scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute had been researching a stem - cell - based therapy for cancer, which would kill only tumour cells and no others. scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute used genetic engineering to make stem cells that spewed out cancer - killing toxins, but, crucially, were also able to resist the effects of the poison the stem cells were producing. the stem cells also posed no risk to normal, healthy cells. In animal tests, the stem cells were surrounded in gel and placed at the site of the brain tumour after the brain tumour had been removed.

In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said:\" The United States is suspending The United States participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities.\" Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to Russia own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed.\" Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" Mr Kirby said, admitting that\" this decision by Washington is not a decision that was taken lightly\". state department spokesman john Kirby said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al - Assad' s troops had been\" targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of Russia own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said:\" Russia regret this decision by Washington.\"\" Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo.\" After failing to fulfil the agreements that The United States The United States worked out, The United States are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,\" Ms Zakharova said. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co - ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that The United States would withdraw personnel\" that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint ( US - Russian) Implementation Centre\". However, the two sides would keep talking about counter - terrorism operations in Syria to avoid unnecessary clashes.",

Caulfield was dismissed after getting a second yellow card while McGinnity saw red after appearing to strike impressive Kilcoo full - back Darragh O ' Hanlon. The Monaghan champions, beaten by Crossmaglen after extra - time in last year' s provincial final, only had points from Darren Hughes and Donal Morgan to show for The Monaghan champions , beaten by Crossmaglen after extra - time in last year ' s provincial final early domination as several other good chances were missed. Kilcoo hit back with five unanswered points after Aaron Branigan opened up Kilcoo ' s account in the ninth minute. Conor Laverty' s typically busy display was crucial to Kilcoo' s improvement as Donal Kane, Paul Devlin ( two) and Martin Devlin also notched points. After being held scoreless for almost 20 minutes, Scotstown found The Monaghan champions , beaten by Crossmaglen after extra - time in last year ' s provincial final range again late in the first half as the lively Shane Carey pointed a free and keeper Rory Beggan also hit the target from a 45 after missing three earlier long - range efforts. Aidan Branigan' s departure at half - time looked a blow for Kilcoo but instead Aidan Branigan ' s replacement Johnston went on to become the central personality in the match. The sides were level at 0 - 6 a piece when Johnston held his replacement Johnston nerve to produce a great finish past Beggan after Laverty had flicked on a long ball. After Shane Carey' s reply, Johnston looked to have palmed in a second Kilcoo goal but the effort was ruled out - harshly it appeared - for a square ball. The controversial decision looked as though ruled could be match - turning as another Carey point cut Kilcoo' s lead to the minimum but crucially Beggan and Carey then missed chances to get Scotstown on terms. Paul Devlin' s superb long - range point and an Aaron Morgan score, after more great work by Laverty, left Kilcoo three ahead with three minutes of normal time left and Carey' s seventh point was all Scotstown could summon in the remaining eight minutes of action.

Delegates at the Alzheimer' s Research UK Conference heard that the University of Nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics. the test could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments, Delegates at the Alzheimer ' s Research UK Conference said. The test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with Alzheimer' s disease, such as amyloid and APOE. But through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease, as well as those with early - stage memory problems, the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease. Most notably, some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test. Prof Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham said the researchers still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before the test was used in patients. But Prof Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham added that the combination of markers the researchers had found was looking very promising.\" Our findings are exciting because these findings show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with Alzheimer' s using a blood test.\" As blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis, the researchers are really encouraged by these findings and the potential these findings hold for the future.\" Prof Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham said there were several ways the test could benefit patients, including giving people a definitive diagnosis, which was not always possible at the moment. the test could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment, Prof Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham explained.

        "document": "A\" terrorist hide\" was uncovered at Capanagh Forest near Larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on Saturday. Some of the items found included an armour - piercing improvised rocket and two anti - personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become\" a strong possibility\". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI' s home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains\" severe\" and an attack is\" highly likely\". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a\" substantial number of explosive devices\". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant\" both in terms of the seizure size and the seizure capability\".\" A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,\" Det Supt Kevin Geddes added.\" This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives.\" Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus police investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries.\" There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,\" Det Supt Geddes said. Det Supt Kevin Geddes added that police are\" indebted\" to the two people who noticed the suspicious objects in the Capanagh Forest.",

A government statement said the strike violated Pakistan' s sovereignty.\" Pakistan has repeatedly emphasised the importance of bringing an immediate end to drone strikes,\" a foreign ministry spokesman said.\" drone strikes are counter - productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives and have human rights and humanitarian implications.\" In a separate development, at least six security personnel are reported to have been killed and at least six more injured in an early morning attack by militants at a checkpoint near Peshawar. At least two more are reported to be missing, possibly kidnapped by the attackers. Reports citing local officials said most of those killed in the drone strike were thought to be from the militant Haqqani group. Officials say four missiles were fired by a US drone, targeting two houses and two vehicles, near Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan. A number of other people were also injured. The Haqqani network has been described by US military commanders as one of the most resilient militant groups operating in Afghanistan. The troubled border region is a known stronghold for al - Qaeda and Taliban militants. Seven people were killed in a similar strike on 8 June, also in North Waziristan, just three days after the new prime minister was sworn in. After that incident the Pakistani government summoned a senior US diplomat in protest, condemning what Pakistan ' s called a\" violation of Pakistan' s sovereignty and territorial integrity\". At least two key leaders of the Pakistani Taliban have been killed in earlier US drone strikes this year. Mullah Nazir was killed in January and Waliur Rehman was killed in May, shortly after Mr Sharif swept to election victory. The BBC' s Richard Galpin in Islamabad says that the latest air strike by US forces will further heighten tensions between Washington and the new Pakistani government. Mr Sharif has called for a joint strategy to stop US drone strikes. The issue is hugely controversial in Pakistan, where parts of the government and military have often been accused of criticising the use of drones in public, but co - operating in private. Drone strikes are a source of severe tension between the US and Pakistan. It is estimated that between 2004 and 2013, CIA drone attacks in Pakistan killed up to 3, 460 people. About 890 of up to 3 , 460 people were civilians and the vast majority of strikes were carried out by the Obama administration, research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism said. Earlier this year, Mr Obama called the strikes part of a legitimate campaign against terrorism, but Mr Obama also pledged more programme transparency and stricter targeting rules.",

The vote came a day after the Senate rejected a plan to repeal and replace the health law with a Republican plan. Senators will now consider a\" skinny\" repeal, which would scale back some of the more controversial provisions. The\" skinny\" plan would eliminate unpopular parts of Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act - including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage as well as a tax on medical devices. If that measure passes, the Senate and House of Representatives would then be tasked with finalising a bill that could still change during negotiations. If successful, the full House and Senate would again have to approve the measure. Seven Republicans opposed the repeal - only plan on Wednesday, which included a two - year delay on a replacement in the hope of finding agreement before that time elapses. The defeat is the latest blow for President Donald Trump, who put repealing Obamacare at the centre of President Donald Trump , who put repealing Obamacare at the centre of his election campaign election campaign, and underscores sharp divisions within the Republican Party over a replacement plan. A proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare with the Better Care Reconciliation Act ( BCRA), a Republican plan that was crafted over last two months, collapsed on Tuesday night after nine Republicans voted against A proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare with the Better Care Reconciliation Act ( BCRA ) , a Republican plan that was crafted over last two months. Republicans have long railed against Obamacare as government overreach, criticising the system for introducing government - run marketplaces, where premiums have risen sharply for some people. The party' s proposed alternative included steep cuts to Medicaid, a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled. And the Better Care Reconciliation Act ( BCRA ) , a Republican plan that was crafted over last two months removes Obamacare' s individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. About 20 million people gained health insurance under former President Obama' s Affordable Care Act. The non - partisan Congressional Budgetary Office ( CBO) found the bill would strip 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade. Other attempts to replace Obamacare have failed in recent weeks due to Republican divisions. In an early morning tweet on Wednesday, Mr Trump lambasted Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska for opposing the party' s plan, saying Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\" really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad!\" Mrs Murkowski was one of two Republicans earlier on Tuesday to vote against allowing the debate on healthcare legislation reform to go forward. But Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska party eked out a victory after Vice President Mike Pence cast the tie - breaking vote which allowed discussion to take place.

Last year' s figure of confirmed cases for Wales stood at 116, while there were just 19 in 2011 and eight the year before, according to Public Health Wales. There were 159 cases in 2009, still lower than the current outbreak in south west Wales. Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales ( PHW), said:\" Public Health Wales continue to be concerned at the number of cases of measles Public Health Wales are seeing in the Swansea and Neath Port Talbot areas.\" Public Health Wales cannot emphasise enough that measles is an illness that can kill, or leave patients with permanent complications including severe brain damage, and the only protection is two doses of the MMR vaccination.\" Dr Marion Lyons , director of health protection for Public Health Wales ( PHW ) added that people most at risk of catching measles are children of school age who have not had two doses of MMR. Children should receive the first dose of the vaccine at 12 to 13 months of age and the second at three years and four months of age PHW estimates there are more than 8, 500 school children at risk of measles in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg area. Many people who catch measles will have a fever, cough, red eyes, and blocked nose and feel generally unwell. The blotchy rash appears a few days later beginning on the face and spreading downwards to the rest of the body over several days.",

Already known for vitriolic language, the KCNA report threatened to turn the South' s presidential residence, known as the Blue House, into a\" sea of flames and ashes\".\" Artillery shells flew like lightning and intensely and fiercely struck targets simulating Cheong Wa Dae and rebel governing bodies in Seoul,\" the KCNA report said of the latest drill, using the Korean name for the Blue House. It was not clear when the drill was carried out, but the report warned of a\" miserable end\" for President Park. The Blue House was attacked by North Korean commandos in 1968. The attempt to assassinate then - President Park Chung - hee was unsuccessful, but seven South Koreans and most of the 31 North Koreans attackers were killed.",

The young people went missing a number of times over a 20 - month period while being looked after in the care system. The Police Service of Northern Ireland ( PSNI) said The Police Service of Northern Ireland ( PSNI ) has recently made policy changes aimed at keeping children safe. In September 2013, the PSNI said The Police Service of Northern Ireland ( PSNI ) had begun a major investigation into the sexual exploitation of children and young people who had gone missing from care in Northern Ireland. Officers said Officers had identified 22 people, aged between 13 and 18, who may have been sexually exploited. The PSNI investigation was known was Operation Owl. Thursday' s report, examining the PSNI response, has been published by the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland. The review into 22 abuse cases in Northern Ireland said PSNI officers were effective in locating the teenagers and returning the teenagers to the care system. However, The review into 22 abuse cases in Northern Ireland found that PSNI officers failed to properly examine the extent of the child sexual exploitation taking place and PSNI officers attempts to find and stop the abusers was - in the words of the review -\" limited and inconsistent\". While there is praise for the help offered by some staff from residential care homes, Stormont' s Health Minister Simon Hamilton said that the report shows not enough support was given to protect the teenagers from harm or the risk of harm. Stormont ' s Health Minister Simon Hamilton said the review had identified\" a significant gap\" in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. The head of the PSNI' s Public Protection Branch, Det Ch Supt George Clarke said that following Operation Owl, the PSNI has\" implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure The Police Service of Northern Ireland ( PSNI ) are doing everything The Police Service of Northern Ireland ( PSNI ) can to keep children and young people safe\".\" Indeed, in April of this year, the PSNI formed the Public Protection Branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation.\" The new structures enable The Police Service of Northern Ireland ( PSNI ) to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more cohesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguarding for children and young people.\" The office said the PSNI has also revised The Police Service of Northern Ireland ( PSNI ) Missing Persons Protocol, a joint policy with the health and social care authorities.\" This protocol is designed to support effective collaborative safeguarding responses by the PSNI and social services in respect of children who run away or go missing from children who run away or go missing from their homes or care placements homes or care placements and builds upon developments in our knowledge and experience,\" Mr Clarke added. Last year, a separate review into the issue concluded that sexual exploitation was a growing threat to young people in Northern Ireland. That report also said that some abusers were thought to have links to paramilitary groups.",

Judge Carlos Castro Martins also said that any work would have to comply with the regulations laid down by Brazil' s Indian Affairs Department ( Funai) and the National Environment Agency, Ibama. Norte Energia said the temporary halt on the building work had not affected the project, as the project had not yet reached the stage where the company needed to do any of the specific type of work which had fallen under the ban. If the project goes ahead, the 11, 000 - megawatt dam will be the third biggest in the world - after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu, which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay. The government says the project is crucial to meeting growing energy needs, but environmentalists and those fighting for indigenous rights have been vociferous in environmentalists and those fighting for indigenous rights opposition.",

The rise was notable among men who have sex with men. At the same time, rates of genital warts decreased, thanks to a vaccination campaign. Rates of sexually transmitted infections as a group also went down slightly, totalling 434, 456. But experts say went could be because fewer people came forward for testing. Chlamydia was the most commonly diagnosed STI, accounting for nearly half of the cases diagnosed in 2015. Young people are routinely offered chlamydia screening, but only 13 % of young men and 32 % of young women were tested in 2015. The large fall in genital warts - a 7 % drop - was seen in young women, and experts say decreased was probably because of the national human papilloma virus vaccination programme. All girls aged 12 to 13 are offered the jab as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The FPA charity' s chief executive, Natika Halil, said boys should be offered the vaccine too, which is something ministers are considering.

Dr Gwenda Hughes, head of STI surveillance at PHE, said:\" Public Health England need to do more to raise awareness about STIs and how STIs can be prevented, especially the effectiveness of using condoms.\" Public Health England recommend that anyone having sex with a new or casual partner uses condoms and tests regularly for HIV and STIs.\"",

        "document": "Rather than having links to radical Islamism, Sergej W , 28 , was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say. The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury. Sergej W , 28 , has been identified only as Sergej W, and was staying in the team' s hotel overlooking the scene of the attack. Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus. Spanish footballer Marc Bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock. Following the attack on 11 April, Borussia Dortmund' s home Champions League match against Monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led Dortmund fans to open Dortmund fans doors to stranded away supporters. Police initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack. However, the following week, investigators cast\" significant doubt\" on jihadist motivations being behind the attack on 11 April. investigators now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed. Sergej W, 28, would have made about € 3. 9m euros ( $ 4. 2m; £ 3. 2m) from Sergej W , 28 , actions, Germany' s Bild newspaper reported. In a statement on Friday ( in German), the German federal prosecutor' s office said Sergej W , 28 , has German and Russian nationality. Sergej W , 28 , was arrested on Friday near Tubingen in Rottenburg, south - west Germany. The suspect had allegedly bought 15, 000 put options on Borussia Dortmund shares - reportedly priced at € 78, 000 ( £ 65, 000; $ 83, 600) - betting that 15 , 000 put options on Borussia Dortmund shares - reportedly priced at € 78 , 000 ( £ 65 , 000 ; $ 83 , 600 ) would drop sharply after the attack. Sergej W , 28 , would have made large profits if the team' s share price collapsed. Experts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because Sergej W , 28 , tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly. Sergej W , 28 , was staying at the team' s L ' Arrivée hotel in Dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where the attack on 11 April took place, prosecutors say. The suspect placed the bet on 11 April using an IP address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money. Investigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed. The bus was damaged about six miles from the Westfalenstadion - officially called Signal Iduna Park - in Dortmund about 90 minutes before kick - off. Pictures from the scene showed the bus windows broken and the bus tyres burst.",

The GMSF scheme identifies sites for housing developments that may be built over the next 20 years.

But the BBC' s Wyre Davies put the turnout at 10, 000 people, which the BBC ' s Wyre Davies said was the biggest protest seen in Jordan for several years. Video footage showed protesters chanting slogans and waving flags. The AFP news agency quoted people as shouting:\" people demand constitutional reform before the people revolt. The people want to reform the regime.\" A counter - rally, in support of King Abdullah, which organisers had predicted would attract 200, 000 supporters, was cancelled late on Thursday in order to prevent clashes between the two groups. Earlier, police said police had detained eight people travelling towards the rally and had seized three vehicles containing sticks, knives and guns. Friday' s protest in the capital and the dissolution of parliament come amid mounting opposition anger at the electoral law passed in July by the government of the conservative Prime Minister Fayez al - Tarawneh. The electoral law increased the number of seats in the House of Representatives from 120 to 150 seats and gave the electorate two votes - one for a district representative and one for national level lists that include political parties - replacing the single non - transferable vote. The IAF' s leader, Hamza Mansour, dismissed the legislation as\" just a cosmetic change meant to buy time and insufficient for real reforms\". Opposition parties demanded that 50 % of seats be allocated to party lists, but the new electoral law gave The opposition just 27 seats, or 18 %. The opposition also complained that the new law would strengthen supporters of the king by allocating three more seats for women from Bedouin districts. allocating, The opposition argued, would continue to marginalise Jordanians of Palestinian origin - who make up 60 % of the population but have little political power - in favour of those descended from Jordan' s original Bedouin inhabitants - whose tribes dominate the government and security forces and are the bedrock of the Hashemite monarchy. Traditionally, many of the IAF' s supporters have been Jordanians of Palestinian origin. The opposition also demanded that parliament, rather than the king, should have the right to appoint and dismiss the prime minister. Despite the call for reforms, Jordan has so far avoided the unrest and political upheaval that rocked much of the Arab world last year.

Mr Snowden later met Mr Snowden son, local media say. Edward Snowden was granted asylum in Russia in August after weeks spent in a transit zone at Moscow airport when the US revoked Mr Snowden travel documents. The 30 - year - old leaked many thousands of US intelligence documents. The information, published in The Guardian and Washington Post newspapers, revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by both US and British intelligence. In the US, Edward Snowden faces charges of theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10 - year prison sentence. Meanwhile, Edward Snowden met four former US security officials in Russia late on Wednesday, it has emerged. The officials - who now campaign against what four former US security officials describe as the misuse of state secrecy - said four former US security officials had presented Mr Snowden with the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence award. The award is given annually by a group of retired CIA officers. The officials told Russian media Mr Snowden had no regrets about leaking the classified files and was convinced Mr Snowden had done the right thing.\" Mr Snowden' s remarkably centred,\" ex - FBI agent Coleen Rowley told state - funded RT television.

That' s Mr Snowden decision, Mr Snowden' s an adult.\" Lon Snowden later visited Mr Snowden son, but the place and time of the meeting\" are not being been revealed for security reasons\", said Russia' s state - run TV channels Rossiya 24 and Channel One. Lon Snowden has in the past praised Mr Snowden son for speaking\" the truth\" and making great sacrifices, and has spoken of Mr Snowden concern that Mr Snowden would not face a fair trial if Mr Snowden returned to the US. Edward Snowden accessed many of the documents while working for the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii, where Mr Snowden had been living with Mr Snowden girlfriend. As the revelations became public, Mr Snowden fled to Hong Kong where, with Mr Snowden consent, The Guardian revealed Mr Snowden identity in June. To escape US attempts to extradite Mr Snowden, Mr Snowden moved on to Russia where Mr Snowden remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until Russia granted Mr Snowden asylum. Russia' s move added to already tense relations with the US. Washington cancelled a bilateral summit in September.",

A Malian army officer was quoted as denying the allegations. Meanwhile, the UN says 7, 100 civilians have fled to neighbouring states since 10 January to escape fighting. Reports suggesting that the mainly black African Malian army, drawn largely from the south, has targeted Arabs and ethnic Tuaregs from the north expose a racial aspect to the war here which has been hidden by the emphasis on western troops fighting a war against Islamist insurgents, the BBC' s Mark Doyle in Mali says.

France has bombed suspected rebel positions and deployed about 2, 000 troops to help the weak Malian army recapture territory. FIDH said there needed to be an independent investigation into alleged abuses committed by Malian soldiers and those responsible should be punished.

The International Federation for Human Rights ( FIDH ) added that some of the victims were accused of possessing weapons, and of being\" infiltrators\" and\" accomplices\" of the militants. Others were killed because Others did not have identity documents or simply because of Others ethnicity, FIDH said.

Native Americans and Native Americans supporters have protested against the project for months, and have vowed to fight on. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe say the final section - under Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River - would contaminate drinking water on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe land and damage sacred burial sites.

Age Scotland' s research, compiled using freedom of information requests, found significant variations across councils in the time taken to carry out assessments. Under national guidelines, people should wait no longer than six weeks for care services to be provided after an assessment has taken place. Age Scotland found that about 10 % of people were not provided with services within the six - week limit over the past three years. The charity said Age Scotland ' s research suggested that about 3, 000 elderly people each year wait longer than six weeks for services to be put in place. Most councils do not record the reasons why delays occur, but many cited instances where delays were caused by the person being admitted to hospital or waiting for a place in the person chosen care home. Staff shortages, financial constraints and delays in adapting homes were also cited. Age Scotland received freedom of information responses from 25 out of 32 councils.

By adding in the maximum new levies allowable without a referendum, the LGA estimated that Band D bills could cost an average of just under £ 200 more over the next five years. the LGA said an average of just under £ 200 more would not be enough, particularly as budgets continued to face new pressures such as those caused by an aging population. Any shortfall might have to be made up by further increases to costs such as car parking charges, the LGA added. One senior councillor said councils were now also facing\" a reckless gamble\" of having to use cash reserves to fund services. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said:\" In reality councils will have almost £ 200bn to spend on local services over the lifetime of this Parliament, a cash terms increase and a reduction of just 1. 7 % in real terms each year.\" The Spending Review offers a £ 3. 5bn package for adult social care to ensure councils can support councils older and most vulnerable residents, while at the same time council tax is expected to be less in 2019 - 20 in real terms than council tax was in 2010 - 11.\" With councils accounting for a quarter of all public spending it' s right councils continue to play councils part in paying off the deficit.\"",

Uzma ' s has accused Uzma ' s husband, Tahir Ali, of torturing Uzma ' s. her husband , Tahir Ali , denies the allegations. The incident comes amid increasing tension between India and Pakistan. On Thursday, India' s Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj tweeted, welcoming Uzma ' s return: Pakistani security officials escorted Uzma, who is in Uzma ' s early 20s, to the border crossing in the morning. Uzma ' s arrived in Delhi later in the day. Uzma' s return comes as India and Pakistan trade accusations over violence in disputed Kashmir, territory which both countries claim. Tensions also rose after Pakistan sentenced an Indian national, Kulbhushan Jadhav, to death on charges of spying. On Uzma ' s arrival in Delhi, Uzma described Pakistan as\" a death trap\".\" Uzma ' s' ve seen women who go there after arranged marriages. women who go there after arranged marriages' re miserable and living in terrible circumstances. There' re two, three, even four wives in every house,\" Uzma ' s told a press conference.\" If Uzma ' s' d remained there for a few days more, Uzma ' s would have died.\" Uzma met Tahir Ali in Malaysia and fell in love with her husband , Tahir Ali ,, according to reports. Uzma ' s then travelled to Pakistan earlier this month where, Uzma ' s said, Uzma ' s was forced into marriage on 3 May. While there is enough evidence to suggest that Uzma came to Pakistan of Uzma ' s own accord, it remains unclear why Uzma ' s changed Uzma ' s mind. Tahir Ali has said that her husband , Tahir Ali , father sponsored Uzma' s visa for Pakistan after the couple met in Malaysia and decided to get married. Uzma' s contention that Uzma ' s was married at\" gunpoint\" sits uneasily against the fact that Uzma ' s, along with Mr Ali and her husband , Tahir Ali , relatives, had visited a district court in Buner town to get married. The official who performed the wedding says Uzma ' s appeared to participate willingly in the ceremony. Mr Ali has alleged that Indian officials at the high commission forced Uzma ' s to change Uzma ' s mind. On 12 May, Uzma filed an appeal in the Islamabad High Court, accusing Uzma ' s husband of harassing and intimidating Uzma ' s, and taking away Uzma ' s travel documents to stop Uzma ' s from leaving Pakistan. Uzma ' s told the court that her husband , Tahir Ali , had not told Uzma ' s that her husband , Tahir Ali , was a married father of four and that Uzma ' s had been\" terribly beaten... tortured physically and mentally\". Uzma also has a five - year - old daughter from an earlier marriage. Uzma ' s lawyer requested that the court should allow Uzma ' s to go back to India, saying Uzma ' s daughter was thalassaemic and needed daily blood transfusions. Mr Ali told BBC' s M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad that the charges against Mr Ali were false - Mr Ali said she had known about Mr Ali marital status and was\" disappointed\" that Mr Ali was not allowed to speak to she under court' s supervision.

A Taliban spokesman denied the gunfight happened. Mullah Mansour' s appointment prompted splits in the Taliban after the Taliban founder Mullah Omar' s death emerged in July. A number of senior Taliban commanders refused to pledge allegiance to Mullah Mansour ' s and a faction opposed to Mullah Mansour ' s was set up last month under Mullah Mohammad Rasool. Read more The Taliban source said the firing seemed to be spontaneous rather than planned. Several other Taliban sources told the BBC that Mullah Mansour and Mullah Mansour ' s bodyguards had been at the house of another militant, Abdullah Sarhadi, when fighting broke out. Sarhadi is a Taliban figure with symbolic importance after spending years in US detention in Guantanamo Bay, reports the BBC' s Dawood Azami. Compared to Mullah Omar, Mullah Mansour ' s secretive predecessor, Mullah Mansour has adopted an open approach and has met Taliban commanders regularly to discuss Taliban commanders policy concerns, our correspondent says. What prompted the shooting in Quetta is unclear.\" During the discussion, some senior people developed differences and some senior people opened fire at each other,\" said a senior Taliban commander, Reuters reports. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid categorically rejected the reports.\" No such incident has happened, because Mullah Mansour ' s is in Afghanistan not in the area of Pakistan they have mentioned. Secondly Mullah Mansour ' s security is not weak to allow such an incident,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the BBC Afghan service. Mullah Omar died in 2013 but its founder Mullah Omar ' s death was only confirmed in July. News of its founder Mullah Omar ' s death disrupted fledgling peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Some senior Taliban leaders had been suspicious of Mullah Mansour' s support for peace talks hosted by neighbouring Pakistan, and accused pro - Pakistani circles of installing Mullah Mansour ' s as the new leader. Since August Mullah Mansour has overseen a series of battlefield victories, including briefly capturing the northern Afghan city of Kunduz - a huge setback for Western - backed Afghan forces. But the Islamist movement has split into openly warring factions since Mullah Omar died.

The Office of Rail and Road ( ORR) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy tickets that are too expensive for passengers who accidentally buy tickets that are too expensive for their journey journey. Train operators said that vending machines were designed for simple ticket requirements. Train operators say plans to simplify fares will help Train operators to give clearer information on ticket machines. The ORR employed mystery shoppers to buy rail tickets from machines.\" Despite investment in new technology and the removal of jargon from ticket machines, our new research shows passengers may be paying more for passengers journey than necessary,\" said John Larkinson, ORR director of railway markets and economics.\" The Office of Rail and Road ( ORR ) are calling on train companies to commit to refund anyone who finds that anyone who finds that they could have bought a cheaper ticket for the same journey could have bought a cheaper ticket for the same journey,\" John Larkinson , ORR director of railway markets and economics added. Rail operators C2C and Scotrail already have a price guarantee in place for when passengers overpay. Earlier this month, the Rail Delivery Group ( RDG), which represents train operators, announced a trial scheme to simplify fares. the Rail Delivery Group ( RDG ) , which represents train operators said the 16 million fares on offer were\" baffling\" for passengers. As part of the trial, which begins in May, ticket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure ticket machines on stations show the cheapest fares available.\" To quickly benefit passengers, the Rail Delivery Group must set out what improvements to ticket machines will be made in the short term,\" said Mr Larkinson. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG, told the BBC that operators were aware that there was a problem with machines, and that operators had formulated a 10 - point plan to improve the machines. Yet Paul Plummer , chief executive of the RDG pointed out the machines were designed as\" queue - busters\" for passengers with relatively simple requirements, but\" expectations [ of passengers] had evolved\". Paul Plummer , chief executive of the RDG said that the system of fares was far too complicated. The RDG also added:\" Complex, decades - old government rail fare regulations make it more difficult for train companies to offer the right, simple options on ticket machines.\" Simplifying the number and types of fares in the system will let train companies provide customers with clear information and help customers to make better informed choices,\" the Rail Delivery Group ( RDG ) , which represents train operators added. by Ben Morris, business reporter In the British Rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost - per mile basis. But in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies ( Tocs). The Tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to The Tocs, as advanced ticket bookings helps The Tocs to keep The Tocs trains full. To protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off - peak fares. The result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions. Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of a patchwork of fares , that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions by splitting Savvy travellers journey into several tickets, rather than one through - ticket.",

But Elin Jones has already ruled out the widespread sale of Welsh woodlands. Forestry Commission Wales said Forestry Commission Wales would explore the feasibility of transfer to the private sector case by case. The minister told BBC Radio Wales Elin Jones plans to\" compensate\" the public by buying new land for new planting or management if any forest was sold off on a case - by - case basis.\" Elin Jones don' t want any stagnancy in the forest estate. Elin Jones want the publicly owned estate to work for public benefit whether public benefit' s economic or environmental or access benefit,\" Elin Jones said.\" It' s Elin Jones view there should be no reduction in the publicly owned estate and Elin Jones have asked the Forestry Commission to look at how Forestry Commission Wales can make that estate work harder, provide a better return for the public.\" Whether that' s in terms of public access, in terms of environmental benefit in the production of renewable energy or biomass potential or also in terms of the economic return from that forestry estate.\" The minister is due to outline Elin Jones plans to AMs during Tuesday' s plenary session in the Senedd. Further commercialisation being planned would include partnerships with the private sector for more forest holidays, wind farms and limited extraction of coalfield methane. Around 37 % of Welsh woodland comes under the Assembly Government Woodland Estate ( AGWE). A report commissioned by the assembly examined a number of options, including a complete sell - off of the land to the private sector or a not - for - profit trust. The report warned there were potential difficulties with both of these, instead recommending that a case - by - case approach should be taken to the future of Wales ' forests. Jerry Langford, the Woodland Trust' s director in Wales gave a guarded welcome and said the plans were\" considered and enlightened\".\" If these changes do lead to more native woodland creation and a new urgency for the restoration of ancient woodlands planted with conifers, this could be the start of a new ' age of the tree ' in Wales,\" Jerry Langford , the Woodland Trust ' s director in Wales said. Any sell - off in Wales would release resources to the FC to purchase other areas of land not currently under Forestry Commission Wales management to increase other areas of land not currently under its management public benefit. Overall, there would be no reduction in the size of the Welsh forests in public ownership. The report states:\" The minister agreed that FC Wales should adopt whenever possible a more commercial approach to Forestry Commission Wales management of the estate and in particular to be pro - active and imaginative in exploring opportunities for deeper commercialisation when dealing with the private sector.\" Forestry Commission Wales said Forestry Commission Wales would\" explore the feasibility of small - scale transfer to the third sector on a case by case basis\". A spokesman said:\" small - scale transfer to the third sector would be subject to proper safeguards being in place to ensure that the woodland continues to be sustainably managed and that the woodland can continue to deliver key benefits such as access for the public.\"",

Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw had written on Tuesday to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan with the findings of inspections of 22 private faith schools, in cities including Manchester, Coventry, Birmingham and Leicester. 22 private faith schools , in cities including Manchester , Coventry , Birmingham and Leicester had formerly been inspected by an independent group - the Bridge Schools Inspectorate - but from this autumn Ofsted has taken over responsibility for carrying out checks. Religious studies GCSE ' error of law ' Inspectors raised concerns including that some of these private faith schools were not\" promoting fundamental British values\" and were not encouraging\" mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs\". Inspectors highlighted particular concern about Darul Uloom Islamic High School in Birmingham, where inspectors observed that\" the only female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room to the main meeting.\" As a result, the unnamed governor could only contribute to the meeting through a doorway.

Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett , who recently visited Calais told Radio Kent:\" migrants think Calais' s a great place to be and ( Britain' s) migrants target. migrants will do anything migrants possibly can to get into the UK.\" Last week, Channel Tunnel services were delayed and cancelled after immigrants entered restricted areas on the French side. And last month hundreds of migrants tried to board UK - bound lorries amid chaos as a strike forced the suspension of services through the tunnel. Eurotunnel said at the time that the number of migrants in the Calais area was the\" highest ever\". Hauliers have been advised by the Freight Transport Association not to stop within about 60 miles ( 97km) of Calais, to stick with other drivers and make sure padlocks are always kept on vehicles. Responding to the latest figures, a Home Office spokesman said 40, 000 attempted illegal crossings of the Channel had been foiled last year. a Home Office spokesman added:\" The Home Office are providing funding to bolster the security of ports in northern France and Belgium, including a Â £ 2m upgrade of detection technology, a Â £ 1m extension of dog searching capacity and Â £ 12m to reinforce security at Calais and other ports.\" During the current period of disruption to cross - Channel services, Border Force has put Border Force contingency plans into operation to ensure security is maintained.\" The Home Office have deployed additional Border Force staff and sniffer dogs in northern France as well as bolstering screening checks at Dover for both tourist and freight vehicles.\" The Port of Dover Police is a non - Home Office constabulary funded entirely by the port authority, Dover Harbour Board. Port of Dover Police is not responsible for border security, which is down to the Border Agency and Kent Police frontier operations.",

In addition, annual payments to most members, including those already retired, would be less in the PPF than if the Hoover scheme continued. At about £ 500m, the pension scheme is roughly the same size as BHS. BHS pensions is already receiving compensation from PPF which acts as a lifeboat for pensions so people are paid even when a company goes bust or is about to and if there are insufficient assets in the scheme.

Labour said new homes were urgently needed but\" driving out hard - working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" was not the answer. In think tank Policy Exchange Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O ' Brien, the think tank' s director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under think tank Policy Exchange proposal, but there would just be\" less of social housing\".\" The truth is Neil O ' Brien , the think tank ' s director don' t believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town.\" People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" Neil O ' Brien , the think tank ' s director said. Neil O ' Brien , the think tank ' s director also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1. 8 million, could be reduced by about 500, 000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister' s official spokesman said:\" the scheme is something that councils can choose to do already.\" Councils should be looking for ways to use Councils social housing stock as efficiently as Councils can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years.\" Councils need to think about how Councils can use that social housing stock efficiently.\" If Councils can sell high - value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then sell is certainly something Councils should look at.\" But Labour said the coalition' s\" failed\" polices were\" making the housing crisis worse not better\". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said:\" Councils and housing associations should make effective use of Councils and housing associations housing stock but the government should not force Councils and housing associations to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard - working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\" Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250, 000 affordable homes and\" put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry. ' Lucky family ' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21. 8 % of the total social housing stock in the UK, think tank Policy Exchange says. This equates to 816, 000 properties - out of a total of 3. 78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £ 159bn if sold. the think tank says London alone has more than £ 70bn of expensive social housing. About 3. 5 % of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. becomes meant the government could sell a total of 28, 500 properties each year, raising £ 5. 5bn a year. The figure would stand at £ 4. 5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O ' Brien argued that many hard - working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to.\" Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing heads.\" have seems fairer to Mr O ' Brien,\" Mr O ' Brien added. The think tank also said the move would be\" extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73 % of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. ' Dramatic erosion ' Critics say such a move would push the least well - off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be\" cleansed\" of\" hardworking people who can' t afford to pay high prices\". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government' s £ 8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60 % when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell - off - said the government had introduced\" radical reforms\" to\" get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. \" radical reforms \" to \" get Britain building \" and to reduce social housing waiting lists included investing £ 19. 5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme\" set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170, 000 homes\". Councils could now offer fixed - term tenancies to new tenants to make sure\" social housing goes to those in greatest need\", he added.",

Cuadrilla Resources will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey ( BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton - le - Fylde on 1 April shared a\" similar location and mechanism\", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as\" fracking\", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said:\" Cuadrilla Resources take our responsibilities very seriously and take is why Cuadrilla Resources have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts.\" Cuadrilla Resources expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and Cuadrilla Resources will decide on appropriate actions after that.\" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into environmentalists drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with the process in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said the British Geological Survey ( BGS ) was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on the British Geological Survey ( BGS ) website the BGS said:\" Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.\" It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.\" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1. 2 miles ( 2km) away from the drilling site but said the British Geological Survey ( BGS ) monitoring instruments were 50 miles ( 80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said:\" The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton - Le - Fylde.\" Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.\" Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2. 3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km ( 1. 2 miles).\" The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2. 3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.\"",

        "document": "It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result McLaren are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23. 18 %, 12 drivers ' world championships, and eight constructors ' titles. And which still, despite McLaren dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of two world champions, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost McLaren way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got McLaren mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power - unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved McLaren greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, McLaren swept a season like no - one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in McLaren cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, McLaren won 15 of the 16 races. McLaren dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998 - 99. Amazingly, the team' s last constructors ' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the ' flying Finn '. McLaren should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team - mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors ' championship that year - and fined $ 100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from McLaren illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed ' lie - gate ' - after Hamilton and sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team - mate Jenson Button won seven races between Hamilton and team - mate Jenson Button, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton' s in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, McLaren current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren' s F1 history has, like those of many long - term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. McLaren ' s first decade, following the team' s establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder' s death in a testing crash in 1970. McLaren ' s maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in James Hunt now - famous battle with Ferrari' s Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co - team boss. Ron Dennis , first as co - team boss took complete control shortly afterwards and has held complete control ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to McLaren ' s first period of real domination in 1984 - 5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team' s disastrous 2013 season. So far, Ron Dennis , first as co - team boss return has not had his return intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, Ron Dennis , first as co - team boss told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team' s golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes ' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship Alonso had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two - time champion left Ferrari because Alonso felt Ferrari ' s would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because Alonso felt the renewed Honda partnership was Alonso best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and Ron Dennis , first as co - team boss lieutenants believe Dennis and his lieutenants are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re - entered F1 too soon - will ensure Honda - who last year re - entered F1 too soon - engine is, too. Dennis and his lieutenants can see the progress, Dennis and his lieutenants say, and it is only a matter of time before Dennis and his lieutenants again deliver\" championships, plural\", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all Dennis and his lieutenants have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport' s greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of the sport ' s greatest names.

The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km ( 13 miles) from the city of Grozny.\" All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya.

The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is\" a new low\". Investing Solutions said\" the bulk\" of Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water , rats and damp rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said The charity , Fresh Start Housing referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property' s landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help\" the needs of current and ex - offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £ 2, 114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £ 1, 150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £ 11, 568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying focuses is because single homeless men over the age of 35 is the group facing\" the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, allows means Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water , rats and damp can charge up to £ 260 per week for each private room.

The charity , Fresh Start Housing passed One of the tenants , Nigel McCann to Investing Solutions who housed One of the tenants , Nigel McCann in several properties that One of the tenants , Nigel McCann describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. One of the tenants , Nigel McCann says One of the tenants , Nigel McCann had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make one house habitable. Mr McCann said One of the tenants , Nigel McCann became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after One of the tenants , Nigel McCann did some work for Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water , rats and damp in 2014.\" It' s all about the money, it' s not about the people,\" One of the tenants , Nigel McCann added.\" One of the tenants , Nigel McCann thought inspections would be made.\" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £ 2. 1m.

Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said:\" homeless charity Crisis' ve heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice.

The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport the Nevada Athletic Commission ( NAC ) expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating:\" Mayweather , 40' ll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, Mayweather , 40 team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport NAC executive director Bob Bennett had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified.\" Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett.\" To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\" During The UFC lightweight champion ' s UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and The UFC lightweight champion ' s welcomed Mayweather' s Instagram post last week, stating:\" The UFC lightweight champion ' s am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know coming. Brittle hands.\" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing the Nevada Athletic Commission ( NAC ) decision. McGregor, 29, will make The UFC lightweight champion ' s boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion' s move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says NAC executive director Bob Bennett studied a\" litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling NAC executive director Bob Bennett chairman there were\" several reasons to approve the fight\". Bennett said that McGregor' s UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in NAC executive director Bob Bennett forming NAC executive director Bob Bennett opinion.\" NAC executive director Bob Bennett spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett.\" Virgil Hunter , who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said Virgil Hunter , who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward rated McGregor ' s UFC rival Nate Diaz as an outstanding boxer.\" Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks McGregor ' s UFC rival Nate Diaz down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite - like chin, add in that The UFC lightweight champion ' s' s 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that The UFC lightweight champion ' s' s taller and longer. \" Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, Floyd has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But Floyd hasn' t knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when Ricky Hatton KO' d Victor Ortiz in 2010, Ricky Hatton wasn' t defending Ricky Hatton.\" That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\" McGregor floored Diaz three times on McGregor ' s way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor' s progress and told BBC Sport:\" McGregor ' s' s good to go.\" Bennett also advised McGregor' s camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez , 73 oversaw an\" out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi.

For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation' s biggest newspapers. Ex - Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said Fleet Street was once a\" very, very important place\" through which most of the public received most of the public information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At Fleet Street height,\" the Street of Shame\" - as Fleet Street was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist' s career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half - mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. Mr Smith , 43 is quick to point out that the paper' s London address is the same as Sweeney Todd' s barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to Sweeney Todd ' s clients ' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, Mr Smith , 43 says the death of journalism was announced too soon by some of London' s tour guides.\" Mr Smith , 43 was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. Mr Smith , 43 heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here.\" Mr Smith , 43 stuck Mr Smith , 43 head out and shouted: ' We are still here '.\" The street was famous for Fleet Street many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. Mr Smith , 43 says Mr Smith , 43 was not allowed in until Mr Smith , 43 squeezed into an ill - fitting jacket, provided by the staff.\" There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, Mr Smith , 43 feel unworthy of the torch that Mr Smith , 43' m carrying.\" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post' s London chief reporter. Mr Sherriff , 54 says on Mr Sherriff , 54 first ever day Mr Sherriff , 54 walked into a smoke - filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about.\" The phones didn' t even work properly, Mr Sherriff , 54' d be amazed if Mr Sherriff , 54 called someone and it connected the first time.\" Mr Sherriff , 54 memories of the street in Fleet Street heyday are of\" watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side - streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers\".\" Now it' s an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago.\" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of\" certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn' t be able to produce newspapers now the way produce was done back then\". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write Mr Sherriff memoirs. Robin Esser' s Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time Robin Esser ' s also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail.\" At Fleet Street ' s height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in television early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85 % of information to the public came through the newspapers,\" Robin Esser ' s says.\" The departure of Fleet Street ' s last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards.\" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and Liz Hodgkinson book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there.\" Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street.\" But papers like the Sunday People , the Sun and the Mail were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street.\" When Liz Hodgkinson was at the People we' d have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open the editor drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one.\" Then we' d take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. we' d come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm.\" The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street.\" At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool.\" Liz Hodgkinson was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with an editor.\" an editor asked ' Are Liz Hodgkinson in danger, pet? ' Liz Hodgkinson replied ' Yes, Liz Hodgkinson am '. To which an editor replied ' Oh, good. '\" But, like so many empires before Fleet Street ' s, Fleet Street' s grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch papers - consisting of the Sun, the now - closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose - built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year - long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings most national newspapers left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury' s supermarkets, for example, and the\" Stab in the Back\" is a Pizza Express. Now a part of Fleet Street' s own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached this infamous era of British history final deadline.\" As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites Mr Smith,\" says Mr Smith.\" It makes Mr Smith smile, when Mr Smith think of how Mr Smith now have that place in history.\"",

        "document": "the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime , by the University of Edinburgh ' s School of Law found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better - off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. University of Edinburgh researchers found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than Poorer young people better - off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. University of Edinburgh researchers found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. were was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh' s School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4, 300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in 4 , 300 young people in Edinburgh behaviour and lifestyles. the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime , by the University of Edinburgh ' s School of Law has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said:\" Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty.\" As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network ( AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh' s Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20 % of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20 % of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said:\" The findings are important as The findings suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and tends has not changed despite crime being at crime lowest level for decades.\" tends raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\" A Scottish government spokesman said:\" Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41 - year low, homicide figures at homicide figures lowest level in 39 years and 1, 000 extra officers on our streets.\" The Scottish government has a long - standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and the Scottish government are tackling poverty and inequalities head - on through a number of initiatives including a Â £ 296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government' s welfare cuts.\"",

        "document": "this exercise is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters own patrols in these very same waters. this exercise has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain' s own defences. For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U - boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves. U33' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf and U33 ' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships. U33 ' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew , who live in cramped conditions task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When U33 ' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew , who live in cramped conditions dive the only visible sign of U33 ' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew , who live in cramped conditions presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares Rear Admiral Brad Williamson fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. Rear Admiral Brad Williamson says this exercise is important training and that Rear Admiral Brad Williamson crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. Rear Admiral Brad Williamson says the training\" focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it' s not theoretical that the guys in combat might have to do anti - submarine warfare\". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg' s anti - submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. Lieutenant Colin Ryan , Vicksburg ' s anti - submarine warfare officer says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether submarines have been Russian, Lieutenant Colin Ryan , Vicksburg ' s anti - submarine warfare officer replies nervously:\" Lieutenant Colin Ryan , Vicksburg ' s anti - submarine warfare officer wouldn' t want to comment on that,\" before adding:\" In general, they' re always on the lookout.\" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of Nato members own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia' s increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting many European nations defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what Russia claims is the\" quietest submarine in the world\". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says Russia now leads the world in submarine development. Peter Roberts , a former Royal Navy officer , and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI describes them as technologically advanced and them crews as highly skilled. them are, Peter Roberts , a former Royal Navy officer , and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI says, the\" quietest and most challenging adversary in the world\". When out on patrol them can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of them presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. them lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and\" fingerprinting\" other nations ' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named\" Dynamic Mongoose\", as well as the warships there are anti - submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist - in - charge at Nato' s Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on the underwater robots , which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. the underwater robots , which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm' s way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation' s armoury to conduct anti - submarine warfare is the long - range maritime patrol aircraft. the long - range maritime patrol aircraft are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of the UK ' s own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK' s defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on the UK ' s Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain' s waters. RUSI' s Mr Roberts says a significant gap in the UK ' s defences is a\" key vulnerability\". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as the nuclear deterrent leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, He says, should be\" exceptionally worried\" that the UK is seen as a\" soft touch\", because Russia will continue to test the UK defences, just as Russia have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti - submarine warfare. But this exercise is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do anti - submarine warfare alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government' s forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",

        "document": "United Nations officials rarely use the words\" genocide\" and\" ethnic cleansing,\" but United Nations officials now say potentially both could envelop the world' s youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340, 000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200, 000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2, 500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what another 2 , 500 South Sudanese escaped and what another 2 , 500 South Sudanese saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time Nelson Ladu Thomas crossed was with Nelson Ladu Thomas immediate family; the second - a day later - was with Nelson Ladu Thomas brother' s wife and his brother ' s wife five children who Nelson Ladu Thomas had gone back to help. Six - year - old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where his brother ' s wife and her five children who he had gone back to help possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked Six - year - old Moriswani what his brother ' s wife and her five children who he had gone back to help had left behind.\" They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, They are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,\" Mr Thomas told I. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun.\" They don' t want us,\" Nelson Ladu Thomas said, and gave Nelson Ladu Thomas explanation of why Nelson Ladu Thomas town of Yei, just 80km ( 50 miles) from the border, had become a place Nelson Ladu Thomas had to leave.\" These tribes of Dinka, These tribes of Dinka don' t want Equatorians, These tribes of Dinka don' t want … Nuer. These tribes of Dinka don' t want Nuer.\" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice - President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to Equatorians part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how Otima Amos , 21 had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among 16 other people - most children , and among them two - year - old twins two - year - old twins. \" We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,\" he said.\" walked was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.\" We were afraid We would be caught as We tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with Faida Sarah children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason Faida Sarah left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to Faida Sarah home, demanded car keys from Faida Sarah husband and then hacked her husband to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now Bidi Bidi is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with Uganda generous approach.\" This has been unrelenting since July,\" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR' s senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda.\" The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop This, as This' s a massacre of civilians from both sides.\" Nasir Abel Fernandes , the UNHCR ' s senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as water has to be trucked in.

The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present All three as independent activists, separate from other, government - sponsored groups. The most prominent pro - Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev - based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, Kiev - based programmer Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia' s Rostov region - bordering Ukraine' s eastern separatist regions.\" Kiev - based programmer Yevhen Dokukin gave all this data to Ukraine' s security service, but Ukraine ' s security services still can' t get round to analysing the data, so do analysing yourselves,\" Kiev - based programmer Yevhen Dokukin urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial - of - service ( DDoS) attack.\" DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops ' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded Scores of rebel websites with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, the Ukrainian Cyber Troops , led by Kiev - based programmer Yevhen Dokukin target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel - held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor rebel - held areas of eastern Ukraine for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro - Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine' s security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny used.\" Ukraine ' s security services only use data obtained by people Ukraine ' s security services trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti - Western group which takes Cyber Berkut , a staunchly anti - Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group' s declared goal is thwarting Ukraine' s military plans and thus stopping the\" genocide\" that Cyber Berkut , a staunchly anti - Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych accuses Kiev of unleashing at America' s behest. Cyber Berkut , a staunchly anti - Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych motto is\" Cyber Berkut , a staunchly anti - Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych won' t forgive or forget\", and Cyber Berkut , a staunchly anti - Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice - President Joe Biden' s visit to Kiev on 20 - 21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on several Ukrainian government websites front pages which read:\" Joseph Biden is the fascists ' master.\" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden' s team while Mr Biden ' s team was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington' s military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists\" war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. Cyber Berkut also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote - counting systems ahead of October' s parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko' s website.

The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made Russian activist group Anonymous International name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin.

The group focuses on Russia' s domestic affairs, but some of Russian activist group Anonymous International material covers Ukraine. In November Russian activist group Anonymous International published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces.

There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland.\" And both the country and parliament are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of assume\". Mr Salmond , who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which Mr Salmond , who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign.

Ms Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for Mr Salmond , who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that Mr Salmond , who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget had\" served the parliament and Scotland with distinction\". The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since Holyrood was established in 1999. Mr McNeil used veteran Labour MSP Duncan McNeil address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system. Mr McNeil said:\" It will be this parliament' s responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary.\" Holyrood must ensure Holyrood are capable of meeting that challenge, or Holyrood will face the consequences.\" Mr McNeil recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster. But Mr McNeil said:\" It saddens Mr McNeil to say Holyrood now have to do a bit of learning from them and how them run them business.\" Former Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood.

Meanwhile, women' s equality campaigners said Matching Models in London ads were\" straight out of the 1970s\". Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said:\" It is extraordinary that Matching Models in London are taking this approach and almost certainly falls foul of equality legislation.\" If we ever wonder why the battle for gender equality hasn' t been won, this is a timely reminder.\" The agency' s founder Nathalie Jansen said:\" Our clients are important to Matching Models in London - and looks are important.\" Another job advert on the agency' s website asks a\" sexy female driver\" to drive a Porsche Cayenne two days a week for between £ 40, 000 and £ 50, 000 - a - year for a Knightsbridge - based businessman and polo team owner.

East Sussex' s fire authority said East Sussex Fire Authority would co - operate with the PCC but East Sussex Fire Authority believed collaboration could be achieved without elaborate structural change. Ms Bourne said Sussex PCC Katy Bourne had written to WSCC leader Louise Goldsmith and Phil Howson, East Sussex Fire Authority chairman, to request WSCC leader Louise Goldsmith and Phil Howson , East Sussex Fire Authority chairman begin to look at the feasibility of bringing both fire services under Sussex PCC Katy Bourne authority.\" Just as West Sussex have one police force that effectively manages the county, West Sussex need to understand if one fire service not two could achieve the same,\" Sussex PCC Katy Bourne said. Ms Bourne' s letter met with cross - party opposition from WSCC. And Ms Goldsmith also invited the home secretary to visit West Sussex and see an alternative to the government' s preferred plan. Ms Goldsmith said West Sussex fire service was already integrated within the council and served communities.

        "document": "The regulator, NHS Improvement, said The regulator , NHS Improvement wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in the NHS efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £ 3. 6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants £ 3 . 6bn brought down by £ 1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £ 600m, the regulator said. A cap means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55 % above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce hospitals reliance on agency staff. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when the NHS buys Agency staff in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was\" promising\", but the progress being made still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10 % down on where NHS trusts wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS\" bank\" staff - effectively the health service' s in - house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said The regulator , NHS Improvement would start publishing\" league tables\" of the best and worst - performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest - earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. The regulator , NHS Improvement found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £ 130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £ 76, while another was quoted £ 70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £ 35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said:\" The NHS simply doesn' t have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There' s much more to be done.\"",

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground - based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference ( WRC), organised by the UN' s International Telecommunication Union ( ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast ( ADS - B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow\" real - time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,\" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU' s Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70 % of the world' s airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia' s communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real - time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with The Malaysia Airlines flight. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island.

Mr Szijjarto said Mr Szijjarto had already won backing from Poland that Warsaw would veto any move to strip Hungary of Hungary ' s EU voting rights. The EU objects to Hungary' s tight controls on asylum seekers and non - governmental organisations ( NGOs), as well as a higher education law. Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros. Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months.

EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of a member country voting rights should be approved unanimously. Hungary' s right - wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed, the BBC' s Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports.

Britain is currently the world' s third largest importer of wood. Ministers said Ministers were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16, 000 hectares - or 40, 000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re - planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, the timber industry is estimated to be worth more than Â £ 450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents.

Within this rapidly growing accumulation, My often come across labels and subjects that My get curious about and that is how My collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled\" Matchbox Labels And The Stories Matchbox Labels Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. My exhibited 5, 000 labels from My collection of 25, 000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. AE Matcheswala set up AE Matcheswala factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat ( also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported AE Matcheswala matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and Very few Wimco labels did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of Wimco common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi ( self - reliance) movement during the partition of India' s Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to Most firms brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India' s struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It' s believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.",

From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales. But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months. This deferral period has been left in place because there is a\" window period\" after infection with blood - borne viruses where blood - borne viruses are not detectable. This window period is far less than 12 months. The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs ( SaBTO) says that for HIV a \" window period \" after infection with blood - borne viruses where they are not detectable varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test. For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, a \" window period \" after infection with blood - borne viruses where they are not detectable is 66 days. In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would - be donor is heterosexual or gay. In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner. By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men. Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long. Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill.\" To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if any man who has had sex with another man in the last year has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence.\" But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said:\" The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on sexually active gay men heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood - borne viruses.\" A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV / Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute. NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate. The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.

A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said the council tax had built - in problems\" from day one\" but a failure to modify the current council tax had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. Prof Kenneth Gibb , from the University of Glasgow found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a\" good tax\" because a tax on property was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But a tax on property also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether a tax on property was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt a tax on property was unfair because a tax on property was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But Prof Kenneth Gibb , from the University of Glasgow found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because such a system meant local authorities income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. Prof Kenneth Gibb , from the University of Glasgow said:\" It is clear there is no magic bullet.\" Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\" So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing the cross - party Commission on Local Tax Reform report in the autumn.

Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co - operation Council ( GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven - point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy.\" Bahrain had an agreement with the crown prince,\" Sheikh Ali Salman said.\" The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue.\" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said Sheikh Ali Salman was\" hopeful\" that Senator John Kerry would\" do more than Senator John Kerry predecessor\", Hillary Clinton.\" US policy needs to be more clear and direct.

Labour said new homes were urgently needed but\" driving out hard - working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" was not the answer. In think tank Policy Exchange Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O ' Brien, the think tank' s director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under think tank Policy Exchange proposal, but there would just be\" less of social housing\".\" The truth is Neil O ' Brien , the think tank ' s director don' t believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town.\" People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" Neil O ' Brien , the think tank ' s director said. Neil O ' Brien , the think tank ' s director also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1. 8 million, could be reduced by about 500, 000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister' s official spokesman said:\" the scheme is something that councils can choose to do already.\" Councils should be looking for ways to use Councils social housing stock as efficiently as Councils can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years.\" Councils need to think about how Councils can use that social housing stock efficiently.\" If Councils can sell high - value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then sell is certainly something Councils should look at.\" But Labour said the coalition' s\" failed\" polices were\" making the housing crisis worse not better\". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said:\" Councils and housing associations should make effective use of Councils and housing associations housing stock but the government should not force Councils and housing associations to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard - working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\" Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250, 000 affordable homes and\" put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry. ' Lucky family ' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21. 8 % of the total social housing stock in the UK, think tank Policy Exchange says. This equates to 816, 000 properties - out of a total of 3. 78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £ 159bn if sold. the think tank says London alone has more than £ 70bn of expensive social housing. About 3. 5 % of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. becomes meant the government could sell a total of 28, 500 properties each year, raising £ 5. 5bn a year. The figure would stand at £ 4. 5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O ' Brien argued that many hard - working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to.\" Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing heads.\" have seems fairer to Mr O ' Brien,\" Mr O ' Brien added. The think tank also said the move would be\" extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73 % of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. ' Dramatic erosion ' Critics say such a move would push the least well - off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos.

Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government' s £ 8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60 % when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell - off - said the government had introduced\" radical reforms\" to\" get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. \" radical reforms \" to \" get Britain building \" and to reduce social housing waiting lists included investing £ 19. 5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme\" set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170, 000 homes\".

A tremor centred on Poulton - le - Fylde on 1 April shared a\" similar location and mechanism\", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as\" fracking\", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said:\" Cuadrilla Resources take our responsibilities very seriously and take is why Cuadrilla Resources have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts.\" Cuadrilla Resources expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and Cuadrilla Resources will decide on appropriate actions after that.\" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into environmentalists drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with the process in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said the British Geological Survey ( BGS ) was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on the British Geological Survey ( BGS ) website the BGS said:\" Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.\" It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.\" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1. 2 miles ( 2km) away from the drilling site but said the British Geological Survey ( BGS ) monitoring instruments were 50 miles ( 80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said:\" The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton - Le - Fylde.\" Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.\" Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2. 3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km ( 1. 2 miles).\" The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2. 3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.\"",

        "document": "It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result McLaren are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23. 18 %, 12 drivers ' world championships, and eight constructors ' titles. And which still, despite McLaren dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of two world champions, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost McLaren way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got McLaren mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power - unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved McLaren greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, McLaren swept a season like no - one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in McLaren cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, McLaren won 15 of the 16 races. McLaren dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998 - 99. Amazingly, the team' s last constructors ' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the ' flying Finn '. McLaren should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team - mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors ' championship that year - and fined $ 100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from McLaren illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed ' lie - gate ' - after Hamilton and sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team - mate Jenson Button won seven races between Hamilton and team - mate Jenson Button, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton' s in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, McLaren current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren' s F1 history has, like those of many long - term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. McLaren ' s first decade, following the team' s establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder' s death in a testing crash in 1970. McLaren ' s maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in James Hunt now - famous battle with Ferrari' s Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co - team boss. Ron Dennis , first as co - team boss took complete control shortly afterwards and has held complete control ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to McLaren ' s first period of real domination in 1984 - 5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team' s disastrous 2013 season. So far, Ron Dennis , first as co - team boss return has not had his return intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, Ron Dennis , first as co - team boss told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team' s golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes ' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship Alonso had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two - time champion left Ferrari because Alonso felt Ferrari ' s would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because Alonso felt the renewed Honda partnership was Alonso best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and Ron Dennis , first as co - team boss lieutenants believe Dennis and his lieutenants are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re - entered F1 too soon - will ensure Honda - who last year re - entered F1 too soon - engine is, too. Dennis and his lieutenants can see the progress, Dennis and his lieutenants say, and it is only a matter of time before Dennis and his lieutenants again deliver\" championships, plural\", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all Dennis and his lieutenants have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport' s greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of the sport ' s greatest names.

On 1 April Novaya Gazeta ' s reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed. The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km ( 13 miles) from the city of Grozny.\" All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya.

The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is\" a new low\". Investing Solutions said\" the bulk\" of Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water , rats and damp rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said The charity , Fresh Start Housing referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property' s landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help\" the needs of current and ex - offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £ 2, 114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £ 1, 150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £ 11, 568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying focuses is because single homeless men over the age of 35 is the group facing\" the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, allows means Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water , rats and damp can charge up to £ 260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when One of the tenants , Nigel McCann was referred to Fresh Start Housing. The charity , Fresh Start Housing passed One of the tenants , Nigel McCann to Investing Solutions who housed One of the tenants , Nigel McCann in several properties that One of the tenants , Nigel McCann describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. One of the tenants , Nigel McCann says One of the tenants , Nigel McCann had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make one house habitable. Mr McCann said One of the tenants , Nigel McCann became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after One of the tenants , Nigel McCann did some work for Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water , rats and damp in 2014.\" It' s all about the money, it' s not about the people,\" One of the tenants , Nigel McCann added.\" One of the tenants , Nigel McCann thought inspections would be made.\" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £ 2. 1m. The council said Wandsworth Council in south London , which has paid the lettings agency more than £ 2 . 1m has a\" dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said:\" homeless charity Crisis' ve heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with Fresh Start Housing own board of trustees. Samir Patel also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords\" who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". Samir Patel also said Samir Patel company was\" genuinely concerned by some of homeless charity Crisis allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client' s property\".

        "document": "The former five - weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission ( NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport the Nevada Athletic Commission ( NAC ) expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating:\" Mayweather , 40' ll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, Mayweather , 40 team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport NAC executive director Bob Bennett had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified.\" Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett.\" To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\" During The UFC lightweight champion ' s UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and The UFC lightweight champion ' s welcomed Mayweather' s Instagram post last week, stating:\" The UFC lightweight champion ' s am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know coming. Brittle hands.\" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing the Nevada Athletic Commission ( NAC ) decision. McGregor, 29, will make The UFC lightweight champion ' s boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion' s move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says NAC executive director Bob Bennett studied a\" litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling NAC executive director Bob Bennett chairman there were\" several reasons to approve the fight\". Bennett said that McGregor' s UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in NAC executive director Bob Bennett forming NAC executive director Bob Bennett opinion.\" NAC executive director Bob Bennett spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett.\" Virgil Hunter , who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said Virgil Hunter , who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward rated McGregor ' s UFC rival Nate Diaz as an outstanding boxer.\" Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks McGregor ' s UFC rival Nate Diaz down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite - like chin, add in that The UFC lightweight champion ' s' s 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that The UFC lightweight champion ' s' s taller and longer. \" Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, Floyd has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But Floyd hasn' t knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when Ricky Hatton KO' d Victor Ortiz in 2010, Ricky Hatton wasn' t defending Ricky Hatton.\" That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\" McGregor floored Diaz three times on McGregor ' s way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor' s progress and told BBC Sport:\" McGregor ' s' s good to go.\" Bennett also advised McGregor' s camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez , 73 oversaw an\" out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi.

For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation' s biggest newspapers. Ex - Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said Fleet Street was once a\" very, very important place\" through which most of the public received most of the public information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At Fleet Street height,\" the Street of Shame\" - as Fleet Street was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist' s career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half - mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. Mr Smith , 43 is quick to point out that the paper' s London address is the same as Sweeney Todd' s barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to Sweeney Todd ' s clients ' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, Mr Smith , 43 says the death of journalism was announced too soon by some of London' s tour guides.\" Mr Smith , 43 was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. Mr Smith , 43 heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here.\" Mr Smith , 43 stuck Mr Smith , 43 head out and shouted: ' We are still here '.\" The street was famous for Fleet Street many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. Mr Smith , 43 says Mr Smith , 43 was not allowed in until Mr Smith , 43 squeezed into an ill - fitting jacket, provided by the staff.\" There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, Mr Smith , 43 feel unworthy of the torch that Mr Smith , 43' m carrying.\" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post' s London chief reporter. Mr Sherriff , 54 says on Mr Sherriff , 54 first ever day Mr Sherriff , 54 walked into a smoke - filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about.\" The phones didn' t even work properly, Mr Sherriff , 54' d be amazed if Mr Sherriff , 54 called someone and it connected the first time.\" Mr Sherriff , 54 memories of the street in Fleet Street heyday are of\" watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side - streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers\".\" Now it' s an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago.\" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of\" certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn' t be able to produce newspapers now the way produce was done back then\". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write Mr Sherriff memoirs. Robin Esser' s Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time Robin Esser ' s also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail.\" At Fleet Street ' s height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in television early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85 % of information to the public came through the newspapers,\" Robin Esser ' s says.\" The departure of Fleet Street ' s last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards.\" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and Liz Hodgkinson book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there.\" Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street.\" But papers like the Sunday People , the Sun and the Mail were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street.\" When Liz Hodgkinson was at the People we' d have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open the editor drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one.\" Then we' d take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. we' d come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm.\" The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street.\" At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool.\" Liz Hodgkinson was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with an editor.\" an editor asked ' Are Liz Hodgkinson in danger, pet? ' Liz Hodgkinson replied ' Yes, Liz Hodgkinson am '. To which an editor replied ' Oh, good. '\" But, like so many empires before Fleet Street ' s, Fleet Street' s grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch papers - consisting of the Sun, the now - closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose - built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year - long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings most national newspapers left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury' s supermarkets, for example, and the\" Stab in the Back\" is a Pizza Express. Now a part of Fleet Street' s own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached this infamous era of British history final deadline.\" As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites Mr Smith,\" says Mr Smith.\" It makes Mr Smith smile, when Mr Smith think of how Mr Smith now have that place in history.\"",

Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. University of Edinburgh researchers found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than Poorer young people better - off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. University of Edinburgh researchers found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. were was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh' s School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4, 300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in 4 , 300 young people in Edinburgh behaviour and lifestyles. the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime , by the University of Edinburgh ' s School of Law has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said:\" Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty.\" As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network ( AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh' s Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20 % of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20 % of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said:\" The findings are important as The findings suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and tends has not changed despite crime being at crime lowest level for decades.\" tends raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\" A Scottish government spokesman said:\" Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41 - year low, homicide figures at homicide figures lowest level in 39 years and 1, 000 extra officers on our streets.\" The Scottish government has a long - standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and the Scottish government are tackling poverty and inequalities head - on through a number of initiatives including a Â £ 296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government' s welfare cuts.\"",

        "document": "this exercise is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters own patrols in these very same waters. this exercise has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain' s own defences. For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U - boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves. U33' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf and U33 ' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships. U33 ' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew , who live in cramped conditions task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When U33 ' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew , who live in cramped conditions dive the only visible sign of U33 ' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew , who live in cramped conditions presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares Rear Admiral Brad Williamson fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. Rear Admiral Brad Williamson says this exercise is important training and that Rear Admiral Brad Williamson crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. Rear Admiral Brad Williamson says the training\" focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it' s not theoretical that the guys in combat might have to do anti - submarine warfare\". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg' s anti - submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. Lieutenant Colin Ryan , Vicksburg ' s anti - submarine warfare officer says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether submarines have been Russian, Lieutenant Colin Ryan , Vicksburg ' s anti - submarine warfare officer replies nervously:\" Lieutenant Colin Ryan , Vicksburg ' s anti - submarine warfare officer wouldn' t want to comment on that,\" before adding:\" In general, they' re always on the lookout.\" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of Nato members own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia' s increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting many European nations defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what Russia claims is the\" quietest submarine in the world\". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says Russia now leads the world in submarine development. Peter Roberts , a former Royal Navy officer , and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI describes them as technologically advanced and them crews as highly skilled. them are, Peter Roberts , a former Royal Navy officer , and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI says, the\" quietest and most challenging adversary in the world\". When out on patrol them can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of them presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. them lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and\" fingerprinting\" other nations ' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named\" Dynamic Mongoose\", as well as the warships there are anti - submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist - in - charge at Nato' s Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on the underwater robots , which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. the underwater robots , which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm' s way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation' s armoury to conduct anti - submarine warfare is the long - range maritime patrol aircraft. the long - range maritime patrol aircraft are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of the UK ' s own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK' s defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on the UK ' s Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain' s waters. RUSI' s Mr Roberts says a significant gap in the UK ' s defences is a\" key vulnerability\". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as the nuclear deterrent leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, He says, should be\" exceptionally worried\" that the UK is seen as a\" soft touch\", because Russia will continue to test the UK defences, just as Russia have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti - submarine warfare. But this exercise is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do anti - submarine warfare alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government' s forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",

        "document": "United Nations officials rarely use the words\" genocide\" and\" ethnic cleansing,\" but United Nations officials now say potentially both could envelop the world' s youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340, 000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200, 000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2, 500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what another 2 , 500 South Sudanese escaped and what another 2 , 500 South Sudanese saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time Nelson Ladu Thomas crossed was with Nelson Ladu Thomas immediate family; the second - a day later - was with Nelson Ladu Thomas brother' s wife and his brother ' s wife five children who Nelson Ladu Thomas had gone back to help. Six - year - old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where his brother ' s wife and her five children who he had gone back to help possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked Six - year - old Moriswani what his brother ' s wife and her five children who he had gone back to help had left behind.\" They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, They are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,\" Mr Thomas told I. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun.\" They don' t want us,\" Nelson Ladu Thomas said, and gave Nelson Ladu Thomas explanation of why Nelson Ladu Thomas town of Yei, just 80km ( 50 miles) from the border, had become a place Nelson Ladu Thomas had to leave.\" These tribes of Dinka, These tribes of Dinka don' t want Equatorians, These tribes of Dinka don' t want … Nuer. These tribes of Dinka don' t want Nuer.\" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice - President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to Equatorians part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how Otima Amos , 21 had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among 16 other people - most children , and among them two - year - old twins two - year - old twins. \" We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,\" he said.\" walked was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.\" We were afraid We would be caught as We tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with Faida Sarah children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason Faida Sarah left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to Faida Sarah home, demanded car keys from Faida Sarah husband and then hacked her husband to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now Bidi Bidi is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with Uganda generous approach.\" This has been unrelenting since July,\" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR' s senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda.\" The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop This, as This' s a massacre of civilians from both sides.\" Nasir Abel Fernandes , the UNHCR ' s senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as water has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit.

Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. the virtual warriors hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present All three as independent activists, separate from other, government - sponsored groups. The most prominent pro - Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev - based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, Kiev - based programmer Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia' s Rostov region - bordering Ukraine' s eastern separatist regions.\" Kiev - based programmer Yevhen Dokukin gave all this data to Ukraine' s security service, but Ukraine ' s security services still can' t get round to analysing the data, so do analysing yourselves,\" Kiev - based programmer Yevhen Dokukin urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial - of - service ( DDoS) attack.\" DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops ' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded Scores of rebel websites with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, the Ukrainian Cyber Troops , led by Kiev - based programmer Yevhen Dokukin target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel - held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor rebel - held areas of eastern Ukraine for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro - Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine' s security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny used.\" Ukraine ' s security services only use data obtained by people Ukraine ' s security services trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti - Western group which takes Cyber Berkut , a staunchly anti - Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group' s declared goal is thwarting Ukraine' s military plans and thus stopping the\" genocide\" that Cyber Berkut , a staunchly anti - Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych accuses Kiev of unleashing at America' s behest. Cyber Berkut , a staunchly anti - Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych motto is\" Cyber Berkut , a staunchly anti - Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych won' t forgive or forget\", and Cyber Berkut , a staunchly anti - Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice - President Joe Biden' s visit to Kiev on 20 - 21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on several Ukrainian government websites front pages which read:\" Joseph Biden is the fascists ' master.\" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden' s team while Mr Biden ' s team was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington' s military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists\" war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. Cyber Berkut also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote - counting systems ahead of October' s parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko' s website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that Ukrainian officials forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made Russian activist group Anonymous International name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. Russian activist group Anonymous International is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as\" Humpty Dumpty\". What is not clear is whether Russian activist group Anonymous International obtains material through hacking or are given material by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia' s domestic affairs, but some of Russian activist group Anonymous International material covers Ukraine. In November Russian activist group Anonymous International published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May Russian activist group Anonymous International made headlines leaking what Russian activist group Anonymous International said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

Ms Marwick, Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May.

Mr Salmond , who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget said both the country and parliament were on a journey, and added:\" Yes both the country and parliament are a country of different views, but both the country and parliament are not divided.

Ms Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for Mr Salmond , who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that Mr Salmond , who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget had\" served the parliament and Scotland with distinction\". The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since Holyrood was established in 1999. Mr McNeil used veteran Labour MSP Duncan McNeil address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system. Mr McNeil said:\" It will be this parliament' s responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary.\" Holyrood must ensure Holyrood are capable of meeting that challenge, or Holyrood will face the consequences.\" Mr McNeil recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster. But Mr McNeil said:\" It saddens Mr McNeil to say Holyrood now have to do a bit of learning from them and how them run them business.\" Former Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood.

Meanwhile, women' s equality campaigners said Matching Models in London ads were\" straight out of the 1970s\". Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said:\" It is extraordinary that Matching Models in London are taking this approach and almost certainly falls foul of equality legislation.\" If we ever wonder why the battle for gender equality hasn' t been won, this is a timely reminder.\" The agency' s founder Nathalie Jansen said:\" Our clients are important to Matching Models in London - and looks are important.\" Another job advert on the agency' s website asks a\" sexy female driver\" to drive a Porsche Cayenne two days a week for between £ 40, 000 and £ 50, 000 - a - year for a Knightsbridge - based businessman and polo team owner.

Chinese shares fell by nearly 8 % after a week of volatile trading that spread fear to global markets. The Tianjin explosions killed 150 people - with 23 still missing. A total of 367 people remain in hospital after the 12 August blast at a warehouse where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored. Twenty are in critical condition, according to Xinhua. Separately, the UK' s Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel Chinese leaders mishandled Chinese leaders stock market rescue efforts. The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of\" destabilising the market\". Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours. The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to a man death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1, 300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said. The news agency said\" seditious rumours about China' s upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II\" were also among the offences. A journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials, according to a Xinhua report. The journalist, Wang Xiaolu, is accused of\" spreading fake information\" about the market slump, the report said. The state news agency said Mr Wang confessed that The journalist , Wang Xiaolu\" wrote fake report on Chinese stock market based on hearsay and The journalist , Wang Xiaolu own subjective guesses without conducting due verifications\". In 2013 Chinese authorities introduced a possible three - year sentence for spreading rumours - the sentence was supposed to apply to anyone who posted a rumour that was reposted 500 times or viewed 5, 000 times.

The lower house of parliament gave final approval to the bill by 334 votes to 61. The proportional election system awards 340 out of 630 seats to any party that wins more than 40 % of the national vote.

        "document": "The regulator, NHS Improvement, said The regulator , NHS Improvement wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in the NHS efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £ 3. 6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants £ 3 . 6bn brought down by £ 1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £ 600m, the regulator said. A cap means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55 % above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce hospitals reliance on agency staff. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when the NHS buys Agency staff in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was\" promising\", but the progress being made still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10 % down on where NHS trusts wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS\" bank\" staff - effectively the health service' s in - house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said The regulator , NHS Improvement would start publishing\" league tables\" of the best and worst - performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest - earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. The regulator , NHS Improvement found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £ 130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £ 76, while another was quoted £ 70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £ 35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said:\" The NHS simply doesn' t have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There' s much more to be done.\"",

Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference ( WRC), organised by the UN' s International Telecommunication Union ( ITU).

Hungary' s Higher Education Law, signed in April, could force the closure of the Budapest - based CEU, which ranks among the top 200 universities in the world in eight disciplines. Meanwhile, draft legislation on NGOs is expected to go before parliament soon. Human rights groups say draft legislation on NGOs would stigmatise NGOs as\" foreign - backed\" organisations. Last month, the deputy head of the bloc' s executive Commission, Frans Timmermans, warned action would be taken in coming weeks if there were no positive developments.

Britain is currently the world' s third largest importer of wood. Ministers said Ministers were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16, 000 hectares - or 40, 000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re - planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, the timber industry is estimated to be worth more than Â £ 450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. The Welsh government points to The Welsh government Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland.

The US National Security Agency ( NSA) was last year accused of bugging the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel as part of a huge surveillance programme. The scale of the agency' s global spy programme was revealed in documents leaked last year by a former intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden. The revelations about the NSA put a strain on ties between Germany and the US and raised feeling in Germany against American surveillance. The BBC' s Steve Evans in Berlin says the new allegation of American spying on an ally may make it harder for the US to get German help in the US efforts to oppose Russian activity in Ukraine, and also to control Iranian nuclear ambitions. German media say the man arrested this week is a 31 - year - old employee of the federal service, the BND or Bundesnachrichtendienst. The German federal prosecutor' s office confirmed the man' s arrest, but gave no other details.

Within this rapidly growing accumulation, My often come across labels and subjects that My get curious about and that is how My collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled\" Matchbox Labels And The Stories Matchbox Labels Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. My exhibited 5, 000 labels from My collection of 25, 000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. AE Matcheswala set up AE Matcheswala factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat ( also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported AE Matcheswala matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and Very few Wimco labels did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of Wimco common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi ( self - reliance) movement during the partition of India' s Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to Most firms brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India' s struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It' s believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.",

From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales. But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months. This deferral period has been left in place because there is a\" window period\" after infection with blood - borne viruses where blood - borne viruses are not detectable. This window period is far less than 12 months. The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs ( SaBTO) says that for HIV a \" window period \" after infection with blood - borne viruses where they are not detectable varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test. For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, a \" window period \" after infection with blood - borne viruses where they are not detectable is 66 days. In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would - be donor is heterosexual or gay. In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner. By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men. Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long. Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill.\" To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if any man who has had sex with another man in the last year has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence.\" But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said:\" The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on sexually active gay men heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood - borne viruses.\" A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV / Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute. NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate. The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors. If you want more detail about the reasoning behind the decision to lift the ban, then the full report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs ( SaBTO) can be read here.",

A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said the council tax had built - in problems\" from day one\" but a failure to modify the current council tax had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. Prof Kenneth Gibb , from the University of Glasgow found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a\" good tax\" because a tax on property was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But a tax on property also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether a tax on property was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt a tax on property was unfair because a tax on property was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But Prof Kenneth Gibb , from the University of Glasgow found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because such a system meant local authorities income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. Prof Kenneth Gibb , from the University of Glasgow said:\" It is clear there is no magic bullet.\" Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\" So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing the cross - party Commission on Local Tax Reform report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system\" as a whole to be unfair\". A Scottish government spokesman added:\" consider is why, along with our local government partners, the Scottish government have established the cross - party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.\" The Scottish government awaits the commission' s report, which is due in the Autumn.\"",

Glasgow City Council said the implementation of cameras had been explored but the topography of the site made the implementation of cameras difficult. The Glasgow Necropolis is a historic cemetery and tourist attraction. The 37 - acre Victorian cemetery, east of the city centre, contains about 3, 500 monuments and sculptures. Ch Insp Pettigrew, the officer in charge of the Necropolis area, told the BBC:\" At this time of year, it is not the same as the spring and summer months. the Necropolis area is an area where people come to drink. people do that because the Necropolis area is out the way.\" that brings with that anti - social behaviours and disorder, whether deliberate or otherwise. that damages the headstones as well, so there is a clearly a disrespectful aspect to that. The headstones have been here for hundreds of years and can be loose, and if the headstones fall over the headstones can cause serious injury.\" Primarily, we are talking about drinking in the Necropolis. Gang activity in the east end in general is very much in the decline in recent years.\" Ch Insp Pettigrew said police officers take part in regular patrols of the necropolis during the spring and summer months, supported by teams from Community Safety Glasgow, who work in close consultation with the city council. The senior officer said the teams from Community Safety sometimes patrol the area with mobile CCTV vans but Ch Insp Pettigrew , the officer in charge of the Necropolis area would like to see patrol taken a step further. Ch Insp Pettigrew , the officer in charge of the Necropolis area added:\" CCTV has proven to be an effective aide to policing in many other parts of the city, so Ch Insp Pettigrew , the officer in charge of the Necropolis area think it would go without saying that CCTV would be a benefit to this area also.\" The cameras the cameras act as a deterrent because when people know people are here, people clearly don' t have the same advantage as being able to hide behind a bush or a tree, but in the event that something happens it gives us the opportunity to find the people responsible. Quite clearly, us cannot be here 24 hours a day.\" Police Scotland told the BBC Police Scotland only received six reports of crime at the necropolis between April and August 2015 - four of vandalism, one breach of the peace and once incidence of drinking in a public place. Three people were reported to the procurator fiscal over these incidents. The Friends of Glasgow Necropolis are a group of volunteers who conduct tours of the cemetery, and raise money for conservation and restoration work at the Necropolis. Ruth Johnston, the group' s chairwoman, said:\" Ruth Johnston , the group ' s chairwoman don' t think it ( anti - social behaviour at the Necropolis) is any different from a large park in a very large city. We bring a lot of tourists here.\" People feel very safe coming in here, and there wouldn' t be so many people coming if so many people didn' t feel safe.\" The Glasgow Necropolis is incredibly inspiring, no matter what your interests are - history, social history, archaeology, architecture, sculpture. Some of the most famous sculptors have done work here.\" Alexander\" Greek\" Thomson and Charles Rennie Mackintosh are among those whose work is at the Necropolis, while William Miller - the man who wrote the Wee Willie Winkie nursery rhyme - is also buried there. A memorial for Glasgow firefighters is one of 3, 500 in the cemetery, with an estimated 50, 000 people buried at the site in total. Next year, the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis hopes to raise Â £ 60, 000 for the restoration of the Monteith mausoleum, and the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis will continue commemorations for those who died in World War One and other conflicts.

Foot patrols are also carried out within the Necropolis to deter dog fouling.\" There are also quarterly meetings between Police Scotland, the council, Community Safety Glasgow and the Friends of the Necropolis group to discuss any issues.\" The possibility of using re - deployable CCTV in the Necropolis was also explored, but the topography of the site made using difficult in terms of radio signalling.\" A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotland, which is a statutory consultee for the Glasgow Necropolis, added:\" Historic Environment Scotland , which is a statutory consultee for the Glasgow Necropolis are aware that there has been an issue with vandalism and anti - social behaviour at Glasgow Necropolis.\" Whilst Historic Environment Scotland , which is a statutory consultee for the Glasgow Necropolis are not aware of any recent requests to Glasgow City Council planning department regarding the potential installation of CCTV Historic Environment Scotland , which is a statutory consultee for the Glasgow Necropolis would be happy to discuss the potential installation of CCTV and other proposals for improving security within the grounds of the Necropolis with Glasgow City Council planning department.\" Public security measures such as CCTV are not uncommon practice within other historic sites and buildings and Historic Environment Scotland , which is a statutory consultee for the Glasgow Necropolis would work with the applicant to discuss possible options.\"",

The move comes as the personal details of more than 45 million Chinese people were stolen in separate attacks. The government is investigating the thefts and said that the wave of attacks\" threatened internet safety\". The 10 biggest search engines in China have signed up to the anti - phishing scheme to ensure that users looking for bank websites go to the right place. Phishing attacks involve messages that look like messages that look like they come from a bank or other organisation come from a bank or other organisation and direct people to a website that mimics the real thing. When people visit the fake site and enter people login details their login details are recorded by cyber criminals who may loot the account soon afterwards. By ensuring that the websites of banks appear first, the government hopes to limit the numbers of people falling for phishing scams and visiting the fake sites. Some of the search engines will put a special icon next to the bank links in lists of results to flag the bank links as legitimate. The anti - phishing initiative comes at the end of a week in which the personal details of almost 10 % of China' s 485 million web users were stolen. On Christmas day, the hugely popular Tianya chat site revealed that the login names and passwords from 40 million of the hugely popular Tianya chat site users had been stolen.

Some of the actors were warned that Some of the actors wouldn' t be able to shake off Some of the actors sulky, angry, teen characters. But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O ' Connell for example, people in the TV industry who thought the cast would struggle to find work once their time on the show was up couldn' t have been more wrong. Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest - serving members of the cast, appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem. Kaya Scodelario went on to appear in sci - fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp. Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience. Nicholas Hoult' d starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002. Nicholas Hoult has since gone on to play Beast in the X - Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals. Dev Patel' s first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two, took Dev Patel ' s from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire. Dev Patel ' s told Newsbeat, Dev Patel ' s never would have got that role without Skins.\" Dev Patel ' s career started off because Danny Boyle' s daughter was a fan of the show, was is how Dev Patel ' s got an audition for Slumdog.\" Dev Patel ' s has two films out in cinemas at the moment, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Jack O ' Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand - picked by Angelina Jolie to star in Angelina Jolie most recent movie Unbroken. The 24 - year - old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year' s Baftas. Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively. It is, of course, not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films. What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel. So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors? Co - creator Bryan Elsley told Newsbeat the makers of Skins made a conscious decision to hold open auditions.\" There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion the makers of Skins decided to go a different way,\" Co - creator Bryan Elsley explained.\" the makers of Skins felt if the makers of Skins had young people playing characters the same age as young people, and those actors weren' t too trained, it would have a more natural feel.\" It sounds quite risky, but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with, they were able to take that approach. Jack O ' Connell credits the whole team for the actors ' future success.\" Jack O ' Connell think the whole team knew if the whole team were going to identify that genre, that era, that generation, the whole team needed people on the ground level,\" Jack O ' Connell said.\" A writing team that understood, the whole team got that right first and then Jack O ' Connell guess the whole team chose to cast exciting people.\" Jack O ' Connell feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but Jack O ' Connell don' t think it was a coincidence that the cast came through there.\" Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and Piers Wenger thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch the cast that helped nurture the cast talent.\" the cast had the opportunity to do properly complex [ roles], rather than just two dimensional ones,\" Piers Wenger said.\" It is extraordinary, in the past soap operas had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do young people first job.\" That would have been your only break, but time' s are changing.\" Piers Wenger think thanks to shows like Skins, unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common.\" Follow @ BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube.",

The data, from 32 mental health trusts, shows average number of\" bed days\" per patient per year has fallen by 10 %. Healthwatch England says some patients are being discharged too early and without enough support. Anna Bradley, chairwoman of Healthwatch England, said the findings reflect a troubling picture where patients discharged from hospital often struggle to access crisis treatment at home.\" What is particularly problematic is when people leave institutions, people cannot access the support people need in the community. Healthwatch England have heard of cases where people have taken people own lives. Our concern is that people are being lost between hospitals and community services.\" Latest statistics show that in recent years, the number of suicides of patients being cared for at home has been double that of inpatients. Prof Louis Appleby, chairman of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy advisory group, says the numbers represent a change in the nature of acute psychiatric care, with treatment increasingly being provided outside hospitals. While many patients prefer care at home, care at home can also represent a risk.\" The ideological drive towards services in the community and away from beds, can go too far. Eventually that drive crosses a line - and that line is safety. If you combine the ideological drive with pressure on resources, you have a toxic combination,\" Prof Louis Appleby , chairman of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy advisory group said.

A new\" UK settled status\" will grant those who have spent five years in the UK equal rights on healthcare, education, benefits and pensions. Guaranteeing EU citizens ' rights is the top priority for the EU delegation negotiating Brexit. Before Mrs May' s offer, the EU proposed that EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1. 2 million Britons living in EU countries should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice ( ECJ). There are two other thorny issues that have to be resolved early on - the UK' s divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border. An estimated 3. 2 million EU citizens live in the UK and there is much nervousness - some even fear deportation. Mrs May sought to reassure the UK' s 27 EU partners, saying the UK\" does not want anyone here to have to leave, nor does the UK ' s want families to be split up\". Theresa May Brexit statement took up little of the summit' s time. There was no debate as the EU is anxious to avoid any splits emerging. The UK election left Mrs May seriously weakened, heading a minority government, which has fuelled uncertainty about the whole Brexit process. The UK' s exit deadline is 30 March 2019. A cut - off date for obtaining\" UK settled status\" is yet to be announced. EU citizens who settle in the UK before Brexit will get a grace period to reach the five - year minimum for residency - but only if EU citizens who settle in the UK before Brexit arrive before the cut - off date. There are categories of people whose status may remain unclear, such as children, carers, students and Irish citizens. Ireland has a special relationship with the UK, including a Common Travel Area. The UK is anxious to start negotiating a new trade deal soon, but the EU has already won the argument that the EU Brexit priorities must be addressed first. As the summit got under way, European Council President Donald Tusk emphasised that the door to the UK staying in the EU was still open. Quoting John Lennon' s Imagine, European Council President Donald Tusk said:\" You may say I' m a dreamer, but I' m not the only one.\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that as an Anglophile,\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte hate Brexit from every angle.\"\" It is crucially important we know what Britain wants from Brexit,\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned. The Netherlands is one of the UK' s closest EU allies, with a similar stance on free trade. Mrs May has vowed to take the UK out of both the EU single market and the customs union. But there are many voices - including in Mrs May Conservative Party - pressing for a softer approach.\" Mr Rutte hope we' ll come to some form of continued [ UK] membership or relationship with the internal market,\" Mr Rutte said.\" Mr Rutte absolutely believe the UK will be hit in the economy and the pound very hard.\" Counter - terrorism has also been a key issue at the summit which comes in the wake of an attack in Brussels on Tuesday. Several EU states have been attacked in recent weeks, including the UK, France and Sweden, and Mrs May said that an attack against any member state was an attack on all. The 28 leaders agreed to put legal pressure on internet giants like Google, Twitter and Facebook to remove jihadist content faster and more proactively. Mr Tusk said the bloc was calling on social media companies to do whatever was necessary to prevent the spread of terrorist material and was prepared to pass new legislation.\" prevent means developing new tools to detect and remove material automatically,\" Mr Tusk said. The EU wants the industry to help tackle the problem of attackers slipping under the radar by using apps with end - to - end encryption.",

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The Uzbek government announced President Karimov death on Friday after a period of rumours about President Karimov ill health. As is often the case with strongman regimes, no tried and tested succession mechanism is in place in Uzbekistan, and the transition of power may well be a complicated process. Uzbekistan is the most populous Central Asian country and has the largest army. Mr Karimov, who came to power during the Soviet era, has led the country since independence in 1991. During President Karimov long rule, President Karimov has built a relatively stable secular regime in a region threatened by Islamist radicalism. But many believe built has been done at the expense of human rights, and has often been an excuse to hound legitimate opposition. built also has not completely eradicated the long - term risk posed by Islamist militancy. Many Uzbek Islamists have simply dodged the tight security at home by fighting for the Islamic State group abroad, but should the secular government weaken, Many Uzbek Islamists might be tempted to come back. Some also say that Uzbekistan' s fractured and exiled opposition may turn to Islamism to boost Uzbekistan ' s fractured and exiled opposition appeal in the majority Muslim country. Positioned on the ancient Great Silk Road between Europe and Asia, Uzbekistan enjoys a strategic location that has attracted the interest of many foreign states throughout Uzbekistan ' s long history. Most recently, a strategic location that has attracted the interest of many foreign states throughout its long history has been one reason why Russia and Western powers have been vying for a foothold. In 2001, Uzbekistan allowed the US to use Uzbekistan ' s air bases in support of military action in Afghanistan, but four years later all foreign troops were evicted following Washington' s criticism of the Uzbek government' s human rights record. Moscow will be keen to ensure that Mr Karimov' s successor leans towards Russia rather than the West. So far, unlike most Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan has been wary of Russian influence. In 2012, Uzbekistan ' s withdrew from the main Russia - led regional military bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Political instability caused by Mr Karimov' s demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan' s borders. The country is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold, and any turbulence may push up the price of these commodities on world markets. Tension could could also spill over into Uzbekistan' s energy - rich neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Regional transport corridors may be disrupted, including gas and oil pipelines running to Russia and China. Uzbekistan also supplies electricity to Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and southern Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan lies on key opium routes from Afghanistan to Russia and on to Europe, and drug smugglers could take advantage of instability to distract or disrupt law - enforcement efforts. President Karimov has never been shy of deploying President Karimov ' s powerful security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power. deploying, among other things, has enabled President Karimov ' s to maintain a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country. Should a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country be upset, the ripple effect may be felt as far away as in China. Uzbekistan hosts a sizeable Uighur community, and the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China has long been seen as a source of concern by Beijing. President Karimov' s successor will also inherit unresolved border differences with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

It was only afterwards that we all realised how serious it was.\" Jason Ip, a food vendor, said there was\" chaos\" as people waited for the emergency services to arrive.\" A few people started running towards the stage.

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The reconstruction of the event 66 million years ago was made possible by drilling into the remnant bowl and analysing the so - called Chicxulub Crater , now buried under ocean sediments off Mexico ' s Yucatan Peninsula rocks. its rocks show how the space impactor made the hard surface of the planet slosh back and forth like a fluid. At one stage, a mountain higher than Everest was thrown up before collapsing back into a smaller range of peaks.\" And this all happens on the scale of minutes, which is quite amazing,\" Prof Joanna Morgan from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News. The researchers report the team account in this week' s edition of Science Magazine. the team study confirms a very dynamic, very energetic model for crater formation, and will go a long way to explaining the resulting cataclysmic environmental changes. The debris thrown into the atmosphere likely saw the skies darken and the global climate cool for months, perhaps even years, driving many creatures into extinction, not just the dinosaurs. The team spent April to May this year drilling a core through the so - called Chicxulub Crater, now buried under ocean sediments off Mexico' s Yucatan Peninsula. Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth. The researchers targeted a particular zone in the 200km - wide bowl known as the\" peak ring\", which - if earlier ideas were correct - should have contained the rocks that moved the greatest distance in the impact. the rocks that moved the greatest distance in the impact would have been dense granites lifted from almost 10km down. And been is precisely what the team found.\" Once the team got through the impact melt on top, the team recovered pink granite. the rock ' s was so obvious to the eye - like what you would expect to see in a kitchen countertop,\" recalled Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US. But the rock ' s were not normal granites, of course. the rock ' s were deformed and fractured at every scale - visibly in the hand and even down at the level of the rock' s individual mineral crystals. Evidence of enormous stress, of having experienced colossal pressures. The analysis of the core materials now fits an astonishing narrative. an astonishing narrative describes the roughly 15km - wide stony asteroid instantly punching a cavity in the Earth' s surface some 30km deep and 80 - 100km across. Unstable, and under the pull of gravity, the sides of this depression promptly started to collapse inwards. At the same time, the centre of the bowl rebounded, briefly lifting rock higher than the Himalayas, before also falling down to cover the inward - rushing sides of the initial hole. \" If this deep - rebound model is correct ( this deep - rebound model' s called the dynamic collapse model), then our peak ring rocks should be the rocks that have travelled farthest in the impact - first, outwards by kilometres, then up in the air by over 10km, and back down and outwards by another, say, 10km. So our peak ring rocks total travel path is something like 30km, and our peak ring rocks do their total travel path in under 10 minutes,\" Prof Gulick told the BBC' s Science in Action programme. Imagine a sugar cube dropped into a cup of tea. The drink' s liquid first gets out of the way of the cube, moves back in and up, before finally slopping down. When the asteroid struck the Earth, the rocks the asteroid hit also behaved like a fluid.\" These rocks must have lost the rocks it hit strength and cohesion, and very dramatically had the rocks it hit friction reduced,\" said Prof Morgan.\" So, yes, temporarily, the rocks it hit behave like a fluid. behave' s the only way you can make a crater like Chicxulub.\" One of the important outcomes of the research is that the research provides a useful template also to understand the surfaces of other planets. All the terrestrial worlds and even Earth' s Moon are scarred with craters just like Chicxulub. And knowing how rocks can move vertically and horizontally in an impact will assist scientists as scientists attempt to interpret similar crustal features seen elsewhere in the Solar System. The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling ( ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program ( IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program ( ICDP). Jonathan. Amos - INTERNET @ bbc. co. uk and follow Jonathan .

In 2013, the Italian composer was reported as saying Morricone wouldn' t work with Tarantino because Quentin Tarantino ' s\" places music in Quentin Tarantino ' s films without coherence\". But the 87 - year - old told the BBC Morricone had no issues with how the director incorporated Morricone older works into films like Kill Bill and Django Unchained.\" On the contrary, Morricone was very, very flattered,\" Morricone said.\" The fact that Morricone music, which had been written for other films, could be adapted to the poetry of Quentin Tarantino' s film - making was a great gift for Morricone.\" The only thing Morricone criticised of Quentin Tarantino was a single scene in a single movie which, for Morricone, was too violent and too ghastly. Morricone couldn' t watch a single scene in a single movie which , for me , was too violent and too ghastly.\" Speaking through an interpreter, the maestro said Morricone original comments had been mis - reported, adding:\" People should pay a lot of attention when People write something down.\" The pair have now collaborated for the first time, with the Italian maestro penning the soundtrack for Tarantino' s upcoming film The Hateful Eight. the soundtrack for Tarantino ' s upcoming film The Hateful Eight marks the first time the composer has scored a Western since Morricone career - defining work with Sergio Leone on films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and Once Upon a Time in the West. the soundtrack for Tarantino ' s upcoming film The Hateful Eight is also a first for Tarantino - who has never commissioned a full orchestral score for one of Quentin Tarantino ' s films before, preferring to rely on old soundtracks and classic pop records. Morricone says it was Tarantino' s dense script that persuaded Morricone to work on the project.\" Tarantino ' s dense script was this thick,\" Morricone says, indicating a document several times thicker than War and Peace.\" Quentin Tarantino ' s actually came to Rome just to convince Morricone, to Morricone house.\" It was very easy for Morricone to say yes because the script was very, very relevant and interesting and full of detail.\" The Hateful Eight, which is released in January, reunites Tarantino with several of Quentin Tarantino ' s regular players - Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern - as well as newcomers Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir and Channing Tatum. Set roughly a decade after the US Civil War, The Hateful Eight , which is released in January finds an eclectic group of law - keepers, outlaws, mercenaries, bounty hunters and fugitives trapped in a stagecoach waypoint by a massive snowstorm. As the plot unfurls, an eclectic group of law - keepers , outlaws , mercenaries , bounty hunters and fugitives begin to wonder whether an eclectic group of law - keepers , outlaws , mercenaries , bounty hunters and fugitives' ll make it out alive. The score' s key movement is a seven - minute suite called L ' Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud.\" The main instruments introducing this piece are the bassoon, the contra - bassoon and the tuba,\" Morricone says.\" And are is very strange because Morricone have never done are in the past.\" The sound these instruments produce can express the drama, the rage, the despair and the irony that are the main themes of Tarantino' s story. The sound these instruments produce are a healthy, bodily sound. The sound these instruments produce also express a criticism towards the leading characters of the film.\" A sinister, brooding passage of music, a seven - minute suite called L ' Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud will form the centrepiece of the composer' s world tour next year, celebrating Morricone 60 years in the film industry. Despite Morricone age - and the lingering pain from a back injury Morricone sustained last year - Morricone says Morricone is\" looking forward\" to the concerts, and finds playing themes from films such as The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and A Fistful of Dollars an\" incredibly gratifying experience\". The composer has scored more than 500 films, sold more than 70 million albums, scored a top 10 single in the UK ( with Chi Mai in 1982) and received an honorary Oscar - but Morricone has no intention of resting on Morricone laurels.\" Morricone' ve been working for many years and the sum of all these experiences led Morricone always to improve, to do better,\" Morricone says.\" Every piece of work Morricone do adds something to Morricone experience and Morricone style, and brings something new.\" And had Morricone been able to stomach the violence in Tarantino' s latest movie?\" The fact Morricone don' t like those sequences is not a problem. It' s a question of Morricone personal sensitivity,\" Morricone says.\" Morricone would go to the extent to say that maybe Tarantino ' s can afford to include those violent sequences because the violence in Tarantino ' s latest movie' s part of Tarantino ' s poetry.\" The world can be a very cruel place and Tarantino ' s has a wonderful way of describing this cruelty.\" The Hateful Eight is out in the UK on 8 January.

Campaigners say approval would set a\" dangerous precedent\". But the company says Third Energy operations are no risk to people or the environment. Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into rocks deep underground to unlock trapped gas. The process was banned in 2011 after the shale gas firm Cuadrilla caused minor earth tremors when the shale gas firm Cuadrilla fracked a well in Lancashire. Third Energy has licences to produce gas in North Yorkshire and offshore in the North Sea. In 2013 Third Energy drilled an exploratory well near the village of Kirby Misperton, close to the North York Moors National Park. Third Energy now wants to frack the well to test whether Third Energy can unlock shale gas from rocks up to 10, 000ft ( 3, 000m) underground.\" All Third Energy want to do is test whether gas will flow from an existing well using hydraulic fracturing,\" says Rasik Valand, chief executive of Third Energy.\" What Third Energy are planning is safe. There is no risk to the environment or the public.\" But there has been strong opposition to the plan from the local community and environmentalists. Hundreds of anti - fracking protesters are expected to gather outside the council meeting in Northallerton on Friday. The council has received more than 4, 000 representations, the vast majority against the proposal. Green campaigners fear that approval here would open the door for fracking elsewhere.\" plans by Third Energy to frack a well at a site near the village of Kirby Misperton in the district of Ryedale risks setting a dangerous precedent for Britain,\" says Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth.\" Friends of the Earth strongly urge councillors to reject this planning application which is clearly deeply unpopular with the local community.\" Others are concerned about the impact on the local economy as Kirby Misperton is also home to Flamingo Land, one of Yorkshire' s top tourists attractions.\" This place is beautiful,\" says retired bishop, the Right Reverend Graham Cray, who lives in the village.\" The economy is based on tourism and agriculture. Tourists don' t come to a gas field and a gas field is what we will turn into if we get the scale of fracking that is intended.\" Last year Lancashire County Council rejected Cuadrilla' s plan to carry out exploratory drilling and fracking at two new sites on the Fylde. A planning inquiry into that application took place earlier this year. A recommendation will be sent in the summer to the communities secretary for a final decision. The Third Energy application involves an existing site that has produced gas since the 1990s. The well has already been drilled. The shale gas produced will also be sent through a network of pipes to a nearby power station. sent will avoid air pollution caused by flaring gas. So the company expects the fracking activity to be completed within eight weeks. The council' s planning officer has recommended that the application be approved. But it is now down to the 11 councillors on the planning committee to take the final decision. That decision may not come until Monday due to the number of people who have registered to speak at the meeting. If approved, fracking could start by the end of the year. The Department of Energy and Climate Change refused to comment on Third Energy' s application ahead of the council meeting. But in a statement The Department of Energy and Climate Change said:\" Shale gas is a fantastic opportunity which will create jobs, boost our economy and strengthen our energy security.\" There is tough regulation in place to ensure that fracking can take place safely - now is the time to start exploration and find out just how much shale gas is there and how much we can get out of the ground.\" You can follow John on Twitter at @ JohnMoylanBBC.",

BBC director general Tony Hall set out plans for the next decade, saying the corporation will become an\" open BBC for the internet age\". A children' s iPlayer and a pool of local reporters who will share work with local newspapers are also planned. Yet BBC director general Tony Hall said funding cuts would mean the loss or reduction of some services. Lord Hall laid out the plans at the Science Museum on Monday, ahead of the BBC' s charter renewal in 2016. Citing the importance of\" excellence without arrogance\", BBC director general Tony Hall said BBC director general Tony Hall plans did not signal\" an expansionist BBC\". BBC director general Tony Hall did warn, however, that funding cuts would mean the BBC ' s would\" inevitably have to either close or reduce some services\", without specifying which areas might be under threat. New initiatives will include an Ideas Service, which Lord Hall said would be an\" open online platform\" featuring material from galleries, museums and universities as well as the corporation the BBC ' s. BBC director general Tony Hall said:\" Our new, open BBC will act as a curator bringing the best from Britain' s great cultural institutions and thinkers to everyone.\" Britain has some of the greatest cultural forces in the world. the BBC ' s want to join with some of the greatest cultural forces in the world, working alongside some of the greatest cultural forces in the world, to make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world.\" the BBC ' s are extremely ambitious for this new service.\" Where Google' s mission is to organise the world' s information, ours in a smaller way would be to understand the world ' s information. the BBC ' s will work with anyone who can help the BBC ' s understand this ever more complex world.\" The government launched a consultation on the BBC' s Royal Charter, which sets out the purpose of the BBC and how the BBC ' s will be governed, in July, promising to ask\" hard questions\" about the corporation' s size and ambition. Other BBC plans include:. The director general also said BBC director general Tony Hall wanted to enable\" producers, directors, writers, artists to have the creative freedom to do things producers , directors , writers , artists would find it harder to do elsewhere\". Quality drama will also be a priority, BBC director general Tony Hall said, and the BBC will make\" bigger and bolder series\" that will be made available on the iPlayer in their entirety. Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox also announced a science strand named The New Age of Wonder, which will be part of the Ideas Service and will be created in partnership with organisations like the Royal Institution.\" the BBC ' s is not an expansionist BBC\" is perhaps the key political line in today' s announcements. This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is\" imperial in the BBC ' s ambitions\" made by Chancellor George Osborne ( along with several newspapers). Partnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co - operation rather than competition. The second theme can be seen most clearly in the plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to\" binge\" watch. The BBC is in a global marketplace - Netflix, Amazon, Google, Apple and HBO - the traditional media landscape is being blown apart. The BBC' s problem is looking after the BBC ' s core audience and responding to a technological transformation. It will take money and the BBC has just taken a Â £ 650m cut. Those\" tough choices\" mentioned in the speech is the theme that has not yet been announced. Lord Hall described the recent agreement by the BBC to cover the Â £ 600m cost of providing free television licences for over - 75s as a\" tough deal\" that would require\" some very difficult choices\" to be made. Lord Hall said:\" Having already saved 40 % of the BBC' s revenues in this charter period, the BBC ' s must save close to another 20 % over the next five years.\" Details of how those savings will be made and which services might be under threat will be announced in the coming months, Lord Hall added. In a charter review proposals document published on Monday, however, the BBC suggests that\" some existing services\" might no longer be needed in future.\" Streaming news may replace rolling news,\" the document states.\" Children may prefer iPlay to scheduled television. The Ideas Service might mean the BBC ' s no longer need BBC Four.\" Later in the same document, though, the BBC states\" it is too early to be specific about the service changes that the BBC ' s will need to make.\" The BBC' s plans for\" a network of 100 public service reporters across the country\" did not find favour with the Scottish Newspaper Society, who labelled the proposal\" a Trojan horse which will undermine long - established publications and destroy local news agencies\".\" Instead of helping local news publishers, The BBC ' s plans for \" a network of 100 public service reporters across the country \" would make the BBC even more powerful and would further concentrate coverage of news in the hands of the state - funded broadcaster,\" said the Scottish Newspaper Society , who labelled the proposal \" a Trojan horse which will undermine long - established publications and destroy local news agencies director John McLellan. The News Media Association, which represents national, regional and local news media organisations across the UK, expressed similar concerns, saying the corporation' s proposals represented\" BBC expansion into local news provision and recruitment of more BBC local journalists through the back door\". \" The local newspaper sector already employs thousands of journalists and is the only reliable source of independent and trusted local news across the UK,\" said The local newspaper sector vice chairman Ashley Highfield.\" There is no deficit which the BBC needs to plug.\"\" Under the guise of being helpful, the BBC would end up replacing independent local news services,\" Mr McLellan told Radio 4' s The World at One earlier, calling the plan\" a further expansion of the BBC' s encroachment\".

        "document": "the study found children of minority families do not get enough support to learn Cantonese - putting children of minority families behind in school and causing long - term problems in the jobs market.\" One of the main barriers to equal access has been a de facto racial segregation of ethnic minority students from Chinese students in the public school system,\" says University of Hong Kong law professor, Puja Kapai, who carried out the study. The practice of communities studying separately has also meant that children grow up without interacting with other cultures. Hong Kong is home to 365, 000 ethnic minority people, making up 6 % of Hong Kong total population. Communities of Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese and Filipinos have lived in Hong Kong for generations. But the city still lacks a curriculum for children speaking Chinese as a second language, which would enable children speaking Chinese as a second language to learn Cantonese, a requirement for many jobs and university places.\" The language requirement that forms a barrier for ethnic minorities to receive equal access in education and the labour market, can be seen as an indirect form of discrimination,\" says Raymond Ho, a senior member of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong. But Raymond Ho , a senior member of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong is confident that since the government made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of race in 2009, there is more public awareness of the needs of ethnic minorities. More stories from the BBC' s Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch. In the past there have been claims that Chinese locals are\" less accepting\" of people with darker skin. claims that Chinese locals are \" less accepting \" of people with darker skin was the claim of a report in 2008 from Unison, a group that campaigns for the rights of ethnic minorities. This acceptance level was found to be lowest in the education sector. Language is a major barrier for ethnic minorities to access education. The best place to start learning Chinese and meeting people of other backgrounds is in kindergarten, says Holing Yip from Unison. But Unison' s study Kindergarten Support Report 2015 showed that 62 % of kindergartens used Cantonese exclusively as the interview language. Unison ' s study Kindergarten Support Report 2015 also found that privately - run kindergartens were reluctant to give application forms to non - Chinese parents, and many ask children to have Chinese speaking skills by age three. As a result, there is a concentration of ethnic minorities in a small number of kindergartens. Mr Ho says the Equal Opportunities Commission has been\" encouraging kindergartens to be open to ethnic minorities. But also not to use language ability as a selection criteria\". There has been a pattern of Chinese students enrolling in mainstream primary and secondary schools, where classes are taught in Cantonese. Ethnic minorities would enrol in English - medium\" designated schools\". But the designated schools equipped students with such a low level of Cantonese that students would find it hard to enter university or employment. As such some parents choose to send some parents children to Cantonese - medium schools.\" Having struggled many ethnic minority parents, many ethnic minority parents want many ethnic minority parents children to learn Cantonese so their children don' t go through what many ethnic minority parents did,\" says Ms Yip. But getting information about how to apply to Chinese - medium schools is often only available in Chinese. Some have discouraged ethnic minority parents from applying. Those who get places can struggle, as all classes are in Cantonese with no extra support in class and parents are unable to help at home. Many parents are forced to seek extra tuition to help children with homework.\" There are situations where if a tutor can' t come one day, Many parents children won' t be able to hand in their children homework and will be penalised. It' s also a huge financial burden,\" says Ms Yip. Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani attended both types of schools.\" Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani learnt more Chinese in the mainstream school where all Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani friends were Chinese, just by practising more Chinese outside of class, than Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani did at the designated school where Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani studied Cantonese as a language class.\" After pressure from local non - governmental organisations and the United Nations, the Hong Kong government disbanded designated schools in 2013. But the tendency to send ethnic minority children to particular schools continues.\" Ultimately, parents are faced with the decision of whether parents children should suffer now in a Chinese - medium school, or later in the labour market. And the decision of whether their children should suffer now in a Chinese - medium school , or later in the labour market' s not a fair choice for a parent to have to make,\" says Ms Yip. In September 2014, the Hong Kong government took a step forward by introducing a\" learning framework\" aimed at supporting ethnic minority students in learning Cantonese. Depending on the number of ethnic minority students enrolled, schools can receive from HK $ 800, 000 ( Â £ 68, 000) to HK $ 1, 500, 000 to help ethnic minority students. But Prof Kapai is sceptical about a \" learning framework \" aimed at supporting ethnic minority students in learning Cantonese effectiveness.\" a \" learning framework \" aimed at supporting ethnic minority students in learning Cantonese has simply broken the curriculum down into steps, but nothing has actually changed. There needs to be a Chinese as a second language curriculum to teach non - native speakers how to learn Cantonese properly,\" Prof Kapai ' s says.\" Ethnic minorities may still be struggling with subjects such as maths as a result of the class and material being in Chinese,\" says Unison' s Ms Yip. Prof Kapai' s report emphasises interlinked problems for minority groups. A lack of Cantonese language skills will present barriers in employment, leading to an increase in poverty, and difficulty accessing healthcare. Cantonese language proficiency is a core requirement for some jobs, such as the civil service. Typical occupations taken up by ethnic minorities are in the catering, construction and manual labour industries. The Hong Kong Council of Social Welfare says that many Pakistani, Indonesian and Thai households are below the city' s poverty rate.\" Mr Nebhwani identify as a Hongkonger,\" says Mr Nebhwani. But Mr Nebhwani is excluded from many jobs because of the limitations of Mr Nebhwani language skills.\" If Mr Nebhwani were to try and completely integrate, integrate would be hard because of Mr Nebhwani level of Cantonese.\"\" The government is committed to encouraging and supporting non - Chinese speaking students ' integration into the community, including facilitating non - Chinese speaking students ' early adaptation to the school education system and mastery of the Chinese language,\" said a spokesperson for Hong Kong' s education bureau.",

Former F1 designer Gordon Murray is behind iStream carbon technology to give the new models extra strength. THE HISTORY OF THE TVR. Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent. The automotive industry in Wales already includes 40 component manufacturers and more than 100 other firms in the supply chain. Ford and Toyota have engine plants and Aston Martin recently announced plans to assemble a new model in the Vale of Glamorgan. The Welsh Automotive Forum estimates 18, 000 people work in the sector in Wales, with sales worth Â £ 3. 2bn a year. But the impact of the sector is greater than just the number of people working in The automotive industry in Wales. On the whole The automotive industry in Wales' s an industry that pays well. On top of that The automotive industry in Wales has to be innovative. The automotive industry in Wales is continually having to improve design and models to make vehicles cleaner and more efficient. Component makers also have to keep looking at the way Component makers Component makers work so Component makers keep winning contracts to supply the car makers. As a result, The automotive industry in Wales is an industry that tends to be high on training and big on investment in The automotive industry in Wales people and machines. That means The automotive industry in Wales is of more benefit to the Welsh economy than the same number of workers in other industries. TVR will bring much needed jobs to the Heads of the Valleys and a simplified assembly process, so TVR factory only needs to be 20 % of the size of a conventional plant.

        "document": "That is a harsh reflection on Diego Simeone playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 ( his Atletico Madrid team most recent La Liga triumph). And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game' s hottest managerial properties, with Diego Simeone approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised Diego Simeone playing days. If you asked Diego Simeone how Diego Simeone Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi - finals, where his Atletico Madrid team will face Jose Mourinho' s Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, Diego Simeone would provide you with a simple answer:\" Hard work and humility.\" Indeed, Hard work and humility is exactly the mantra Diego Simeone has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - Diego Simeone steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff. Until recently, most people assumed run would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday' s famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real. To a great extent, Simeone' s assessment of Diego Simeone Atletico team' s greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months Diego Simeone had guided his Atletico Madrid team to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles. The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of his Atletico Madrid team play is unrivalled. The discipline , intensity and sheer , uncompromising effort of their play was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico' s whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes. Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone' s other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico' s bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom ( with the exception of Villa) were superstars before Atletico ' s bunch of largely unheralded journeymen , none of whom ( with the exception of Villa ) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge Atletico ' s bunch of largely unheralded journeymen , none of whom ( with the exception of Villa ) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football. For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game' s tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico' s unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low - budget teams like Atletico simply aren' t supposed to do this well. Yet here Madrid ' s second team are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer. That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico' s current success is simply down to the fact that Madrid ' s second team run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within Madrid ' s second team ranks. That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and Simeone ' s gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos team' s strengths. Under Simeone' s instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon Madrid ' s second team hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter - attack. As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build - up to Simeone ' s team' s latest triumph, Barcelona' s strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico' s lies in controlling space. Simeone' s attention to detail and Simeone ' s ability to clearly communicate Simeone ' s plans ensures that Simeone ' s players have mastered the art of playing the game where his players want to, while simultaneously forcing his players opponents into areas where their opponents feel uncomfortable. More than anything, though, Simeone' s unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico' s image on Atletico ' s image head. For years, Madrid' s second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided Madrid ' s second team as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up. That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked a forlorn young boy frowning father:\" Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are somos Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to\" Accrington Stanley … who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as Atletico fans lurched from disaster to disaster. Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; Madrid ' s second team manager is even an image of vibrant self - belief as Simeone ' s prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging the crowd to applaud the players for the players wholehearted effort. When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching the home fans team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until the home fans heroes re - emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour. As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged Atletico ' s weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by Diego Simeone absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen.

With Red Bull - who are contracted to Renault until 2016 partnership with Renault disintegrating, the team may be forced to switch to Ferrari engines. Mercedes are understood to be against supplying Red Bull - who are contracted to Renault until 2016 - because Mercedes do not want to help a strong rival become more competitive. Media playback is not supported on this device. The German giant is also concerned about what Mercedes and many other F1 insiders perceive to be Red Bull' s history of antagonistic relationships with engine partners. Red Bull' s relationship with Renault has been difficult for some time, and appears to have become untenable in recent months as the team' s frustrations with the lack of competitiveness of the French engine boil over. Honda is the only other manufacturer in F1, but partner McLaren would almost certainly exercise partner McLaren veto over any potential deal with Red Bull, who in any case are not believed to be interested in a deal with the Japanese company at this stage. Renault, which supplies only Red Bull and sister team Toro Rosso in F1, is in the final stages of negotiations to take over the financially troubled Lotus team, although no deal has yet been completed.

Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster said Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster made Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster first statement shortly after the 1989 disaster and was visited by police the following year. While the meeting left Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster\" confused\", Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster agreed to make changes. The officer concerned, former Insp Matthew Sawers, denied asking Mr Bruder to change the sense of Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster statement. Mr Bruder told the inquests into the 96 deaths at the FA Cup semi - final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 that Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster was visited by an inspector from West Midlands Police, who were supplying evidence to the first inquests. Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster said Insp Sawers spent six hours with Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster. When the officer went to the bathroom, Mr Bruder said Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster looked through some of Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster notes.

On one side a sheet of paper divided lengthways in two , with handwritten notes on it said\" first statement\" and on the other side a sheet of paper divided lengthways in two , with handwritten notes on it said\" change to\", Mr Bruder said. During the meeting Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster said Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster was asked to speak over the phone to a pathologist from the coroner' s office. Mr Bruder, who was 22 at the time of the disaster, said Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster conceded\" to the doctor' s medical superiority\" when it was suggested Kevin could not have been alive when Mr Bruder tried to revive 15 - year - old Kevin Williams. Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster agreed to make changes to Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster original statement. Among changes to his original statement Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster accepted Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster may have been mistaken to say Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster had felt\" a faint pulse\" while trying to save Kevin. Mr Bruder told the jury Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster was 100 % confident Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster had felt a pulse and had seen the teenager move while lying on the pitch. The court heard Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster wrote to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2012 to say West Midlands Police had made a\" deliberate attempt\" to make Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster change Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster statement. Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster told the inquests Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster stood by that view and the inspector who visited Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster had not been honest with Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster. Earlier Mr Bruder told the inquests that, along with a St John Ambulance volunteer medic who gave heart massage, Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster had tried to resuscitate Kevin. Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster said Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster was\" absolutely 100 % confident\" Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster felt a pulse in the teenager' s neck, adding:\" a pulse in the teenager ' s neck was not something that would appear to Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster to be absolutely healthy, beating vibrantly, but there was definitely a pulse.\" Asked whether Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster saw any signs of life while giving CPR, Mr Bruder said:\" Well, to Mr Bruder , who was 22 at the time of the disaster 15 - year - old Kevin Williams was alive. There was a faint pulse.\" The jury also heard from two Liverpool fans who tried to help Kevin while Mr Bruder was with 15 - year - old Kevin Williams. One of the group, Stephen Rankin, said Kevin did not show any signs of life. Mr Bruder said a female St John Ambulance medic eventually joined the group, and took over the CPR. After trying to resuscitate Kevin ' s a female St John Ambulance medic said Kevin had died. Mr Sawers, who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police, told the inquests Mr Sawers , who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police had been asked by the original coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, to visit Mr Bruder to get further explanation and detail around evidence, including the convulsions and pulse. Mr Sawers , who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police was to give a summary of the further statement to the inquests the following day, but denied Mr Sawers , who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police had applied pressure on Mr Bruder or had attended with the intention of changing Mr Bruder statement. Mr Sawers said:\" Mr Sawers , who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police did not cause Mr Bruder to change the sense of the statement. What Mr Sawers , who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police did was to go through the details and to elicit more detail and explanation.\" Everything that Mr Sawers , who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police did in Mr Sawers , who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police encounter with PC Bruder was done with integrity and with the best of intentions. It wasn' t something that Mr Sawers , who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police had any personal stake in.\" But Pete Weatherby, representing Kevin' s family, suggested there had been\" a determined effort\" to change Mr Bruder statement which was\" inconvenient to the investigation\". Mr Weatherby said that\" it was very inconvenient that here was a serving police officer giving evidence of vital signs in a casualty that died\". Pete Weatherby , representing Kevin ' s family suggested that as a result of the meeting, Mr Sawers came away with a second statement that\" loosened up\" evidence about Kevin' s vital signs.

The 12ft - high ( 3. 6m) statue features about 40, 000 spoons and has taken almost five months to build at the British Ironworks Centre in Oswestry. The spoons have been donated from across the world, as well as local schoolchildren. the statue is due to be transported to Mr Geller' s home in Berkshire on 28 May. It was hoped the statue could be transported to Berkshire by helicopter, but after safety fears, the Ironworks Centre said the TV production company behind Shipping Wars had stepped forward to help. By Bethan BellBBC News. About 250 people toasted the unveiling of the gorilla statue in a sunny Oswestry. The British Ironworks Centre had long kept the project under wraps so there was a palpable sense of intrigue and anticipation about what a 12ft high gorilla made entirely of spoons would actually look like. Uri Geller was clearly very pleased with the end result. Mr Geller , a friend of Prince Michael even signed bent spoons for a few of the children who came along to the unveiling. While Mr Geller laid down the challenge of creating a giant gorilla, Clive Knowles, managing director of the British Ironworks Centre, said the statue had been built for the nation and funded by the firm. Clive Knowles , managing director of the British Ironworks Centre said Clive Knowles , managing director of the British Ironworks Centre was hoping the statue would ultimately live somewhere more accessible to the public and that the firm was in contact with Great Ormond Street Hospital as a possible location. Many of the spoons have been sent from as far away as China, India, Kenya, Tahiti and Armenia. Mr Geller, a friend of Prince Michael, Mr Geller , a friend of Prince Michael donated a spoon once owned by Winston Churchill. Speaking at the unveiling, in front of a large crowd, Mr Geller described the statue as\" an amazing piece of art\". Mr Geller , a friend of Prince Michael said:\" the statue will not raise money for charity. the statue will do something better. the statue will amaze sick children.\"\" Mr Geller , a friend of Prince Michael am not going to look at the gorilla too hard in case the spoons bend,\" Mr Geller , a friend of Prince Michael added.\" It has been an amazing day and Clive has made the impossible possible. Sculptor Alfie Bradley, who has hand - welded every spoon to the statue, said Sculptor Alfie Bradley , who has hand - welded every spoon to the statue had been amazed at how the appeal for cutlery had taken off on social media.\" Initially we thought we only needed 5, 000 spoons, but it' s incredibly hard to calculate and it turned out we actually needed 40, 000,\" Sculptor Alfie Bradley , who has hand - welded every spoon to the statue said.\" It' s been incredibly repetitive, but It' s been a challenge. The spoons have been different sizes, different metals.\" Mr Bradley said the project had given Mr Bradley\" sleepless nights\" and now\" just the word ' spoon ' is enough to drive Mr Bradley crazy\". Mr Bradley added that the gorilla' s pose, with one fist breaking out of a cage, had been inspired by the film King Kong. Due to the number of spoons donated by schoolchildren across the world, Mr Bradley said Mr Bradley had come to think of the statue as\" a protector\" of children. Teams from the centre have given presentations at schools in Shropshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire in an appeal for spoons, but the firm soon looked overseas. Mr Knowles said Mr Knowles believed the past five months had cost the firm about Â £ 120, 000 in staff time, but described the past five months as an\" exciting rollercoaster of a ride\". Mr Knowles said the experience had given the firm\" an immense appetite to do something even better\" and appealed to the public to suggest a new project that would\" celebrate Britain\".",

Scarlets also had returning World Cup stars, with scrum - half Gareth Davies returning to the fold after Wales duty. The Welsh side took an early grip with a series of drives at the Leinster line that allowed centre Parkes the space to barrel over, centre Parkes try converted by Dan Jones. Leinster responded to put Scarlets under pressure, with lock Jake Ball sin - binned for overstepping the boundaries during some frantic defence. In lock Jake Ball absence Leinster closed the gap with two Madigan penalties, although Leinster lost Rob Kearney to injury and there could be a nervous wait to see if the Ireland full - back is fit for Europe next weekend. Back to full strength, Scarlets stretched away again as number eight John Barclay joined the line to put Owen away for an unconverted try. Madigan added a third penalty but Jones responded in kind to ensure Scarlets took a six - point lead into the break, although a six - point lead could have been more with Aled Thomas wide with a long - range kick.

Security sources have told the BBC that the NCSC believes that a hacking group known as Lazarus launched the attack. The US Computer Emergency Response Team has also warned about Lazarus. The same group is believed to have targeted Sony Pictures in 2014. The Sony hack came as the company planned to release the movie The Interview, a satire about the North Korean leadership starring Seth Rogen. The movie was eventually given a limited release after an initial delay. The same group is also thought to have been behind the theft of money from banks. In May, ransomware called WannaCry swept across the world, locking computers and demanding payment for computers to be unlocked. The NHS in the UK was particularly badly hit. Officials in Britain' s National Cyber Security Centre ( NCSC) began Officials in Britain ' s National Cyber Security Centre ( NCSC ) own investigation and concluded Officials in Britain ' s National Cyber Security Centre ( NCSC ) assessment in recent weeks. The ransomware did not target Britain or the NHS specifically, and may well have been a money - making scheme that got out of control, particularly since the hackers do not appear to have retrieved any of the ransom money as yet. Although the group is based in North Korea the exact role of the leadership in Pyongyang in ordering the attack is less clear. Private sector cyber - security researchers around the world began picking apart the code to try to understand who was behind the attack soon after. Adrian Nish, who leads the cyber threat intelligence team at BAE Systems, saw overlaps with previous code developed by the Lazarus group.\" It seems to tie back to the same code - base and the same authors,\" Nish says.\" The code - overlaps are significant.\" Private sector cyber security researchers reverse engineered the code but the British assessment by the NCSC - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - is likely to have been made based on a wider set of sources. America' s NSA has also more recently made the link to North Korea but America ' s NSA assessment is not thought to have been based on as deep as an investigation as the UK, partly because the US was not hit as hard by the incident. Officials say Officials have not seen any significant evidence supporting other possible culprits. North Korean hackers have been linked to money - making attacks in the past - such as the theft of $ 81m from the central bank of Bangladesh in 2016. This sophisticated attack involved making transfers through the Swift payment system which, in some cases, were then laundered through casinos in the Philippines. \" The May 2017 attack was one of the biggest bank heists of all time in physical space or in cyberspace,\" says Nish, who says further activity has been seen in banks in Poland and Mexico. The Lazarus group has also been linked to the use of ransomware - including against a South Korean supermarket chain. Other analysts say Other analysts saw signs of North Korea investigating the bitcoin method of payment in recent months. The May 2017 attack was indiscriminate rather than targeted. The May 2017 attack spread was global and may have only been slowed thanks to the work of a British researcher who was able to find a\" kill switch\" to slow The May 2017 attack down. The attacks caused huge disruption in the short term but The May 2017 attack may have also been a strategic failure for the group behind The May 2017 attack. Researchers at Elliptic, a UK - based company which tracks bitcoin payments, say Researchers at Elliptic , a UK - based company which tracks bitcoin payments have seen no withdrawals out of the wallets into which money was paid, although people are still paying in to the wallets into which money was paid. Those behind the attack may not have expected The May 2017 attack to have spread as fast as The May 2017 attack did. Once Those behind the attack realised that Those behind the attack behaviour was drawing global attention, the risks of moving the money may have been seen as too high given the relatively small amount involved, leaving Those behind the attack with little to show for Those behind the attack work. The revelation of the link to North Korea will raise difficult questions about what can be done to respond or deter such behaviour in the future.",

A rivalry born in the days of Bill Shankly and Don Revie, resurrected in the eras of Kenny Dalglish and Howard Wilkinson, consigned to longer memories post - Gerard Houllier and David O ' Leary. And this attracted the imagination of both sets of fans, Leeds bringing almost 5, 500 to a capacity crowd of 53, 000. While this tie did not have the allure of a title - swinging league match or Wembley cup final of previous eras, this tie did provide an opportunity for Leeds to test the Yorkshire side again at the highest level. Following a turbulent few seasons under Italian owner Massimo Cellino, there is a cautious optimism among Whites fans that Whites fans club may - finally - push for promotion back to the Premier League this season. Manager Garry Monk has provided a calm guidance rarely seen - or allowed - under Cellino' s control, moving the club up to fifth in the Championship after four wins in Leeds United past five matches. The odds were stacked heavily in favour of the home side prior to kick - off, but the visitors created several decent opportunities against a casual Reds defence. Ultimately, Leeds United lost with a fight. But the reception given by the away fans to the away fans players at the final whistle suggests the away fans are optimistic a 13 - year absence from the Premier League may be coming to an end in the near future. Leeds United manager Garry Monk:.\" Leeds United manager Garry Monk asked Leeds United to play in slightly different way to what Leeds United have been doing tactically, which Leeds United had to do against a very good side.\" Leeds United followed it to a tee. It just lacked Leeds United taking one of quite a few opportunities. Leeds United had the best chances of the game.\" It needed a bit more composure, needed' s the only negative. Better decision - making in the final third and Leeds United would have had a couple of goals. Overall Leeds United manager Garry Monk was gutted for the players.\" As a performance for a young, inexperienced team these type of nights set a marker for you. Leeds United' re growing. Leeds United are disappointed but Leeds United will look back in time and think Leeds United have put on a good performance.\" Leeds United manager Garry Monk' m not going to criticise Leeds United manager Garry Monk team - Leeds United were excellent.\" Back to a Premier League title push for Liverpool.

        "document": "The legend of Emperor Yu states that Emperor Yu tamed the flooded Yellow River by dredging and redirecting the flooded Yellow River channels, thereby laying the foundations for the Xia dynasty and Chinese civilisation. Previously, no scientific evidence had been found for a corresponding flood. But now a Chinese - led team has placed just such an event at about 1, 900BC. Writing in Science Magazine, the researchers describe a cataclysmic event in which a huge dam, dumped across the Jishi Gorge by a landslide, blocked the Yellow River for six to nine months. When the dam burst, up to 16 cubic kilometres of water inundated the lowlands downstream. The evidence for this sequence of events comes from sediments left by the dammed lake, high up the sides of Jishi Gorge, as well as deposits left kilometres downstream by the subsequent flood. Lead author Dr Wu Qinglong, from Nanjing Normal University, said Lead author Dr Wu Qinglong , from Nanjing Normal University and colleagues stumbled on sediments from the ancient dam during fieldwork in 2007.\" sediments from the ancient dam inspired a Chinese - led team to connect the next possible outburst flood with the abandonment of the prehistoric Lajia site 25km downstream,\" Lead author Dr Wu Qinglong , from Nanjing Normal University told journalists in a teleconference.\" But at that time a Chinese - led team had no idea what the evidence of a catastrophic outburst flood should be.\" The Lajia site, famously home to the world' s oldest noodles, is known as China' s Pompeii; the prehistoric Lajia site 25km downstream cave dwellings and many cultural artefacts were buried by a major earthquake.\" In July 2008 Lead author Dr Wu Qinglong , from Nanjing Normal University suddenly realised that the so - called black sand previously revealed by archaeologists at the Lajia site could be, in fact, the deposits from our outburst flood,\" Dr Wu said.\" The subsequent investigation confirmed this speculation and showed that the sediments from this outburst flood are up to 20m thick, and up to 50m higher than the Yellow River - indicating an unprecedented, devastating flood.\" Lead author Dr Wu Qinglong , from Nanjing Normal University and Lead author Dr Wu Qinglong , from Nanjing Normal University colleagues suggest in a Chinese - led team paper that the very same earthquake that destroyed the Lajia dwellings probably dammed the river upstream. Less than a year later, the waters returned with a vengeance.\" The flood was about 300 - 500, 000 cubic metres per second,\" said co - author Dr Darryl Granger, from Purdue University in the US.\" about 300 - 500 , 000 cubic metres per second' s roughly equivalent to the largest flood ever measured on the Amazon river; about 300 - 500 , 000 cubic metres per second' s among the largest known floods to have happened on Earth during the past 10, 000 years.\" Using carbon dating - on flood deposits and even on fragments of bone from earthquake victims at Lajia - the researchers date the megaflood to 1, 922BC,\" plus or minus about 28 years\", Dr Granger said. If the flood was indeed the source of the Emperor Yu legend then the founding of the Xia dynasty presumably occurred within a few decades, in about 1, 900BC. This date is 200 - 300 years later than many previous estimations. But Emperor Yu' s tale is difficult to pin down using traditional historical sources; the story survived as oral history for a millennium and the Emperor Yu legend first known written record dates to around 1, 000BC. On the other hand a later, circa 1, 900 commencement for the Xia supports that idea that this first dynasty coincided with the transition from Stone Age to Bronze Age ways of living. Some archaeologists have already linked the Xia dynasty with the Erlitou culture, an early Bronze Age society known from digs elsewhere in the Yellow River valley. Dr David Cohen from National Taiwan University, another co - author, said the study was remarkable because of the multiple lines of evidence involved.\" We have the geological evidence of just a huge outburst flood, which is incredible in itself,\" Dr David Cohen from National Taiwan University , another co - author said.\" But then there' s this coincidence of this flood co - occurring with the destruction of the Lajia site - which is able to give us very, very precise datesâ € ¦ and then that this flood was of such a scale and corresponds in time, and along the Yellow River, with both the beginnings of Bronze Age civilisation and the legend of the great flood the great flood itself.\" the Emperor Yu legend' s just this amazing story. All these different approaches coming together - it is just great luck.\" Prof David Montgomery of the University of Washington is a geomorphologist with an interest in what rocks can tell us about ancient myths and legends. Prof David Montgomery of the University of Washington was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary for the journal and discussed the findings on the BBC World Service programme Science in Action. Among the world' s various flood myths, Prof Montgomery said, Emperor Yu' s story is an odd one.\" the Emperor Yu legend' s not about surviving. Emperor Yu ' s basic story is about draining the flood waters; the Emperor Yu legend' s about river engineering.\" The case made for the Jishi Gorge megaflood is a plausible one, Prof David Montgomery of the University of Washington said, particularly because The case made for the Jishi Gorge megaflood describes a flood that would have broken the Yellow River' s banks far downstream and re - routed the Yellow River ' s flow. Prof Montgomery said a flood that would have broken the Yellow River ' s banks far downstream and re - routed its flow is just the sort of event that would take decades to deal with - and a long battle with the waters is a feature of the Yu myth.\" It' s very difficult to ever actually prove the origin of pre - written history events. But they' ve made a very interesting case, that Jonathan' m sure geologists will continue to poke at, and investigate, and argue about - because that' s what geologists do.\" At a purely geological level, Jonathan added, the flood is a major and intriguing discovery.\" But the cultural connection - possibly explaining the origin of the Chinese flood story - is too intriguing to ignore.\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter.",

Harry Chapman Pincher , son of an Army officer investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly Harry Chapman Pincher , son of an Army officer bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell Harry Chapman Pincher , son of an Army officer things. Harry Chapman Pincher , son of an Army officer favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L ' Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster. Only after a classy French restaurant called L ' Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly , handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster closed did Harry Chapman Pincher , son of an Army officer learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. ( a classy French restaurant called L ' Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly , handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster had also, MI5 discovered when removing MI5 own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.)\" MI5 heard every conversation that Harry Chapman Pincher , son of an Army officer had and MI5 did nothing about heard,\" Harry Chapman Pincher , son of an Army officer said.\" All MI5 did was put every conversation that I had in the files. MI5 doesn' t like to take any action; MI5 like to know.\" ' every conversation that I had' s in the files: if MI5 take action, they' ll know MI5 know. ' That' s the attitude. That' s absolutely crazy.\" Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside. In the 1950s Pincher ' s took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus - fours at pheasant and grouse. Lord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered Lord Mountbatten , aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff shooting.\" Lord Mountbatten , aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff invited Pincher ' s to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to Pincher ' s once when Pincher ' s was travelling in Lord Mountbatten , aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under Pincher ' s name, not Lord Mountbatten , aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff.\" In 1964 Pincher ' s brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti' s Â £ 5 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain' s air defences. This was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than Â £ 4 million to the Treasury. In 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies. This prompted Edward Heath' s government to expel 105 of the diplomats , chauffeurs and gardeners, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union' s espionage capability. After Pincher ' s retirement, Pincher' s most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. Their Trade is Treachery revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy. There was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying. In the years since, Pincher hardened Pincher ' s line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole. Not everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5' s official historian, thinks it' s nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor. Rupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced.\" Some people don' t believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service.\" Personally Rupert Allason , who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West' ve seen the evidence: Rupert Allason , who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West know there was penetration up until at least September 1963.\" Where Rupert Allason , who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. Pincher ' s believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, Rupert Allason , who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West' m not convinced of was; but Rupert Allason , who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West am persuaded there was a mole.\" One of the main sources for Pincher' s book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication. Margaret Thatcher' s government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher. In May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked\" secret\", to Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan minister of defence.\" Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan do not understand,\" Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote,\" how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher?\" Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan am getting very concerned about how well informed Mr Chapman Pincher always seems to be on defence matters.\" And the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher' s finest moment in 1967. What became known as\" the D notice affair\" began with a\" walk - in\", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper' s front door with a possible scoop. The information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ. Before publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee. The D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published. Lohan told Pincher Mr Chapman Pincher story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop. Wilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express. In Mr Chapman Pincher Who' s Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of Mr Chapman Pincher recreations. Mr Chapman Pincher said Mr Chapman Pincher didn' t regret a single thing Mr Chapman Pincher had found out and printed.\" Mr Chapman Pincher always tried to meet all the top people because meet' s where the stories lay,\" Mr Chapman Pincher said.\" When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.\"",

A police car reportedly came under fire and a person was hurt in an apparently unrelated shooting in the same area. Black teenager Michael Brown was shot by a white policeman on 9 August. The shooting of the 18 - year - old as Mr Brown walked down a street drew allegations of police brutality among people in the mainly black suburb of Ferguson. A riot erupted on Friday night, with local stores targeted by looters, after police named the officer who shot Mr Brown and also released CCTV from a shop where Mr Brown apparently stole a pack of cigars and intimidated the owner just before Mr Brown death. A five - hour curfew, running from midnight ( 05: 00 GMT), was imposed in response. US civil rights leader Al Sharpton has said a peaceful rally, led by Michael Brown' s family, is planned for later on Sunday. The teenager' s killing caused dismay across the US, with peaceful nationwide vigils held on Thursday night, while images of riot police deployed in an American city suburb have made headlines worldwide. Seven arrests were made when police moved to break up the protest at a barbecue restaurant. Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who was put in charge of bringing calm back to Ferguson, said police had moved in after receiving a report of people breaking into the restaurant and climbing on to the roof. As police were nearing the restaurant, a man with a handgun went into the street but ran away, AP news agency reports. the attacker also shot at a police car but it was not clear if a police car had been hit. In the same area, a person was shot and critically wounded and police were searching for the attacker. Demonstrators complained that the curfew would make matters worse. As police prepared to move on the protesters during the night, a chant of\" No justice! No curfew!\" could be heard from the crowd, followed by\" the crowd of about 150 in the suburb of Ferguson have the right to assemble peacefully\". Jayson Ross, who was leading the protesters toward the police before tear gas was fired, was quoted as saying by AP:\" the police got guns. the crowd of about 150 in the suburb of Ferguson got guns. the crowd of about 150 in the suburb of Ferguson are ready.\" Local politician Antonio French, who was with the protesters, tweeted to say:\" Too many young men talking about Too many young men' re ready to die tonight.\" Governor Jay Nixon said Governor Jay Nixon would not allow a handful of looters to endanger the community.\" This is a test,\" Governor Jay Nixon said.\" The eyes of the world are watching. We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.\" The US justice department is investigating the shooting of Mr Brown, with 40 FBI agents dispatched to Ferguson to gather information. Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson revealed on Friday that the officer who shot Mr Brown was Darren Wilson, a six - year police veteran with no previous complaints against the officer who shot Mr Brown. Mr Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Commenting on the CCTV footage that was released, Chief Jackson said that Mr Wilson had not known Mr Brown was a robbery suspect. The policeman had reportedly stopped the teenager for walking in the street, disrupting traffic. Mr Brown' s family condemned the release of the footage as a police attempt to\" justify the execution - style murder\".",

For four seasons, viewers have seen Robin Wright in the role of Claire Underwood, the Machiavellian partner of stop - at - nothing politician, Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey. Both actors have also directed and produced episodes of the show. But while Both actors roles are equally prominent, for years Both actors salaries were not in parity.\" Robin Wright was like, ' Robin Wright want to be paid the same as Kevin. ' It was a perfect paradigm and example to use, because there are very few films or TV shows where the male — the patriarch and the matriarch are equal. And the male — the patriarch and the matriarch are in House of Cards,\" Robin Wright told an audience at New York' s Rockefeller Foundation. Wright looked at statistics which showed that for some time, Robin Wright character was more popular than Spacey' s.\" So Robin Wright capitalised on statistics which showed that for some time , her character was more popular than Spacey ' s. Robin Wright was like, ' You better pay Robin Wright or Robin Wright' m going to go public … and You did. '\" Wright' s success at equalising Robin Wright pay is a story to be noted, because Wright ' s success at equalising her pay is still incredibly rare.\" Robin Wright is playing a popular and important character in a series. Robin Wright has leverage and Robin Wright used leverage,\" says Lisa Maatz, vice president for government relations at the American Association of University Women ( AAUW), which has conducted research into the broader issue.\" Lisa Maatz , vice president for government relations at the American Association of University Women ( AAUW ) , which has conducted research into the broader issue admire Robin Wright for standing up to You. Not everybody is going to be as fortunate. But Robin Wright situation in terms of being underpaid is far too common.\" US government statistics show that on average, women are paid less than women male counterparts, 79 cents for every dollar a man earns. According to the White House, the median wage of a woman working full - time all year in America is about $ 39, 600 ( £ 27, 116), 79 % of a man' s median earnings, which stand at $ 50, 400. The statistic is widely used to illustrate the discrepancy in pay across the sexes, and looks across all sectors. In Fresno, California, Aileen Rizo took a similar stand against Aileen Rizo employer after Aileen Rizo learned Aileen Rizo was receiving less pay than a new male employee, who didn' t have a masters degree like Aileen Rizo did. Ms Rizo had been working as a maths consultant for four years for Fresno County Office of Education, when Ms Rizo ' s found out that the new hire was being paid at the highest salary scale ( a nine), while Ms Rizo ' s was being paid at the lowest ( a one). When Ms Rizo ' s confronted Ms Rizo ' s human resources department about the difference, Ms Rizo ' s was told the difference wasn' t a mistake.\" her human resources department said her human resources department' d used Ms Rizo ' s prior pay as a guide, and used' s why Ms Rizo ' s was on less,\" Ms Rizo ' s explained. Ms Rizo began legal action against Ms Rizo ' s employers in 2013, who argued Fresno County Office of Education set wages based on the employee' s most recent salary, plus a five percent increase. Experience wasn' t a determining factor, Fresno County Office of Education said. Representatives for Fresno County pointed out that a woman working in the same department as Ms Rizo, was being paid more, and said that in the past 25 years more women had been on higher salary scales, than men in the same or similar position in the department. The court ruled in Ms Rizo' s favour, arguing that the fact another woman earned more than Ms Rizo ' s, shouldn' t diminish Ms Rizo ' s right to a fair wage. Ms Rizo ' s employers appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing. Since Ms Rizo ' s began Ms Rizo ' s lawsuit, Ms Rizo is now receiving the same pay as Ms Rizo ' s male colleague, but Ms Rizo ' s continues to fight for backdated wages. Ms Rizo ' s also testified before the California legislature, which has since passed an Equal Pay Act in the state. While Ms Rizo ' s believes employers need to be more transparent and fair, Ms Rizo ' s does also think women could also do more.\" women do need to get better at negotiating. Ms Rizo ' s was trusting an organisation to act in a way of integrity. Ms Rizo ' s took for granted that an organisation' s where everyone started.\"\" Whether you have to file a lawsuit or demand it and get it, women need to empower others and educate society about a problem that' s still evident,\" Ms Rizo ' s says. But the scale of the problem is something which is widely debated. Some critics say the\" 79 cents for every dollar\" statistic is misleading, because the \" 79 cents for every dollar \" statistic doesn' t compare two people working in the same job, with the same background and qualifications. When those factors are taken into account, there still is a gender pay gap, but the percentage difference is much smaller, at around 7 %. \" The idea that when a young woman graduates, the idea a young woman' s going to get paid 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, working in the same job, across our economy is a myth,\" argues Karin Agness, who is president of the Network of Enlightened Women, a conservative policy group. Ms Agness believes that the 79 cents statistic gives young graduates a false impression of the workplace young graduates' re about to enter.\" the 79 cents statistic creates a victim mentality in women, and our don' t want our young women going into the workforce thinking our young women are victims just because our young women are women,\" Karin Agness , who is president of the Network of Enlightened Women , a conservative policy group says. But Lisa Maatz from the AAUW says both measures are valid - one is more general, the other specifically compares similar roles - but both measures point to a discrepancy which needs to be addressed.\" The gender wage gap has many causes and contributors, including differences in education, experience, occupation and industry, and family responsibilities. But even after accounting for these factors, a gap still remains between men' s earnings and women' s earnings,\" argues a White House report on the issue. Data on the pay gap for Hispanic and black women shows greater disparities. The gap between similar jobs fluctuates wildly based on the sector. And even controlling for similar jobs, the gap grows for women who are promoted into the director and executive level. For Ms Maatz, there are other areas which also need to be addressed when it comes to wage disparity, for example the rise of so - called\" pink collar\" jobs, in which certain roles such as nurses, secretaries and teachers, are devalued simply because more women do certain roles such as nurses , secretaries and teachers. But Robin Wright' s experience is a reminder that the gender pay gap affects women across all professions. Robin Wright ' s hopes Robin Wright ' s example will encourage other women to speak up.\" It' s a male dominant workplace society. It always has been. And that' s just the history.\" But that has to be unacceptable at this stage.\" Follow Rajini Vaidyanathan on Twitter - @ BBCRajiniv.",

The Nobel laureate Sir Tim Hunt was heavily criticised for The Nobel laureate Sir Tim Hunt disparaging remarks about women in science last week, which for some raised the issue of where women stood in the scientific community. The larger truth is that women have made big and important discoveries in science - think of Dorothy Hodgkin, the brilliant crystallographer who mapped the structure of penicillin and went on to be awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964. Hodgkin was the first woman to win the prestigious Copley Medal, and Dorothy Hodgkin , the brilliant crystallographer who mapped the structure of penicillin and went on to be awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964 remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in the sciences. Yet at the time, the newspapers carried headlines such as\" Oxford housewife wins Nobel\". But many female scientists in the past were not given the credit many female scientists in the past deserved for many female scientists in the past achievements. As a result, many female scientists in the past names have all but disappeared from public consciousness. Here are just a few. Esther Lederberg, a microbiologist, conducted groundbreaking research in the field of genetics. Esther Lederberg , a microbiologist developed basic techniques that have gone a long way towards helping scientists understand how genes work. Esther Lederberg , a microbiologist work helped Esther Lederberg , a microbiologist husband, Joshua, win a Nobel prize in 1958, but Esther Lederberg , a microbiologist was not cited in the award. The British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering X - ray crystallographer. The British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin image of the DNA molecule was critical to deciphering the DNA molecule structure - one of the biggest and most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century - but it was James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins who received the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for James Watson , Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins work. Ida Tacke made huge advances in both chemistry and atomic physics. It was Ida Tacke who managed to find two new elements, rhenium and masurium, that Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted would form part of the periodic table. Ida Tacke gets credit in the science books for the discovery of rhenium. But masurium is now known as technetium, the discovery of which is attributed to Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre. Tacke' s evidence was ignored until Perrier and Segre artificially created the element in a laboratory. Tacke is also credited with being the first person to open up the idea of nuclear fission. Lise Meitner' s work in nuclear physics led to the discovery of nuclear fission - where atomic nuclei split in two. This laid the groundwork for the atomic bomb. After moving to Berlin in 1907, Meitner collaborated with chemist Otto Hahn over many decades. But Hahn published their findings without including Meitner as a co - author. And chemist Otto Hahn went on to win the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for chemist Otto Hahn contributions to splitting the atom. Chien - Shiung Wu was one of the most important physicists of the 20th Century. Chien - Shiung Wu participated in the development of the atom bomb, as part of the Manhattan Project. Yet few know Chien - Shiung Wu name today. In the 1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung - Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, asked Wu to help disprove what is known in physics as the law of parity. Wu' s experiments turned this law on this law head. This landmark moment in physics led to a 1957 Nobel Prize for Yang and Lee, but not for Wu, who was left out despite the key role Chien - Shiung Wu played. Another neglected pioneer is the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt, who helped change the way we see the universe. the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt , who helped change the way we see the universe began the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt , who helped change the way we see the universe work by measuring and recording stars at the Harvard Observatory - one of the few jobs in science that was considered suitable for women. Leavitt spotted a pattern between the brightness of a star and a star distance from the Earth. a pattern between the brightness of a star and its distance from the Earth led the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt , who helped change the way we see the universe to uncover what is known as the period - luminosity relationship, allowing scientists to calculate how far away a star was from Earth based on a star brightness. The Royal Society - swift in The Royal Society condemnation of Sir Tim' s remarks - was founded in 1660 and has yet to elect a female president. The Royal Society represents the scientific establishment in the UK, and The Royal Society early members included Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Women were not permitted to become fellows until 1945, almost 300 years after The Royal Society foundation. Some say that the comments from Sir Tim - a prominent fellow of the society - will damage the efforts The Royal Society is making to improve diversity. It has been reported that only 6 % of The Royal Society fellows - a prestigious title in the world of science - are women.

        "document": "The fratricide within the Republican Party is getting much of the national attention, but the two remaining Democratic candidates - and the two remaining Democratic candidates supporters - are starting to swing some sharp elbows. The Wisconsin primary on Tuesday marks the beginning of the Democratic presidential campaign' s endgame. More than half the pledged delegates have already been apportioned, and only a few truly landscape - altering battlegrounds - New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California - remain on the calendar. Mr Sanders can claim momentum, with wins in five of the last six contests, but Mr Sanders needs a sizeable victory in Wisconsin if Mr Sanders wants to properly set the stage for the critical coming contests and cut into Mrs Clinton' s 263 delegate lead. It' s enough to set both candidates on edge. On Thursday, when confronted by a Greenpeace activist in New York about whether Mrs Clinton ' s could address climate change while taking donations from the fossil fuel industry, Mrs Clinton showed a rare flash of anger.\" Mrs Clinton ' s am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about Mrs Clinton ' s,\" Mrs Clinton ' s said. Mrs Clinton ' s campaign would later assert that the former secretary of state, like Mr Sanders, takes donations from individuals employed in the energy sector but is prohibited from accepting money from corporations. a rare flash of anger was a moment of emotion for a usually carefully controlled candidate - and the Sanders camp quickly responded.\" If the Clinton campaign wants to argue that industry lobbyists giving thousands of dollars to Mrs Clinton ' s campaign won' t affect Mrs Clinton ' s decisions if Mrs Clinton ' s' s elected, wants' s fine,\" Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver said.\" But to call the Sanders campaign liars for pointing out basic facts about the secretary' s fundraising is deeply cynical and very disappointing.\" It was just one of numerous recent shots between the two campaigns. When Mrs Clinton unveiled manufacturing proposals on Friday, a Sanders spokesperson said the former secretary of state has embraced\" policies that have decimated the manufacturing industry... and eliminated millions of jobs across the country\". Trump' s disastrous women voter problem - This voting bloc could doom in chances in the general election. # BernieMadeMeWhite: Minority supporters of Sanders speak out - Supporters push back against\" all - white\" narrative. Trump, Clinton and the ' None of the Above ' era - Rarely have those running for high office been held in such low esteem. Full US election coverage from the BBC. At a campaign event, Mr Sanders offered criticisms of Mrs Clinton' s six - figure speeches to Wall Street firms, Mrs Clinton ' s foreign policy views and Mrs Clinton ' s position on environmental issues, as Mr Sanders supporters heartily booed. On Saturday Mrs Clinton noted that Mrs Clinton ' s has been a\" proud Democrat Mrs Clinton ' s adult life\" - drawing a contrast with Mr Sanders, who is a self identified\" democratic socialist\" who serves in Congress as an independent.\" Mrs Clinton ' s think been is kind of important if we are selecting someone to be the Democratic nominee of the Democratic Party,\" Mrs Clinton said.\" Mr Sanders , who is a self identified \" democratic socialist \" who serves in Congress as an independent think the secretary is getting very nervous,\" Mr Sanders countered on Sunday, noting that polls show Mr Sanders , who is a self identified \" democratic socialist \" who serves in Congress as an independent doing better than Mrs Clinton against Republican front - runner Donald Trump.\" Mr Sanders , who is a self identified \" democratic socialist \" who serves in Congress as an independent think we' ve got a lot of young people' s vote, working - class people' s vote,\" Mr Sanders said.\" Mr Sanders , who is a self identified \" democratic socialist \" who serves in Congress as an independent think we' re on the way to a victory if we can win the Democratic nomination.\" This tension in the Democrat race is a relatively recent development. Last autumn, Mr Sanders famously said during the first debate that Mr Sanders , who is a self identified \" democratic socialist \" who serves in Congress as an independent was\" sick and tired\" of talking about Mrs Clinton' s email server imbroglio - passing on a chance to target what could have been a key weakness in Mr Sanders , who is a self identified \" democratic socialist \" who serves in Congress as an independent main opponent. When Mr Sanders entered the race, Mr Sanders , who is a self identified \" democratic socialist \" who serves in Congress as an independent said Mr Sanders , who is a self identified \" democratic socialist \" who serves in Congress as an independent wasn' t interested in running a negative political campaign. It was a strategic decision that has led to some recent second - guessing among advisers within the candidate' s campaign, as witnessed by a surprisingly pessimistic story in the New York Times on Monday.\" The central complication with Bernie is that Mr Sanders , who is a self identified \" democratic socialist \" who serves in Congress as an independent never wanted to cross into the zone of personal attacks because cross would undercut Mr Sanders , who is a self identified \" democratic socialist \" who serves in Congress as an independent brand,\" Sanders adviser Tad Devine told the Times. That hasn' t stopped acrimony from flaring among the two candidates ' supporters, however - even in typically restrained states like Wisconsin. Lisa Stubek, a state representative who endorsed Mrs Clinton early in the campaign, says Lisa Stubek , a state representative who endorsed Mrs Clinton early in the campaign' s caught fire from pro - Sanders constituents in the ultra - liberal state capital of Madison.\" Bernie Sanders supporters are pretty relentless, unfortunately, as far as Bernie Sanders supporters support and as far as attacking those who support anyone but Bernie Sanders supporters candidate,\" Lisa Stubek , a state representative who endorsed Mrs Clinton early in the campaign said.\" And are' s not true of everyone, but certainly there is a core group of Bernie Sanders supporters here in Madison who do attacking.\" While Ms Stubek says that the campaign has largely been above - the - board, things have taken a turn for the worse.\" Lisa Stubek , a state representative who endorsed Mrs Clinton early in the campaign think certainly when you have Bernie Sanders out there stretching the truth or out - and - out lying, things do heat up,\" Lisa Stubek , a state representative who endorsed Mrs Clinton early in the campaign said.\" Lisa Stubek , a state representative who endorsed Mrs Clinton early in the campaign' m glad that Hillary is out there defending Mrs Clinton ' s record. More than anything people in our state want the facts.\" Another Madison - area Democratic representative, Melissa Sargent, says Another Madison - area Democratic representative , Melissa Sargent decided not to endorse a presidential candidate in part because the noise between the two candidates would drown out Another Madison - area Democratic representative , Melissa Sargent efforts to address other issues and local campaigns.\" When Another Madison - area Democratic representative , Melissa Sargent go to doors and Another Madison - area Democratic representative , Melissa Sargent' m stumping for Another Madison - area Democratic representative , Melissa Sargent local candidates, Another Madison - area Democratic representative , Melissa Sargent can talk about the things that Another Madison - area Democratic representative , Melissa Sargent want to talk about and Another Madison - area Democratic representative , Melissa Sargent can hear authentically what folks are saying,\" Another Madison - area Democratic representative , Melissa Sargent said.\" It felt like Another Madison - area Democratic representative , Melissa Sargent wouldn' t be able to navigate the path that Another Madison - area Democratic representative , Melissa Sargent am with these other races.\" Democrats in Wisconsin are quick to note that Democrats in Wisconsin challenges are nothing compared to what the Republicans are facing, as the Republicans two leading candidates engage in harsh negative attacks and exchange barbs over their two leading candidates wives and marital infidelity. Brett Hulsey, a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders, called the Republican campaign a\" food fight circus\".\" Democrats are still fighting by the Queensberry Rules,\" Brett Hulsey , a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders said, drawing a boxing analogy. Brett Hulsey , a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders cautions that while tempers seem to be flaring among Democrats at this point, things will eventually calm down. If Mrs Clinton wins, Brett Hulsey , a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders plans to support Mrs Clinton - and Brett Hulsey , a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders predicts most Sanders backers will follow suit.\" We' re in the middle of the fray right now,\" Brett Hulsey , a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders said.\" Brett Hulsey , a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders remind everybody to take a few deep breaths and remain calm. Brett Hulsey , a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders' ve worked every presidential since 1980 for Jimmy Carter. Brett Hulsey , a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders' ve seen this movie before.\" At a rally in Madison on Sunday night it seemed an era of good feelings may have returned. Mr Sanders spoke to a crowd of 4, 200 for more than an hour and made no mention of Mr Sanders Democratic opponent. Instead, Mr Sanders focused Mr Sanders criticism on Mr Trump and Republican Governor ( and former candidate) Scott Walker. Mr Sanders also seemed to be broadening Mr Sanders perspective.\" This campaign is about more than just electing a president of the United States, although Mr Sanders would very much appreciate your support,\" Mr Sanders said.\" This campaign' s about creating a political revolution.\" After the event, Jess A Weber - who had travelled to Madison from Illinois to volunteer for the Sanders campaign - said Jess A Weber - who had travelled to Madison from Illinois to volunteer for the Sanders campaign appreciated that Mr Sanders has tried to run a positive campaign.\" Mr Sanders continues to pull focus back to the message and back to our strength in unifying, coming together instead of dividing and bringing anyone down,\" Jess A Weber - who had travelled to Madison from Illinois to volunteer for the Sanders campaign said. On the campaign trail in Janesville on Monday, however, Mr Sanders was back to swiping at Mr Sanders opponent for Mrs Clinton past positions on international trade and commerce. \" Mr Sanders have voted against and led the opposition to every one of these disastrous trade agreements,\" Mr Sanders said.\" Secretary Clinton has supported virtually every one.\" The Democratic race is far from a bare - knuckle fight, but the candidates aren' t done trying to draw blood.",

The findings were published on Tuesday by Statistics Canada. The annual report by the federal statistics agency was compiled using police data from across the country. Nearly half of all incidents were linked to race or ethnicity, with black Canadians the most common target. Just over a third of reported hate crimes were motivated by hatred of a religion. Canada' s Jewish population remained the most targeted religious group, accounting for 13 % of all incidents, despite a decline in the overall number of reported crimes. Shimon Koffler Fogel, with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, called the data\" disturbing and clear\". Shimon Koffler Fogel , with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs also said in the statement that the Jewish community stood with other targeted groups in condemning hatred in all hatred in all its forms forms.\" An attack on one of all of us is an attack on all of all of us,\" Shimon Koffler Fogel , with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs said. Muslims reported being more frequently targeted in 2015, with 159 incidents reported compared with 99 in 2014, accounting for 12 % of all incidents. However, Statistics Canada notes many police services have reached out to ethnic communities and there have been efforts by groups like the National Council of Canadian Muslims ( NCCM) to encourage reporting. Incidents targeting Catholics also increased, jumping from 35 to 55 individual incidents. Almost 40 % of all reported hate crimes were considered violent incidents, which could include assault and uttering threats. Members of the LGBT community reported slightly fewer hate crimes in 2015 but were more likely to be the victims of hate - related violence. In a news conference following the report' s release, the NCCM' s legal counsel, Khalid Elgazzar, pointed to the murder of six men in a Quebec City mosque this January as\" a painful reminder of how hate can destroy lives and deeply shake communities\". The NCCM was joined by other groups in calling for more funding and resources for police forces to fight hate crimes and improve reporting. The Statistics Canada report notes that the figures do not paint a full picture of the true extent of hate crime in Canada. the figures suggest that only about 35 % of hate crimes are actually reported to police.",

But because the global population is growing and more people are living well into old age, researchers predict the number of people with sight problems will soar in the coming decades.

This weekend' s annual congress will be dominated by new championship proposals in football and hurling. The plans put forward by GAA director general Paraic Duffy include completing the All - Ireland Senior Championships by the end of August. Also included is a new round - robin format for the All - Ireland SFC quarter - finals, which would mean more games. This proposal has proved particularly controversial in recent weeks. Both the Gaelic Players ' Association and recently formed Club Players ' Association have come out against Duffy' s plans, although not necessarily for the same reasons. Ostensibly, the main reason for these mooted changes is to try and ensure more regular games for club players but there is a certain amount of bafflement as to how ensure can be squared with the motion to have a round - robin stage in the All - Ireland Football quarter - finals. The new club players ' body has been angered after the GAA' s top brass refused to grant recently formed Club Players ' Association a speaking platform at the Croke Park gathering. However, that may change at further annual gatherings of GAA delegates if a motion for the club players ' body to be officially recognised is passed in Dublin. All the indications are that the votes on both the so - called new ' Super Eight football round ' and the proposal to bring forward the All - Ireland finals will be exceptionally close, with a two - thirds ' majority required for the format changes to be tried for a three - year period. To make matters even complicated, congress will also hear a number of motions calls from the two - thirds majority to be scrapped, with one call suggestion a simple majority and another calling for the figure to be lowered to 60 %. Inevitably, those motions will require a two - thirds majority to be passed. Going into the weekend, Croke Park' s desire for replays to be scrapped - in favour of extra - time - in all championship games bar provincial and All - Ireland finals looks likely to be comfortably passed. At last year' s congress, motions to move All - Ireland Finals to earlier in the year and scrap replays were both defeated, although the finals proposal fell narrowly short after getting support from 60. 8 % of delegates.",

        "document": "The choice of a running mate is one of the most crucial decisions a candidate will make during a presidential run. Mr Romney ' s is looking for a number two who can balance Mr Romney ' s weaknesses, appeal to new voter constituencies, persuade independent voters to give Mr Romney ' s a second look, and campaign effectively on Mr Romney ' s behalf. All the while, Mr Romney will need a partner who will not outshine Mr Romney ' s on the stump or otherwise detract attention from Mr Romney ' s. The perfect VP pick will also need to convince voters he or she is ready to assume the presidency if anything happens to Mr Romney - to be just a heartbeat away from the Oval Office, as the American political adage goes. As Mr Romney nears a decision, here are some of the top possibilities:. Paul Ryan, 42, has made a name for The Wisconsin congressman , chairman of the House Budget committee as the top Republican on budget issues, calling for a dramatic reduction in entitlement programmes and other government spending and in taxes. The Wisconsin congressman, chairman of the House Budget committee, is seen as a persuasive surrogate with the capacity to take the Romney campaign on the offensive on issues that are likely to dominate in this election year - such as jobs, the economy and the deficit. The Wisconsin congressman , chairman of the House Budget committee is also a staunch conservative from a state that both parties consider to be up for grabs in the coming election. Since becoming chairman of the House Budget committee in 2007, Mr Ryan has worked on shaping an alternative vision for the federal budget. But Mr Ryan' s budget proposals are seen as so severe and conservative that Mr Ryan ' s budget proposals could pose a problem for Mr Romney among independent voters less keen to slash taxes and cherished social programmes. Mr Ryan studied at Ohio' s Miami University and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998 at the age of 28. The Wisconsin congressman , chairman of the House Budget committee is currently serving The Wisconsin congressman , chairman of the House Budget committee seventh term. Rob Portman, 56, is a veteran of Washington, having served in the House of Representatives for 12 years and in White House roles under both Presidents Bush. In selecting Rob Portman , 56 ,, Mr Romney would hope to pick up votes from the crucial battleground state of Ohio, while also having a competent veteran of Washington on the ticket. But Mr Portman' s strengths are also Rob Portman , 56 , weaknesses. Often portrayed as dull, Rob Portman , 56 , brings little excitement and pizzazz to the ticket. Rob Portman , 56 , years in Washington would detract from Mr Romney' s effort to run as a political outsider. And Rob Portman , 56 , role in the second Bush White House could turn off both independent voters and hard - core fiscal conservatives angered by Mr Bush' s expansion of government spending and Mr Bush ' s widening of the federal budget deficit. Mr Portman was born in Cincinnati and educated at Dartmouth College and the University of Michigan law school. Later, he worked in legal roles in George Bush Sr' s White House. he served in the US House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, when George Bush Jr appointed he US Trade Representative. In 2006, Mr Bush appointed he director of the Office of Management and Budget, a role in which he helped formulate White House budget and tax policy. he left that job in 2007. In 2010 he was elected to the Senate, succeeding Republican George Voinovich. Tim Pawlenty, 51, is seen as a\" Sam' s Club Republican\" for Tim Pawlenty , 51 , supposed appeal to working and lower - middle class voters ( Sam' s Club is a chain of giant discount stores run by Wal - Mart). Mr Pawlenty made Tim Pawlenty , 51 , own brief run for the Republican nomination, but quit the race in 2011 before a vote was counted when Tim Pawlenty , 51 , failed to gain traction with voters or the media. Tim Pawlenty , 51 , could help balance Mr Romney' s wealthy, patrician image and certainly brings enough political experience to the table. Currently without a full - time job, Tim Pawlenty , 51 , has been an effective surrogate for Mr Romney on the campaign trail, and the men get on well personally. But Tim Pawlenty , 51 , is seen as lacking charisma, and Tim Pawlenty , 51 , does not bring to the ticket a geographic constituency - Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, having last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 1972, and before 1972, in 1956. Mr Pawlenty has also broken from current Republican orthodoxy on a number of issues, including on energy and environmental policy ( although Tim Pawlenty , 51 , later renounced Tim Pawlenty , 51 , backing for\" cap and trade\" plans), and with a call for universal health insurance for children. Mr Pawlenty grew up in a family of modest means in South St Paul, the son of a trucking company worker. Tim Pawlenty , 51 , studied law at the University of Minnesota and was elected to the state House of Representatives from a suburban district in 1992. Tim Pawlenty , 51 , rose in the state House, winning the role of Republican majority leader in 1999. In 2002, Tim Pawlenty , 51 , was elected governor. Tim Pawlenty , 51 , was mentioned as a possible vice - presidential running mate to John McCain in 2008. Marco Rubio, 41, is everything Mr Portman and Mr Pawlenty are not: The son of Cuban immigrants , Mr Rubio is young, handsome, energetic, and a gifted and engaging public speaker and television presence. The son of Cuban immigrants , Mr Rubio is a darling of the conservative populist Tea Party movement, giving The son of Cuban immigrants , Mr Rubio a grassroots appeal Mr Romney' s other options lack. The son of Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio could conceivably dent Mr Obama' s overwhelming advantage with Hispanic voters. And The son of Cuban immigrants , Mr Rubio could help carry the crucial state of Florida for the Republican ticket. But Mr Rubio also brings drawbacks. At 41, Mr Rubio , a lawyer by training is younger than Mr Obama was in 2008, and Mr Rubio , a lawyer by training has less experience on the national political stage than the president did when President Barack Obama ' s launched President Barack Obama ' s run for the White House. When Mr Rubio was young, Mr Rubio , a lawyer by training family briefly attended a Mormon church, which would risk alienating some evangelical Christian voters already suspicious of Mr Romney' s Mormon faith. And it is unclear the extent to which Mr Rubio could win Hispanic votes from the Democrats. The majority of Hispanic Americans have a Mexican background and are unlikely to identify with a Cuban American merely because they speak the same language. Mr Rubio, a lawyer by training, was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000 and rose through the leadership to become House speaker in 2008. In 2010 Mr Rubio , a lawyer by training was elected to the US Senate. Bobby Jindal, 41, was the first Indian American elected governor. In choosing Mr Jindal ' s, Mr Romney would hope to broaden Mr Romney ' s appeal beyond non - Hispanic white voters - or at least soften the party' s image among independent voters. Mr Jindal is a die - hard social conservative and is leading the Republican governors ' charge against President Barack Obama' s healthcare reform law. Those attributes could win Mr Romney support on the Republican right - wing. Mr Jindal is also fiercely intelligent, attending Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar. Mr Jindal' s first foray into national politics fell flat - Mr Jindal ' s was chosen to give the Republican rebuttal to Mr Obama' s 2009 State of the Union address - and Mr Jindal ' s was dismissed as not quite ready for prime - time. Mr Jindal ' s national profile subsequently rose in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when Mr Jindal ' s positioned Mr Jindal ' s as a bold leader in dealing with the disaster and a critic of the Obama administration' s response. Before entering politics, Mr Jindal ' s worked briefly for consulting firm McKinsey and Company in Washington DC. While in Mr Jindal ' s mid - 20s Mr Jindal ' s was appointed to lead the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, and soon was running the national Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Under President George W Bush, Mr Jindal ' s was assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, and became governor in 2008. John Thune, 51, has been seen as a giant - killer by fellow Republicans since The two - term Senator ousted the Senate' s Democratic majority leader to claim The two - term Senator seat in the chamber in 2004. The two - term Senator has become a familiar face on US talk shows and is a prolific fundraiser within the party, using extra cash from The two - term Senator own coffers to bolster the campaigns of other Republican Senate candidates. Mr Thune' s staunchly conservative voting record, especially on social issues, could be an asset for Mr Romney, who has struggled to convince Mr Romney , who has struggled to convince his party ' s base that he is conservative enough for them party' s base that Mr Romney , who has struggled to convince his party ' s base that he is conservative enough for them is conservative enough for his party ' s base. In 2010 Mr Thune toyed with the idea of running for president Mr Thune ' s but ultimately decided not to, saying in February 2011 that Mr Thune ' s preferred to serve in the\" trenches\" of the Senate. Mr Thune is the son of a Norwegian immigrant and hails from Murdo, a small South Dakota town west of the Missouri River. Mr Thune ' s studied at Biola University in California and the University of South Dakota' s business school. Mr Thune ' s served in the House of Representatives from 1997 to 2003.",

The fingerprints of Anis Abid Sardar, from Wembley, London, were allegedly found on two other bombs at the scene, but not that which killed Sgt Johnson. Mr Sardar, 38, denies murder, conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the court:\" This is an unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence you will see and hear comes from Iraq.\" The Crown' s case is that the defendant Mr Sardar was directly involved in making bombs for use in Iraq during 2007.\" As you will hear, Anis Abid Sardar , from Wembley , London seems to have been based in Syria, probably in the capital city Damascus at relevant times.\" Prosecutor Max Hill QC explained that although the offences took place in Iraq, Mr Sardar is on trial in London as a British citizen. Mr Hill said the bombs\" were not off - the - shelf bombs, bombs for use in Iraq were made with deadly intent\". bombs for use in Iraq were later taken to an FBI laboratory in the US for examination by experts. Sgt Johnson, of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, was killed when the armoured vehicle Sgt Johnson , of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was travelling in hit a roadside improvised explosive device ( IED). Other US soldiers were seriously injured by the blast and also in a fire - fight while dealing with another IED, the court heard. Fingerprints found on the bomb that killed Sgt Johnson belonged to another man, Sajjad Adnan, who worked with Mr Sardar, the prosecution said. Mr Adnan, who is not British, was handed over to the Iraqi authorities after the bombings and another man , Sajjad Adnan , who worked with Mr Sardar current whereabouts are unknown, Mr Hill said. Jurors heard Mr Sardar was part of a group that left a number of IEDs buried under the roads west of Baghdad. The bomb that killed Sgt Johnson was part of a sequence, Mr Hill told the court,\" involving bombs concealed geographically quite close together\". Mr Hill said the bomb series was part of a\" joint effort by the defendant Mr Sardar, together with Adnan and others\".\" was is why it is unnecessary for Mr Sardar to have left Anis Abid Sardar , from Wembley , London own finger mark on the bomb which killed Sgt Johnson,\" Prosecutor Max Hill QC said. The prosecution made clear that This was an\" unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence... comes from Iraq.\" Nevertheless it is, according to The Crown ' s, lawful to try Anis Sardar here because Anis Abid Sardar , from Wembley , London is a British citizen who lives and works in London. It is the first time we have seen a prosecution in this country for charges of making improvised explosive devices ( IEDs) during the insurgency in Iraq. This has been a case a long time in gestation, since Mr Sardar was arrested seven years after the bombs were recovered from a dusty road west of Baghdad. The jury was told the bombs were forensically analysed by the US authorities in Iraq and America before being examined by British scientists. Though Mr Sardar claimed to have travelled to Syria in 2007 to learn Arabic, the court heard that police found documents in Mr Sardar London home which suggested Mr Sardar already had an advanced understanding of the language. Police searching the property also found a bomb - making manual written in Arabic. The US - led invasion of Iraq began in 2003, amid claims Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The US - led invasion of Iraq sparked years of violent conflict with different groups competing for power. British forces ended combat operations in 2009 and the US did so the following year.

As part of the deal to sell 24 - year - old De Gea to Real, United were planning to bring Costa Rica keeper Keylor Navas, 28, in the opposite direction. There is no precedent for Spanish clubs being given additional time to conclude transfers as there is in England. Blame for the failure to complete the deal is already being apportioned. Reports in Spain claim United were responsible for the deal collapsing. The line is United ' s did not get United ' s paperwork to Spanish Football Federation headquarters until a minute after the 23: 00 BST deadline. United say United ' s have a receipt that proves United ' s submitted the relevant documents in time. It remains to be seen whether Real will appeal to world governing body Fifa, which is responsible for sanctioning international transfers. The internet naturally had The internet say... And the tweets only intensified once stories of a technical glitch at the Madrid end began to surface... If Real Madrid don' t appeal, or do appeal and fail to push the transfer through, De Gea , who has not played for United this season' ll be back at Old Trafford competing for a place in the United starting line - up. Sergio Romero, the Argentina number one, has started all six of United' s games so far this season, with Sam Johnstone on the substitutes ' bench.

It' s been a rollercoaster week for the old, bitter enemies on each side of this debate. Last Wednesday - Budget day - there was quiet jubilation in hunts in England and Wales at the prospect of the loathed Hunting Act being relaxed. Dignity would be restored: hunts in England and Wales could hunt without hunts in England and Wales every move being filmed. Animal welfare groups were devastated: relaxed was a sneaky step, hunting would be back, and Animal welfare groups only had a week to mobilise. Now with the abandonment of the vote, Animal welfare groups fortunes have apparently been reversed. But this isn' t a tale of victory and defeat. Both sides now know the government' s desire to change the Hunting Act. the old , bitter enemies on each side of this debate are digging in for a much more protracted fight that could - believe it or not - become even more bitter. But the 56 SNP MPs, plus Labour and some Conservative MPs opposed to hunting, meant the government' s change stood little chance of being approved in Wednesday' s free vote. The SNP says The SNP will now consider tightening the law in Scotland to match England and Wales. Maria Eagle, Labour' s shadow environment secretary, said:\" David Cameron is now running scared because David Cameron knew David Cameron was going to lose the vote on fox - hunting.\" Meanwhile, a poll for the BBC' s Victoria Derbyshire show has suggested almost three in four British adults are against making fox hunting legal. The poll, conducted by ComRes, asked 1, 005 people if the practice\" should or should not be made legal again?\".",

In Guernsey, where Lord Amherst was governor for 24 years, a school, a road and a former hospital were named after Lord Amherst. However, in the US Lord Amherst has become a dubious figure because of Lord Amherst connection with biological warfare. Earlier this year students at liberal arts institution Amherst College, Massachusetts, voted to remove ' Lord Jeff ' as students at liberal arts institution Amherst College , Massachusetts unofficial mascot in light of accusations Lord Amherst approved the wiping out of Native Americans by deliberately giving Native Americans smallpox via infected blankets. As the commander - in - chief of the British army in pre - independence north America, Jeffery Amherst is said to have\" both despised and hated Lord Amherst enemy\" according to the historian Henry Morse Stephens. In a postscript to a fellow British officer Henry Bouquet, Lord Amherst appears to have written:\" a fellow British officer Henry Bouquet will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race.\" Lord Amherst should be very glad a fellow British officer Henry Bouquet scheme for hunting the Indians down by dogs could take effect, but England is at too great a distance to think of your scheme for hunting them down by dogs at present.\" Other higher education institutions including the University of Cape Town and Oxford University have faced student protests because of Other higher education institutions including the University of Cape Town and Oxford University association with another colonial figure, the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. The ' Rhodes Must Fall ' campaign led to UCT removing a statue of the 19th Century politician. Professor Elizabeth Fenn, an historian at the University of Colorado, who researched the Amherst smallpox incident told the BBC:\" Professor Elizabeth Fenn , an historian at the University of Colorado , who researched the Amherst smallpox incident am relieved and delighted to see the wholehearted rejection of Jeffery Amherst.\" Lord Amherst advocated genocide, the ' total erxtirpation ' of native peoples. The question we should ask is why did it take us so long?\" In Montreal more than 6, 500 people signed an online petition to rename the city' s Amherst Street after a former Premier of Quebec Jacques Parizeau, who died in 2015. The campaign, launched that year, continues. Some researchers have argued that the British general deserves an honourable position in history for Lord Amherst personal achievements, one of which was the capture of Montreal in 1760. Morse Stephens wrote:\" Though not a great man... Lord Amherst personal qualities were undeniable, and Lord Amherst could not have been an ordinary man to have risen from page to Duke of Dorset to be field - marshal commanding - in - chief.\" Whether Sir Jeffery Amherst ever visited Guernsey during Sir Jeffery Amherst time as governor of the island is not known, but Sir Jeffery Amherst legacy lives on today in several places; Amherst Primary School, Amherst Road and the Amherst Room at Castle Cornet. There was an Amherst Maternity Hospital in St Peter Port but the site was redeveloped for housing. Local historian, Colonel Richard Graham, said that Lord Amherst had been viewed as a national hero\" in whose reflected glory Guernsey bathed over the 24 years of Sir Jeffery Amherst time in office\". So have recent events overseas had any bearing on the general' s reputation in Guernsey? Mr Graham said historical figures like Jeffery Amherst should be judged by the standards of historical figures like Jeffery Amherst time.\" Local historian , Colonel Richard Graham believe strongly that historical figures like Jeffery Amherst should be judged and accepted by the mores of the time historical figures like Jeffery Amherst lived rather than by ours.\" In a hundred years ' time, our actions will be similarly scrutinised and there will be some judgemental souls who will see evil in stuff we currently regard as harmless.\" That is not to say that hideous conduct as seen in the evils of Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot are any the less hideous for having taken place when hideous conduct as seen in the evils of Hitler , Stalin and Pol Pot did and within the world as the world as it was was.\" But even these abominations need to be explained and understood as if from even these abominations time if the appropriate lessons are to be drawn from history.\" The island' s Education Department and a St Peter Port Parish official told the BBC that no one had approached The island ' s Education Department and a St Peter Port Parish official about renaming local places called Amherst.",

        "document": "Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65 % to 17 % majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have both made it clear The British and Irish governments don' t think now is the time to hold a border poll. Sinn Fein are campaigning for a poll and the DUP have discussed, in the DUP words, calling Sinn Fein' s bluff. But after weeks of controversy about flags and national identity, politicians ' claims about Catholic unionism, and a census showing a growing number identifying a growing number identifying themselves as Northern Irish as Northern Irish, what lies behind that headline figure in the Spotlight opinion poll is particularly revealing. Not surprisingly, more than 90 % of those who identify more than 90 % of those who identify themselves as Protestants as Protestants told the pollsters more than 90 % of those who identify themselves as Protestants wanted to stay in the UK. But on the other side of the religious divide, a substantial 38 % of Catholics also favoured remaining within the UK - three percentage points more than the number who backed a united Ireland. While only 5 % of Protestants don' t intend to vote or haven' t decided which option only 5 % of Protestants would pick, more than a quarter of Catholics are either undecided or not planning on voting. As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23 % - told the pollsters nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23 % - would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56 % - also said More than half of SDLP supporters - 56 % - would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland' s place within the union. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers these people\" Northern Irish\". considers posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified those who identified themselves as \" Northern Irish \" for the BBC Spotlight poll as\" Northern Irish\" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72 % to just 7 %. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that Peter Robinson party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make make a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97 % Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99 % Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99 % Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92 % Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51 % Protestant backing and 36 % Catholic support. Alliance' s support for a\" designated days\" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party' s offices and a death threat against Alliance , as an identifiably centre ground party only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44 % backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35 % wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10 % told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2 % opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73 % of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64 % of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made Belfast City Council decision in early December. This result may reflect some people' s belief in the right to protest, even if some people ' s don' t back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. more than three quarters of interviewees told the pollsters wanted was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business. Although the Stormont politicians might take heart from this shift of opinion, the protest organisers will point to the fact that by late January 45 % of unionists still believed the demonstrations should continue. believed shows a degree of resilience given the barrage of negative publicity generated by the protests. The poll was carried out for the BBC Spotlight programme by Ipsos Mori, whose researchers interviewed more than 1000 adults at 64 locations across Northern Ireland between 17 and 26 January. The full details are available as a pdf, 897kb in size. The full details include findings on how people rated individual politicians ' handling of the flags crisis, which parties those interviewed support and whether those surveyed believe the Stormont system favours one community over another.",

Adults with at least a college degree were also more likely to say Adults with at least a college degree received a raise in the last year, and more likely to say a raise exceeded the growth in Adults with at least a college degree expenses.\" The thing is that earnings are so highly correlated with education and employment,\" said Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank.\" It' s hard to imagine how a sense of financial wellbeing would not be correlated with education.\" Jobs in sectors that once supplied well - paid work for school leavers, such as manufacturing, have fallen. At the same time, the overall labour market has become more unstable as employers cut back on benefits and pay rises. The share of Americans in the workforce is also shrinking - particularly among those with lower levels of education, said Valerie Wilson, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute.\" The workers we would expect to have the strongest labour attachments have actually been becoming less attached,\" Valerie Wilson , an economist at the Economic Policy Institute said. Among survey respondents who did not attend college, nearly 40 % said college was too expensive or that nearly 40 % needed to earn money. nearly 40 % status was also closely tied to whether nearly 40 % parents had attended college. But Ms Baum said simply getting everyone to go to college is not the solution.\" There could be more work done to equalise things at the level of higher education but the problem is never going to be solved just at the college level,\" Ms Baum said.",

The violence is the first in Beirut since the conflict began in neighbouring Syria in March last year. The BBC' s Jim Muir in Beirut says the incident shows how divided the Lebanese are over the Syrian crisis. The clashes , between Sunni pro - and anti - Syrian groups follows a week of clashes in the northern city of Tripoli between anti - Syrian Sunnis and Alawites who support the regime of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad. Syrian and Lebanese politics have been deeply intertwined throughout the history of the two states. Syria, the dominant partner, had a large military presence in Lebanon for 29 years, finally withdrawing soldiers in 2005, but maintaining a strong influence. Political factions in Lebanon have often defined Political factions in Lebanon as pro - or anti - Syrian. By Jim MuirBBC News, Beirut. Given how deeply and sharply Lebanon is divided over Syria, it' s a miracle that there hasn' t been much more violence than there has. But the killing of two Sunni clerics at a Lebanese Army checkpoint in the north of the country on Sunday could hardly pass without consequence - though the fallout could have been much greater. Only in Beirut did the tension break into open conflict. And The clashes , between Sunni pro - and anti - Syrian groups was restricted to a clash between Sunni groups, with the mainstream Future faction of Saad al - Hariri using the occasion to squeeze out the small, pro - Syrian Arab Movement Party, whose leader Shaker Berjawi fled. In nearby areas of south Beirut, Hezbollah - the most powerful force in the land - kept well out of The clashes , between Sunni pro - and anti - Syrian groups. Political and religious leaders from all sides urged restraint, while the government pledged a vigorous enquiry into the death of the two shaikhs. Divisions over Syria are the defining issue in Lebanese politics. Everybody knows how real the danger is that the country would be torn apart if those differences are allowed to erupt freely onto the streets. Sunday' s violence was triggered by the shooting dead of two Sunni sheikhs linked to the anti - Syrian Future movement, headed by opposition leader Saad al - Hariri, at a Lebanese army checkpoint in the north on Sunday. Supporters of Mr Hariri responded by blocking main roads with burning car tyres, but security forces intervened to clear main roads. In Beirut' s southern district of Tariq al - Jadideh, offices of a local pro - Syrian leader came under attack by gunmen. Rocket - propelled grenades and machine - gun fire were heard for much of the night. But the clashes died away after the leader, Shaker Berjawi, left the area, and the Lebanese Army moved in. Sunni religious and political leaders have called for the utmost restraint, and an investigation has been launched into the killing of the two sheikhs.

The directive, which takes effect on 16 March, places a 90 - day ban on people from six mainly Muslim nations and a 120 - day ban on all refugees. The previous order, which was blocked by a federal court, sparked confusion at airports and mass protests.\" Nothing of substance has changed: There is the same blanket ban on entry from Muslim - majority countries ( minus one),\" Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said of the new order. the new version will bar entry of citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. Iraq, which was included in the first ban, has been taken off the list. Mr Chin also said the directive included\" the same sweeping shutdown of refugee admissions ( absent one exception) and lawless warren of exceptions and waivers\", despite the changes made. The new order lifts an indefinite ban on those from Syria. the new version will also no longer affect legal US permanent residents, and drops controversial language about giving priority to religious minorities. These amendments were introduced in response to legal complaints, which saw the first order blocked by US federal courts. Judges ruled that the ban was unconstitutional amid concerns the original ban unfairly targeted Muslims, something the government denied. Hawaii was among a number of states who filed lawsuits against the original ban saying the original ban would harm residents, businesses and schools. the Pacific island filed a fresh complaint late on Wednesday, calling for an emergency block on the new order. A hearing is set for March 15, a day before the new ban is to go into effect. President Trump has not yet commented on Hawaii' s latest legal bid, but has previously insisted President Trump has the right to enact such an executive order and hit out at\" so political\" courts. Speaking to local news channel Khon 2, Mr Chin said the new ban had the same\" nation - of - origin discrimination problems\" as the first. Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said this was a particularly sensitive issue in Hawaii because of memories of Japanese internment camps on the Pacific island during World War Two. Although the new directive sought to answer legal complaints, Mr Chin said the new version still constituted a\" Muslim ban\" because of the countries involved and statements from administration officials. In justifying the ban on Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said there are more than 300 refugees under investigation for potential terror offences. But no further details were given. The US appeals court previously criticised the government for failing to provide\" evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order\" had committed a terrorist attack in the US.",

Police have agreed the assault on Ben Pullar was\" not acceptable\" but said Police would not re - open the case. Mr Pullar is autistic and bi - polar, with severe learning difficulties, and when Mr Pullar was 18, Mr Pullar spent almost a year at Winterbourne View from July 2009. Mr Pullar lost two teeth when Mr Pullar was punched in the face. Mr Pullar twin, Tom, said Mr Pullar behaviour changed drastically after going to the hospital.\" Mr Pullar' s burst out crying on Tom Pullar and demanded to talk about Winterbourne View - and this is two years after Winterbourne View - so Winterbourne View still affects Mr Pullar today,\" said the 21 - year - old. The BBC has seen daily care notes from Mr Pullar time at the hospital which state Mr Pullar\" had an accident with Mr Pullar teeth\" just weeks after Mr Pullar arrived. Mr Pullar family said his family were given mixed messages about what happened and were told at one point Mr Pullar had\" bitten the floor\". Mr Pullar was taken to Bristol Dental Hospital by Winterbourne View staff as an emergency patient, and two doctors there raised the alarm with the authorities because of the severity of Mr Pullar injuries. Senior dental consultant Dr Jane Luker said:\" Senior dental consultant Dr Jane Luker think they thought the injury Mr Pullar sustained wasn' t consistent with what they were being told.\" Mr Pullar had allegedly bitten a carer and the injuries were sustained from Mr Pullar biting that carer.\" [ But] because the teeth were pushed back palatally, towards the back of the mouth, it would be consistent with a punch or a blow to the front of the face.\" The authorities met several days after Mr Pullar was assaulted, but Mr Pullar family was not invited. Tom Pullar said:\" Tom Pullar think that care staff are supposed to care for patients, not punch patients.\" Notes obtained by Inside Out said the nurse was bitten and retaliated in order to remove The nurse involved , Maxwell Nyamukapa fingers - and later, that The nurse involved , Maxwell Nyamukapa had pushed and pulled to get his fingers out.

APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after APC leader Muhammadu Buhari defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP' s decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday' s elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC' s Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice - President Namadi Sambo. the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram' s insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria' s oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south - east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja. The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once - powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south - east and the oil - rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria' s commercial hub, Lagos, in the south - west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria' s five oil - producing states. failed will be of huge concern to President - elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much - needed oil revenue. It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria' s democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari' s historic victory. Nigeria' s 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil - producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission ( Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. retained means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi - party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild the PDP under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, Our correspondent says. the PDP had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during the PDP rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist - led insurgency in the north - east where the PDP suffered huge defeats.",

Teaching unions have accused Ofqual of\" regulatory failure\" and say measures to guard against grade inflation is more evidence of flawed exam marking. But the regulator insists Ofqual ' s applied Ofqual ' s measures correctly. measures to guard against grade inflation comes as state and private school heads call for an independent inquiry into the problems. Last week Ofqual said Ofqual ' s felt the way this year' s English GCSE exams were graded was fair, despite the grade boundaries being moved significantly part - way through the year. Teachers have complained that pupils achieving exactly the same marks would have received different grades depending on what time of year pupils achieving exactly the same marks sat the exam. And many who were predicted a grade C, obtained a grade D in many who were predicted a grade C summer exams. Ofqual found that June' s grade boundaries were correct, while January' s were\" too lenient\". A key document sent to exam boards, which is on the Ofqual website, sets out how Ofqual ' s expects exam boards to use a process known as\" comparable outcomes\" to ensure that grade standards are maintained between GCSEs year - on - year. A key document sent to exam boards , which is on the Ofqual website sets out five conditions for when such processes should be used to alter the way papers are marked. According to the TES report, this year' s English GCSE and the circumstances around this year ' s English GCSE failed to meet four of the conditions. The first of Ofqual' s five conditions was that the cohort - or pupils from that year - in a subject\" must be similar, in terms of ability, to those of previous years\". But last week' s report on English GCSEs noted that the\" attainment profile\" for 2012 dropped, as grammar and independent school pupils were replaced with extra, lower - achieving comprehensive pupils. The second condition was that the qualification must be\" fit for purpose\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament that this year' s English GCSE was\" not fit for purpose\". The third condition was that the\" nature of the qualification\" must be the same. Ofqual' s report last week stated that\" these qualifications are different from previous English qualifications in a number of ways\". Finally, the regulator said in the letter that comparable outcomes must only be applied where\" previous grades were appropriate\". Ofqual' s report said that the English GCSE grades in January were\" too generous\". The only condition that appears to have been met is that teaching standards have remained largely consistent. The guidelines also state:\" Students should not be advantaged or disadvantaged simply because Students were the first to sit a new set of examinations.\" The watchdog has interpreted Ofqual ' s own conditions differently, and is insisting that the comparable outcomes approach that prevented grades from rising in June was correctly implemented. But Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT heads ' union, said:\" Ofqual doesn' t seem to have applied the concept of comparable outcomes properly.\" In this instance there is a regulatory failure. It is a big mess.\" And Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders ( ASCL) said this appeared to be\" another piece of evidence that procedures applied to this exam was not fit for purpose\". Meanwhile, Ofqual said:\" The comparable outcomes approach was used correctly for GCSE English this year and Ofqual ' s stand by this decision.\" Comparable outcomes are not intended to produce identical results year on year.\" What' s important is that outcomes can be compared when taking into consideration a range of factors which may affect the results. More details on the use of this approach can be found in our report.\" But Dr Christopher Ray, chairman of the Head Masters ' and Headmistresses ' Conference ( HMC), said the issue was evidence of a deeper problem with Ofqual.\" The verdict of Ofqual' s initial report and the reasoning to support The verdict of Ofqual ' s initial report fall well short of answering the questions raised in the minds of schools and pupils.\" Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said:\" It is clear that pupils, parents and education professionals, across the spectrum of schools, feel that pupils have been done a disservice.\" Whilst the Education Secretary Michael Gove says the Education Secretary Michael Gove is ' saddened ' by the injustice that has been served to thousands of pupils, the Education Secretary Michael Gove is showing how out - of - touch the Education Secretary Michael Gove is with pupil opinion by refusing to take action.

        "document": "Mr Hamilton has sent a business case to Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir outlying how Mr Hamilton intends to tackle the projected £ 490m overspend. The scheme was set up by former first minister Arlene Mrs Foster in 2012 when former first minister Arlene Mrs Foster was enterprise minister. RHI aim was to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses received more in subsidies than businesses paid for fuel, and the scheme became heavily oversubscribed. The plan by the economy minister has now been formally submitted to the Department of Finance for approval. Mr Hamilton and Mr Ó Muilleoir held talks on the issue last week. Analysis: BBC News NI' s Business Correspondent Julian O ' Neill. The BBC understands the plan involves a two - staged approach. First, the plan would reduce the tariffs paid to around 1, 800 people who got into the scheme before November 2015. reduce would require an Assembly vote to change the tariffs from the new financial year starting in April. Secondly, there would be a public consultation on a longer - term solution. But there remains an acceptance within the Department for the Economy that any moves on tariffs could face a legal challenge. It is understood that a significant number of RHI recipients have told the Department for the Economy a significant number of RHI recipients do not wish a significant number of RHI recipients names made public. The department had written to a significant number of RHI recipients asking for views on a significant number of RHI recipients names being released. Mrs Foster and Mr Hamilton have talked of wanting transparency about who benefited. It is believed the department is taking legal advice on the Department for the Economy options. The failure of the political parties to find a resolution on how to investigate the failings in the scheme has led to a political crisis at Stormont. Martin McGuinness resigned on Monday as deputy first minister in protest against the botched handling of the scheme and, after Mrs Foster refused to step aside while an investigation was held. Under Northern Ireland' s power - sharing agreement, Mrs Foster loses former first minister Arlene Mrs Foster first minister role with the departure of Mr McGuinness. The Sinn Féin MLA' s decision to quit is likely to lead to a snap election. The party has seven days to nominate a new deputy first minister, but is adamant Sinn Féin will not replace Mr McGuinness. If Sinn Féin chooses not to, then the baton would pass to Secretary of State James Brokenshire who would be legally obliged to call an election. In an effort to avert such a move, the British and Irish governments have pledged to do what the British and Irish governments can to resolve the crisis.",

And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because the unit frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital' s medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care.

In 2012, Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust admitted staff negligence. At London' s High Court earlier it was ruled the trust will pay a tax - free sum every year for the rest of Ayla' s life. Mr Justice Warby ruled the organisation must pay an index - linked amount starting at £ 225, 000 and rising to £ 290, 000 when Ayla Ellison , of Ulverston , Cumbria turns 18.

        "document": "Most incidents came during the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union battled for influence across the continent. CIA covert operations are by CIA covert operations very nature hard to prove definitively. But research into the agency' s work, as well as revelations by former CIA employees, has thrown up several cases where the agency tried to influence events. Here are four examples:. Patrice Lumumba became the first prime minister of the newly - independent Congo in 1960, but Patrice Lumumba lasted just a few months in the job before Patrice Lumumba was overthrown and assassinated in January 1961. In 2002, former colonial power Belgium admitted responsibility for former colonial power Belgium part in the killing, however, the US has never explained the US role despite long - held suspicions. US President Dwight D Eisenhower, concerned about communism, was worried about Congo following a similar path to Cuba. According to a source quoted in Death in the Congo, a book about the assassination, President Eisenhower gave\" an order for the assassination of Lumumba. There was no discussion; the [ National Security Council] meeting simply moved on\". However, a CIA plan to lace Lumumba' s toothpaste with poison was never carried out, Lawrence Devlin, who was a station chief in Congo at the time, told the BBC in 2000. A survey of declassified US government documents from the era notes that the CIA\" initially focussed on removing Lumumba, not only through assassination if necessary but also with an array of non - lethal undertakings\". While there is no doubt the CIA wanted Patrice Lumumba dead, the survey does not indicate direct US involvement in Patrice Lumumba eventual killing. Ghana' s first President Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown in a military coup in 1966 while Ghana ' s first President Kwame Nkrumah was out of the country. Ghana ' s first President Kwame Nkrumah later suspected that the US had a role in Ghana ' s first President Kwame Nkrumah downfall and in a 1978 book, former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell backed this theory up. In In Search of Enemies former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell writes that an official sanction for the coup does not appear in CIA documents, but former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell writes\" the Accra station was nevertheless encouraged by headquarters to maintain contact with dissidents.\" the Accra station was given a generous budget, and maintained intimate contact with the plotters as a coup was hatched.\" former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell says that the CIA in Ghana got more involved and the CIA in Ghana operatives were given\" unofficial credit for the eventual coup\". A declassified US government document does show awareness of a plot to overthrow the president, but does not indicate any official backing. Another declassified document written after the coup describes Nkrumah' s fall as a\" fortuitous windfall. Nkrumah was doing more to undermine our interests than any other black African\". In Angola three competing groups fought for control after independence from Portugal in 1975, with the MPLA under Agostinho Neto taking over the capital Luanda. Mr Stockwell, chief of CIA' s covert operations in Angola in 1975, writes that Washington decided to oppose the MPLA, as the MPLA under Agostinho Neto was seen as closer to the Soviet Union, and support the FNLA and Unita instead, even though all three had help from communist countries. The CIA then helped secretly import weapons, including 30, 000 rifles, through Kinshasa in neighbouring Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr Stockwell says in a video documentary. Mr Stockwell , chief of CIA ' s covert operations in Angola in 1975 adds that CIA officers also trained fighters for armed combat. A declassified US government document detailing a discussion between the head of the CIA, the secretary of state and others indicates the support the CIA gave to the forces fighting the MPLA. The US continued to support Unita through much of the civil war as Cuba was backing the MPLA. Hissene Habre failed in Hissene Habre attempt to take power by force in Chad in 1980. But Hissene Habre efforts led President Goukouni Oueddei to call on help from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose soldiers successfully beat back Habre' s challenge and forced Hissene Habre into exile. A proposed alliance between Libya and Chad began to unsettle the US especially as Gaddafi began to be seen as a supporter of anti - US activities. In Foreign Policy magazine Michael Bronner writes that the CIA director, with the secretary of state,\" coalesced around the idea of launching a covert war in partnership with Habre\". It is alleged that the US then backed Habre' s overthrow of the president in 1982 and then supported Hissene Habre throughout Hissene Habre brutal rule.",

        "document": "Across the world, drug laws are being relaxed, from Uruguay to Portugal, Jamaica and the Czech Republic. Does relaxed mean the war on drugs has been lost? The BBC World Service' s The Inquiry hears from four expert witnesses, including a former Colombian president and a drugs prosecutor turned defence lawyer. After many years prosecuting drugs offences as an Assistant US Attorney, growing frustration with the approach inspired Bonny Klapper to become a defence attorney.\" About 10 years into Bonny Klapper career, it really hit Bonny Klapper that the people Bonny Klapper was prosecuting were not just drug traffickers. these individuals were mothers, these individuals were fathers, and Bonny Klapper really began to take an interest in why these individuals got involved in drug trafficking.\" One Colombian drug runner had a big impact:.\" At 14 One Colombian drug runner had a choice: go work in the emerald mines, or do something else. So One Colombian drug runner started in the emerald mines, and started was a horrible experience. And then One Colombian drug runner was offered the chance to work as a driver for one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Cartel. One Colombian drug runner started as a driver, and ultimately rose up through the ranks.\" In countries like Colombia, sometimes if you want to support your family - and you don' t come from a wealthy family or you' re not highly educated - drugs is the only path that you have to get yourself out of poverty.\" Bonny Klapper noticed other problems back in the US at the other end of the chain:.\" [ [ We] would prosecute money remitter houses in Queens that were sending drug money to Colombia. [ We prosecuted one, [ We shut one down, and the next day another one opened up in the same location. Or [ We prosecuted very high level traffickers, either in the US or in Colombia, and once very high level traffickers were extradited, someone else came in to take very high level traffickers place.\" We' ve shifted the problem from Colombia to Mexico. Now all of Central America is inundated because the traffickers got sophisticated, and the traffickers' re moving through Guatemala and Honduras, and those countries are turning into narco states.\" Bonny Klapper argues the approach to drugs users is equally flawed:.\" The prison system is a disaster. There' s virtually no rehabilitation. Locking up low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options is not effective, because low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options go to jail, low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options come out, low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options get involved with drugs again, and low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options go right back to it. \" I have nothing but praise for the law enforcement agents I' ve worked with [ but] so many of the law enforcement agents I ' ve worked with have said to I ' the law enforcement agents I ' ve worked with' re fighting a war that can' t be won the way the law enforcement agents I ' ve worked with' re fighting a war that can ' t be won the way we ' re fighting it '.\" The war a war that can ' t be won the way we ' re fighting it is at a draw. And I believe that draw will be maintained indefinitely unless there' s a dramatic change in our approach to drugs and drug trafficking.\" Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria worked on the Global Commission on Drug Policy report in 2011 which called on states to decriminalise drugs.\" Our recommendation is regulation for everything. regulation for everything' s what Portugal did.\" If you look at the last 50 years, what has been done? In the US, 600, 000 people in jail, $ 40bn ( Â £ 27bn) of spending a year. The highest rates of consumption of the whole world. You have to say that it doesn' t work. it' s a failed policy, and public opinion knows that.\" Ten years ago it was unthinkable that the US would move massively to the legalisation of cannabis.\" That taboo has been broken. In the US, a majority of people are talking about approving legalisation of marijuana.\" Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria cites the example of Uruguay, the first country to legalise the marijuana trade.\" All Latin America' s looking at Uruguay. Uruguay , the first country to legalise the marijuana trade' s a country that also looks how to deal with the production, with the supply of the marijuana that is in the state hands.\" Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria don' t expect any major set back of the policy that the Uruguayans have put in place.\" From the beginning in 1961, the objective of the UN Conventions has been to live in a world free of drugs, but a world free of drugs' s a utopia. a world free of drugs' s something unreachable. It' s not to recognise human nature.\" Former chief scientist in the White House Office of National Drug Policy Control David Murray insists the billions of dollars spent tackling drug traffickers and destroying coca crops were well spent:.\" A 75 % reduction in the productive capacity of Colombian cocaine was achieved by strategic initiatives of supply reduction in partnership with the leadership and political will of the Colombians the Colombians themselves.\" A 75 % reduction in the productive capacity of Colombian cocaine' s been a sustained achievement that then resulted in a more than 45 % drop in the prevalence rate of cocaine use in the United States on the streets.\" This is a global business. As a global business This have This preferred mode of operation where This would like to be with regard to supply routes - ungoverned safe havens where This would like to be to carry out This business with maximum efficiency. \" When you push them off of that spot them will adapt but them are diminished.\" We may have an idealised world where prevention and treatment and recovery happen in a certain way and we don' t have to do the hard and dirty work, but an idealised world where prevention and treatment and recovery happen in a certain way and we don ' t have to do the hard and dirty work' s not the reality on the ground.\" The reality is it' s a tough slog, it is a cancer and it is worth fighting. Sure it' s discouraging to see drug use continue but drug use actually is diminished if you take a long perspective over time and we actually are making progress with regard to drug use.\" Professor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland has been a leading academic in the field of drugs policy for decades.\" The war on drugs was partly defined by the war itself rhetoric.\" The need for national leaders to stand up and talk about the scourge of drugs, and signal to the population that [ being tough on drugs] was a priority was an important part of the war the war itself.\" There' s going to be less and less of The need for national leaders to stand up and talk about the scourge of drugs , and signal to the population that [ being tough on drugs ] was a priority. Professor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland think there' s going to be a change both in tone and substance, so the ' war on drugs ' will become a less and less plausible metaphor for describing policy. Professor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland think the war itself' s going to be a public health rhetoric for the foreseeable future.\" Professor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland do believe that we have in a sense had an experiment with trying to be very aggressive about controlling drugs through use of prohibition. And we have a sense that trying did not work well. And so we' re now trying to find better ways of managing the problem, and Professor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland think trying' s welcome.\" If you look at the number of people who are in prison for drug offences, at least in the US, the number of people who are in prison for drug offences , at least in the US' s an important indicator of the change in real policy, and those numbers are starting to go down. Not dramatically, but the number of people who are in prison for drug offences , at least in the US are definitely going down, and many states are making changes that are likely to accelerate that decline.\" As drug laws soften Professor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland argues the question of regulation becomes key, as happened when gambling was legalised:.\" Lottery play was always seen as a bad thing, you legalised Lottery play because you wanted to take money away from organised crime, but the result was that the state lotteries became the most aggressive promoters. The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service, Tuesdays from 13: 05 GMT. Listen to the programme. Download the programme.\" You have slogans like ' Why be a mug and work when you can play the lottery and win easily? ', just the kind of slogan you' d associate with the worst commercial promotion, but done by the state.\" Alcohol is still heavily promoted, and Alcohol' s promoted in states that have state liquor monopolies, and we' ve only recently really been able to restrict smoking promotions.\" So I think there' s considerable risk that even if there was a monopoly there would be promotion of marijuana, and clearly what we see in the state of Colorado where marijuana is commercially available, marijuana' s regulated, like alcohol, what we see is very aggressive promotion, advertising.\" You cannot with a straight face say that marijuana legalisation won' t lead to more marijuana dependence.\" Choose your problem. There is no solution. Use of psychoactive drugs is a social problem like a whole lot of other social problems. We manage Use of psychoactive drugs. And We may manage Use of psychoactive drugs better or worse, but the notion that We solve a problem is simplistic.

Wright , 53' s in the process of clinching a deal to replace Swanson in time for the European signing deadline but the Scobbie departure has been a bit of a shock and the Scobbie departure comes at a time when fellow defender Brian Easton is being treated for a groin problem. \" There is a risk Brian may miss Europe and a risk Brian may miss Europe certainly leaves St Johnstone short in terms of a left - back,\" said the Northern Irishman.\" the Northern Irishman wanted Thomas { Scobbie} re - signed. the Northern Irishman know Thomas { Scobbie } was more than happy to stay, but something' s happened that signed' s fallen through so the Northern Irishman' ve got to deal with fallen.\" It' s part of management, you don' t always get what you want and now St Johnstone' ve got to move on and do the best for the club. the Northern Irishman' m now putting all the Northern Irishman efforts in to get a left - back to be cover for losing Thomas.\" Wright drew praise for the Northern Irishman handling of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster as Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster left the pitch at half - time in the match with Hamilton. But the manager says that incident on 1 April was one of the toughest tests of the Northern Irishman managerial career.\" the Northern Irishman didn' t see the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half - time in the match with Hamilton and still haven' t seen the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half - time in the match with Hamilton because there' s no footage of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half - time in the match with Hamilton, which is a miracle these days,\" the Northern Irishman said.\" Immediately after the game, when the Northern Irishman' m hearing what' s allegedly happened, there was one thought in the Northern Irishman head: that the two of them can go, Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster' re out, Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster' re sacked.\" But then it was time for calm heads and leadership from the club and the Northern Irishman. The lads very quickly helped the situation by admitting Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster were wrong, Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster were remorseful.\" So come the Saturday night Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster definitely weren' t going to be sacked, but the chairman and the Northern Irishman felt that for the image of the club the chairman and I' d deal with the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half - time in the match with Hamilton as severely and as quickly as the chairman and I could ( with a fine and reprimand).\" the chairman and I were honest with the players, in terms of how the chairman and I felt Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster had let not only Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster down, but the club and Scottish football as a whole.\" The timing of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team - mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half - time in the match with Hamilton could have derailed our season. St Johnstone actually lost the game 1 - 0, losing a goal in the 91st minute after doing brilliantly with nine men and lost was gut - wrenching for the players.\" Wright feels that by beating Hearts with a weakened squad and then Inverness in Saints ' next two games, St Johnstone showed the benefit of\" having good people and a good squad\".

Mr Modi is here to make sure the technology developed here continues to do so for decades to come, but perhaps now with more benefit to those back home. Mr Modi ' s visit, which was welcomed by more than 20, 000 expats on Sunday evening at a stadium reception in San Jose, comes at a time when Indian and Indian - American success in Silicon Valley is truly formidable. There' s the charismatic Satya Nadella in charge at Microsoft. There' s the 10 - year - strong reign of Shantanu Narayen at the top of Adobe. And more recently, Sundar Pichai took over as chief executive of Google - a role many said had been years coming. Indians in California say it' s the blend of temperament and competitive spirit that brings success Indians in California way.\" If an old school friend starts a company in Silicon Valley,\" one Valley - based Indian tech executive, Mohit Aron, told me,\" one Valley - based Indian tech executive , Mohit Aron' m going to start an even better one\". Mr Modi continues to ride the strong waves of support back home. A recent US think - tank study suggests 87 % of Indians have\" favourable opinions\" of the leader. Outside the stadium, that enthusiasm was on full display - though not without the accompaniment of a strong protest against Mr Modi ' s government. Those not on\" Team Modi\" are angry at what Those not on \" Team Modi \" see as ignorance towards Mr Modi' s past. In particular, Those not on \" Team Modi \" say Mr Modi ' s did little to prevent the killing of Muslims in the Gujarat riots in 2002. And when it comes to Digital India, Mr Modi' s plans to get a billion more Indians on the internet, Those not on \" Team Modi \" say Digital India , Mr Modi ' s plans to get a billion more Indians on the internet' s a front to mass surveillance. A letter, signed by more than 100 academics in Silicon Valley ahead of Mr Modi' s visit, backed up this concern. more than 100 academics in Silicon Valley ahead of Mr Modi ' s visit believe the positivity around Mr Modi ' s leadership, particularly in the Indian press, is more to do with aggression from the government towards the government critics. Yet the support for Mr Modi in the US appeared genuine - and its Mr Modi ' s tech - savvy attitude to communicating that seems to impress people most.\" We' re very proud,\" said one supporter outside the stadium. The SAP Center is in San Jose, a city that sits at the bottom of Silicon Valley, a region where Indians truly thrive. Some 26 % of tech companies here are founded or run by Indians and Indian Americans. Some 26 % of tech companies here' s more than the next five immigrant groups combined. Mr Modi has come here on a mission to bring some of that success, and wealth, back to India. To do it, Mr Modi ' s needs help. Before India can even begin to think of India as a genuinely major technology player, India needs to cover the basics. Mr Modi, effortlessly adopting Silicon Valley' s obsession with buzzwords, said the country needs both highways and\" i - ways\", by which Mr Modi ' s meant fibre internet, connecting each and every Indian town and village. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Modi spent time with someone who could help, taking part in a Q & A with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. a Q & A with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was decidedly more A than Q, mind, as of 40, 000 questions submitted to Mr Modi, only three were asked during the session. only three covered the rewards of getting online, particularly when it comes to creating jobs. Mr Modi spoke of Mr Modi ' s delight at Mr Modi ' s tweets and messages to other world leaders\" going viral\". The last question, from Mr Zuckerberg, asked about Mr Modi' s relationship with Mr Modi ' s mother. Pausing, Mr Modi became emotional as Mr Modi ' s told of cleaning dishes for those less fortunate. The prime minister even appeared to cry. An elderly Indian lady later told Dave Lee it made An elderly Indian lady feel like Mr Modi ' s was\" just like us\". Those who see Mr Modi less favourably say that was exactly its intention, a staged display designed to build Mr Modi ' s reputation as a man of the people. The meeting at Facebook was mutually beneficial. Mr Zuckerberg, keen as ever to expand Facebook' s user base and global influence, talked up the prospect of connecting a billion more Indians to the internet. In one of the most pointed exchanges in the entire session, Mr Modi said Mr Modi ' s hoped Mr Zuckerberg' s motivations weren' t purely about Facebook' s bank balance. For Mr Modi, this entire Silicon Valley visit is a chance to put a little pressure on the tech giants. Mr Modi ' s wants India to graduate from being home to the low - end of the tech trade - call centres and cheap labour - and instead an attractive place to start a technology business. Indeed, Mr Modi ' s wants India to be a great place to start any kind of business, and reverse the trend of great minds, particularly in tech, heading to California.

Vine don' t know Dear Romford 15 - year - old , who I ' ll call Ben . name, and it' s good that Vine don' t, because Vine am sure Dear Romford 15 - year - old , who I ' ll call Ben . do not want to be associated with that video of the bullies savagely punching Dear Romford 15 - year - old , who I ' ll call Ben . to the ground. Bullies? They are worse than that. Vine was really shocked by what Vine saw. Loads of people were disgusted. Dear Romford 15 - year - old , who I ' ll call Ben . are just 15. Ben, something similar happened to Vine. Vine was a sensitive young teen, always trying and failing to be coolâ € ¦ never athletic enough, never hip enough, a late developer, crazy hair, with uncool parents who thought church was the main event. Vine worshipped indie bands - Joy Division especially - in the way that sensitive souls do. Vine wanted to be a jock, but Vine was a nerd. Maybe Dear Romford 15 - year - old , who I ' ll call Ben . recognise was. One day Vine was at a party and spoke to a girl. Apparently a girl was the girlfriend of someone important. someone important sent someone important friend to beat Vine up. The friend said:\" Excuse his friend, can his friend tell Vine something?\" And because his friend was shorter than Vine Vine had to lean down to hear his friend. Having moved Vine head within range, his friend punched Vine as hard as Dear Romford 15 - year - old , who I ' ll call Ben . got punched. Vine had never been hit before. The shock was unbelievable - violence does that. Vine went down immediately just like Dear Romford 15 - year - old , who I ' ll call Ben .. Vine mates, also sensitive souls, were too scared to help. My mates , also sensitive souls were gutted afterwards. You feel humiliated. Your pride is hurt, your head is hurt - Vine had a gigantic black eye. A person can get very down over a beating. Some people think depression evolved in us as a way of keeping us safe if us lose a fight - the mind and body working together to prevent you re - entering the conflict for your own safety. It took Vine ages before Vine wasn' t scared of being hit again. You look over your shoulder for a while, and you feel a primal fear. feel is natural, Ben. So Vine watched Dear Romford 15 - year - old , who I ' ll call Ben . video and saw Vine. That guy who distracted Vine in 1980 could be the thug who hit Dear Romford 15 - year - old , who I ' ll call Ben . from behind in 2016 - such a coward. Can Vine give Dear Romford 15 - year - old , who I ' ll call Ben . some advice? Don' t think Dear Romford 15 - year - old , who I ' ll call Ben . have to be hard like the bullies. I tried to be a tough teenager afterwards and closed I off like a drum. I reacted to nothing and felt nothing. Then I got to university and found people like I who would never dream of punching someone, and I life opened up like a flower. A kind lecturer was shocked when I proudly and foolishly told A kind lecturer I had never read a poem. A kind lecturer said,\" We' ll change that,\" and helped I understand the power of poetry. One day in I student room I read a poem and cried. I was alive again. Sure, I would never win a fight - I have never hit anyone in I life - but you don' t need to hit people to succeed in your life. Quite the opposite. The courts will decide who assaulted you and how to punish them. In our society, what happened to you is thankfully now taken very seriously. But let I tell you something about the lads in the video. In 20 years, when you' re with the person you love and hopefully in a career you have a passion for, the lads in the video will still be scumbags. the lads in the video cupboards will smell of gym sweat and cheeseburgers. Each will own one suit which Each wore to the funeral of a friend who died doing a wheelie on a motorway - by the way, the lads in the video wore the same baffled expression at the funeral service. the lads in the video' ve gone from making the weather to being rained on, and the lads in the video complain about being constantly. the lads in the video are not something anyone wants to be with - the lads in the video lives are already over. Five per cent of people are good at fighting. I' m not one and nor are you. It is very important we let the 5 % fight each other. Live by the sword, die by the sword: the thug who beat I up was in hospital the thug who beat me up a year later after someone broke a bottle across the thug who beat me up face. Meanwhile, you and I can read poetry and listen to our favourite bands, and if you and I sometimes cry, there is no shame in cry. To cry is to live. The people who attacked you are the walking dead.

        "document": "Under US law, 40 % of the corn harvest must be used to make biofuel, a quota which the UN says could contribute to a food crisis around the world. A drought and heatwave across the US has destroyed much of the country' s corn crop, driving up prices. The US argues that producing much of the US own fuel, rather than importing much of its own fuel, is good for the country. The latest forecasts from the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA) suggest that this year' s corn yield - the amount produced per acre - will be the lowest since 1995 - 6. Total production will be the lowest for six years, the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) forecast, due to the extreme heat and dryness. As a result, the USDA is predicting further rises in prices. the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) now thinks farm prices for corn will average $ 7. 50 - $ 8. 90 per bushel, a sharp rise on the $ 5. 40 - $ 6. 40 per bushel the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) predicted just a month ago. By Mark MardellNorth America editor. Writing in the Financial Times, the director general of the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO), Jose Graziano da Silva, said suspension of the quota would allow more of the crop to be diverted for food production.\" The worst drought for 50 years is inflicting huge damage on the US maize crop, with serious consequences for the overall international food supply.\" The situation reminds us that even the most advanced agricultural systems are subject to the vagaries of the weather, leading to volatility in supplies and prices, not just on domestic markets, but also internationally.\" Concerns about the impact of the dry weather in the US pushed maize prices up by 23 % in July, according to the latest FAO food price index. But the US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the biofuels standard was having a positive impact on the country.\" the law is impacting in a positive way the cost of gasoline in this country - some estimates put it at 25 cents to as much as $ 1. 30 less for gas because the US have a biofuel industry.\" There are jobs connected to that industry and less reliance on foreign oil. The question is: Is the market responding to concerns about supply and the answer is yes.\" Exports are down just a bit and ethanol production is down from between 10 % and 30 %, depending on the part of the country.\" By law, 13 billion gallons of biofuel must be produced in the US this year. The country' s Renewable Fuel Standard, as the law is known, was designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on imported oil. the quota has long been controversial, with many blaming the quota for pushing up corn prices. The United Nations is not alone in calling for the quota to be suspended. Livestock producers in the US, worried about the cost of cattle feed, also want the quota scrapped and the governments of China, India and France have expressed concerns about the policy.",

But Nadia Nadim nodded Denmark level after half - time and Theresa Nielsen' s late header completed the comeback. It is only Germany' s third loss in the 26 - year history of the competition. The Olympic champions - ranked second in the world - created plenty of chances but were also frequently opened up at the back by a Denmark side who, after a nervy start, became increasingly dangerous. The opener came courtesy of a goalkeeping error, as Stina Lykke Petersen misjudged Kerschowski' s fierce shot from the edge of the area and could only parry the German' s shot in to the net. After the break, Germany hesitated when Germany thought Germany had conceded a free - kick only for the referee to play an advantage that Denmark took, with Portland Thorns forward Nadim jumping well at the far post to nod in the equaliser. Plenty of openings for both sides followed as the game became stretched with the prospect of extra time looming. Another right - wing cross found Nielsen unmarked in the Germany penalty area on 83 minutes and Theresa Nielsen ( Denmark Women ) headed in to spark wild Danish celebrations. The result guaranteed that the tournament will have a different winner for the first time since Norway' s triumph in 1993, with Germany having won the following six European Championships.

Failure to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League was an early - season blow, and a winless run in the Europa League did little to appease the Celtic support. Then came a League Cup semi - final defeat to Ross County and, most painfully of all, a Scottish Cup loss at the same stage to bitter rivals Rangers. These factors combined left manager Ronny Deila feeling manager Ronny Deila had no option other than to step down at the end of the current campaign.\" Celtic ' s were disappointing,\" admits Griffiths.\" The European campaign wasn' t great and the cup defeat against Rangers - everybody said a Scottish Cup loss at the same stage to bitter rivals Rangers was a disaster but you know Celtic ' s played one of our worst games of the season and Celtic ' s drew, but got beaten on penalties which we all know is just a lottery.\"\" { Players} could' ve been performing better, you know Celtic ' s' ve lost silly points in silly games. Celtic ' s were beaten twice by Aberdeen, Celtic ' s' ve drawn a couple of home games Celtic ' s didn' t score in but Celtic ' s still managed to wrap up a league title and wrap' s the most important thing.\" The list of potential candidates to succeed Deila is a long one. David Moyes, Paul Lambert, Malky Mackay, Michael O ' Neill, Brendan Rodgers, Neil Lennon, Roy Keane - just some of the names that have been linked with the soon - to - be - vacant Parkhead hotseat since Deila announced Deila would be exiting Parkhead in the summer. Griffiths has already paid tribute to the Norwegian for coaxing out of the Scotland international the best form of the Scotland international career, but says a new man in the dugout represents an opportunity for every player at Celtic.\" Everybody in the changing room is going to have a clean slate,\" said the Scotland international.\" There are players in the dressing room who will be in favour and others who won' t be in favour and it will be up to others who won ' t be in favour to work others who won ' t be in favour way back into the squad.\" the Scotland international' ve had a good season so far but a new manager coming in will have a new manager coming in own ideas - hopefully the Scotland international' m part of that plan.\" The football world has been captivated by the fairytale story of Leicester City defying the odds to become Premier League champions. Aberdeen did provide a challenge for the Premiership title, but the feeling among many was that Celtic, for all Celtic ' s shortcomings, would have too much strength in depth over the course of the season. So it has proved, and Griffiths is pleased that another Leicester - style underdog triumph has not unfolded in Scotland.\" As players Celtic ' s are delighted with what Leicester have achieved as it shows why football is the best sport in the world. But Celtic ' s don' t want any underdogs winning leagues up here, Celtic ' s want it to be Celtic ' s.\" Aberdeen may have run Celtic ' s close this year, but ultimately Celtic ' s want to be Scottish champions at the end of the year.\" Celtic can clinch the title with a point when the Dons visit Parkhead at the weekend.\" The boys are buzzing, Celtic ' s can' t wait to go out and confirm ourselves as champions on Sunday.\" Celtic ' s know there' s going to be a big crowd coming and Celtic ' s want to send the fans home happy. Hopefully it' s three points, Celtic ' s only need one, but Celtic ' s know Aberdeen will come down and make it difficult for Celtic ' s.\" Having established the Scotland international beyond doubt as Celtic' s leading forward, Griffiths ' next target is to gain the same status in the Scotland team. The former Hibs striker has seven caps to the Scotland international name, but has yet to establish the Scotland international in Gordon Strachan' s side, more often than not finding the Scotland international behind Steven Fletcher in the pecking order. Griffiths hopes the end - of - season friendly internationals against Italy on 29 May and France on 4 June will give Griffiths a chance to prove Griffiths worth before the 2018 World Cup qualifiers kick off with a trip to Malta in September.\" Griffiths' m just happy to be back in the squad now and if Griffiths get a start Griffiths' ll be buzzing, if not sit on that bench and wait Griffiths turn.\" We' ve got a lot of good strikers all vying for that one place. You' ve got to be playing well and in favour so hopefully come the World Cup qualifiers Griffiths' ll be that man.\"",

To no - one' s surprise, given the way the pair parted company after Mr Sarkozy lost the presidency in 2012, a book of recollections concerning the seven years he served as his top aide drips with the satisfaction of a finally requited revenge. Patrick Buisson - the man credited with inspiring his former boss ' s rightward shift on issues like national identity have known some acts of treachery in Patrick Buisson - the man credited with inspiring his former boss ' s rightward shift on issues like national identity time... but rarely like this\" In one passage, Mr Buisson claims that Nicolas Sarkozy deliberately allowed rioters from the suburbs to rampage in central Paris, the better to show off Nicolas Sarkozy capacity to restore order. It was in 2006, when Mr Sarkozy was at the interior ministry and Nicolas Sarkozy rival, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, was pushing through a labour reform hotly contested by French youth. Mr Buisson quotes Mr Sarkozy as recalling:\" We took the decision to allow gangs of blacks and Arabs to attack the young whites on the Invalides, and at the same time tipped off the photographers at Paris Match that there was likely to be serious trouble.\" We were petrified that someone might end up getting seriously hurt, but in the end it was worth it.\" At the demonstration that followed, police intervened early and Mr Sarkozy was on hand for the television cameras,\" proving how much Nicolas Sarkozy was in control of the situation compared with the prime minister\", writes Mr Buisson. The former adviser is scathing about Mr Sarkozy' s\" narcissistic\" personality, and says Nicolas Sarkozy public courtship and marriage to\" trophy woman\" Carla Bruni was an excruciating embarrassment.\" Probably Nicolas Sarkozy thought deep down that the happy news of Nicolas Sarkozy love life would be a useful antidote to the prevailing gloom. Instead [ the reaction] could be summed up in three words: immature, undignified, infantile.\" Patrick Buisson - the man credited with inspiring his former boss ' s rightward shift on issues like national identity is also unsparing of Carla Bruni Carla Bruni herself , who he says \" did deep harm to [ the Sarkozy ] presidency \", who Patrick Buisson - the man credited with inspiring his former boss ' s rightward shift on issues like national identity says\" did deep harm to [ the Sarkozy] presidency\".\" The head of state... was in reality a fragile seducer subjugated by Nicolas Sarkozy conquests, a fake tough guy submerged in a permanent state of emotional dependency.\" In politics, Mr Buisson says Nicolas Sarkozy was always words rather than action, that Nicolas Sarkozy lacked guiding principles and was more interested in the short - term buzz of media approval.\" The public man... was always constrained by the private man, by the private man passions, the private man confusions, the private man weakness for whatever was in vogue.\" The book reveals that the aspiring president was in contact with far - right National Front ( FN) leader Jean - Marie Le Pen between the two rounds of the 2007 election, which Nicolas Sarkozy won, in the hope of winning FN votes for round two. And in 2005 Mr Buisson quotes far - right National Front ( FN ) leader Jean - Marie Le Pen as saying:\" The values of the far right are the values of all the French. It' s just the way the FN puts The values of the far right that is shocking. The French do not like over - spicy food.\" Now fully engaged in November' s primary to choose the centre - right' s presidential candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy has dismissed Mr Buisson' s book as unworthy of notice. The two men fell out after the former president' s 2012 election defeat by Francois Hollande. Two years later it was revealed that throughout the Sarkozy presidency Mr Buisson had been secretly recording conversations and meetings at the Elysee. Speaking on television at the time, Mr Sarkozy said:\" Nicolas Sarkozy have known some acts of treachery in Nicolas Sarkozy time, but rarely like this!\" Mr Buisson was convicted of invasion of privacy and ordered to pay â ‚ ¬ 20, 000 ( Â £ 17, 000; $ 22, 000) in damages to Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni.

Six years ago, the Pakistani national had been living in the north - west English city where Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 plotted to kill hundreds in a bombing attack at the city centre' s Arndale shopping complex during Easter weekend. Naseer, who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013, was convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al - Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device. Defending Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 at Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 trial in New York, the 28 - year - old was polite, calm and professional. Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 denied Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 was involved in any form of extremism. But, according to the police officer who headed up the British investigation into Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 activities, Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 courtroom conduct was a performance designed to con the jury. In a cafe overlooking the Brooklyn courthouse where the trial was held, Det Supt Mark Smith said Naseer was a good actor, an al - Qaeda trained terrorist and a man with a determination to kill hundreds of people. Det Supt Mark Smith said:\" Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 has had lots of time to develop Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 Westernised social skills, but Det Supt Mark Smith would say don' t be fooled. Beneath that cool, relaxed exterior is a cold, calculated terrorist.\" Held in custody in the US ahead of Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 trial, Naseer had spent the months preparing Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 legal case and working out. One police officer commented that Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 had doubled in size since Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 was handcuffed and led away from a Cheetham Hill house in April 2009. Were it not for Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 arrest, detectives are convinced Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 would have gone ahead with a\" mass - casualty\" attack in Manchester city centre. Based upon intelligence gathered and the plots devised by other terrorists trained at the same al - Qaeda camp in Pakistan, police have pieced together what police believe would have happened. Emails sent from an internet café near Naseer' s home had been intercepted in the weeks before Naseer , who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013 arrest. The final message led police to believe an attack was imminent. Known as the\" Hi Buddy\" email because of the way The final message greeted an al - Qaeda operative, The final message reads:\" I met with Nadia family and we both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from Nadia family and Nadia family said you should be ready between these dates.\" The jury was told female names, including Nadia, represented different ingredients used to make bombs. Wedding, or ' nikah ', was a standard al - Qaeda code for a terror attack. Based on the Islamic calendar, investigators believed this email was referring to a planned attack during the Easter weekend in 2009. Other evidence included photos of Naseer' s friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre. Naseer ' s claimed photos of Naseer ' s friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre were innocent pictures as Naseer ' s friends travelled around Manchester. But retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue described the images as\" hostile reconnaissance\". retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue said:\" photos of Naseer ' s friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre for retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue was the most alarming thing. To see each entrance of the Arndale Centre being photographed … photographed was clearly a means by which they would brief the would - be attackers as to what the would - be attackers would see as the would - be attackers made the would - be attackers approaches.\" Police think the first target would have been the Arndale Centre, which had been rebuilt following the IRA bomb attack on Manchester in 1996. The terrorists would have walked in carrying bombs made out of fizzy drink bottles in rucksacks or specially modified T - shirts. After the first wave of explosions, there would have been a second attack with more suicide bombers waiting in St Anne' s Square for the rush of shoppers trying to escape. The target was chosen by al - Qaeda leaders because of the financial impact as well as the huge number of potential victims. According to Dr David Lowe, a retired special branch officer who now teaches law at John Moores University in Liverpool, it would have been a devastating attack. Dr David Lowe , a retired special branch officer who now teaches law at John Moores University in Liverpool said:\" it would have potentially been bigger than the 7 / 7 attack in London. it would have sent shockwaves around the world. And it would have shown that not just capital cities are targets.\" The scale of the potential disaster is something the man who led the police investigation is well aware of. Det Supt Smith said the relief Det Supt Smith felt at the time of the arrests continued today.\" Every day since that time Det Supt Smith' ve thought about this case and wondered exactly what would have happened if we didn' t detain Naseer ' s.\" Det Supt Smith' ve always been convinced that we prevented an atrocity in Manchester.\"",

The inquiry is expected to be split into three parts: establishing what happened, examining the procedures adopted by police to prevent wrongdoing, and recommendations for the future. Preliminary hearings are due to start in the autumn and the inquiry is set to last three years. The inquiry' s terms of reference include:. The allegations were first widely reported in 2011 when a former undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, offered to help defend, in court, six environmental campaigners whom a former undercover officer , Mark Kennedy had infiltrated. That trial collapsed - and later the same year, there were further revelations of undercover relationships, one of which led to a child. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent. The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary. That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into undercover police officers activities. The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control. Seven key issues the inquiry will examine. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan - Howe said undercover policing was an important tactic, but had to be done legally. He told BBC London:\" We, for the police, will make the case that our undercover officers are incredibly brave and our undercover officers deal with some very dangerous people.\" our think this is a vital part of our toolset and if our don' t have this then our don' t suffer, but the public might.",

        "document": "Mr Kasyanov, a former prime minister, is a high - profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the opposition RPR - Parnas party. Recently Mr Kadyrov called Mr Putin' s critics\" enemies\" and\" traitors\". Russian opposition politicians have described the posting as a murder threat. The Chechen leader said Mr Kasyanov was seeking cash in Strasbourg for the opposition.\" Whoever doesn' t get cash will get cash!\" Ramzan Kadyrov : Putin ' s key Chechen ally . warned. Last March Mr Kadyrov spoke out on Instagram about the assassination of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. That message defended one of the Chechens charged over the shooting. A day later President Putin gave Mr Kadyrov a top award. Mr Nemtsov was among several well - known opponents of Mr Putin murdered in the past decade. Putin loyalist Kadyrov unleashed on Russian ' traitors ' Ramzan Kadyrov: Putin' s key Chechen ally. Mr Kadyrov runs Chechnya with an iron fist - Ramzan Kadyrov : Putin ' s key Chechen ally . private militia has been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and assassination. Ramzan Kadyrov : Putin ' s key Chechen ally . has close ties to Mr Putin, who encouraged Ramzan Kadyrov : Putin ' s key Chechen ally . to stamp out a separatist insurgency in Chechnya. Thousands of civilians died in the North Caucasus republic when Russian troops fought the rebels there in the 1990s. The new video is the latest in a series of threatening messages from Mr Kadyrov against Kremlin critics, whom Ramzan Kadyrov : Putin ' s key Chechen ally . accuses of working for the West. the video shows Mr Kasyanov talking to Vladimir Kara - Murza, a journalist who runs the pro - democracy opposition movement Open Russia. The movement was launched by exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The video was posted late on Sunday and has more than 16, 000\" likes\". Mr Kasyanov says Mr Kasyanov , a former prime minister sees the video as a direct death threat and will demand a criminal investigation. Ilya Yashin, who co - chairs RPR - Parnas with Mr Kasyanov, called the video\" an open threat to murder Kasyanov\". Another opposition leader, anti - corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, echoed that view. On Facebook, Mr Navalny said ( in Russian)\" there is no longer any doubt that all such statements in recent weeks and specifically this one were approved by Putin and the Kremlin, and quite probably were inspired by Putin and the Kremlin too\". The BBC' s Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says they key question now is whether Mr Kadyrov is acting on Ramzan Kadyrov : Putin ' s key Chechen ally . own initiative. One theory discussed on Russian social media is that Ramzan Kadyrov : Putin ' s key Chechen ally . is being used by the Kremlin to intimidate the Kremlin critics - particularly as growing economic problems raise the potential for protest. Others suggest that Mr Kadyrov is becoming a dangerous loose cannon - a regional leader who believes Ramzan Kadyrov : Putin ' s key Chechen ally . is untouchable, our correspondent reports. The phrase\" Whoever doesn' t get it will get it!\" is the title of a thriller that Mr Kadyrov says Kadyrov the Instagram fan has filmed, starring Kadyrov the Instagram fan as a machine gun - toting all - action hero.

Since the news broke ' North Korea ' has been mentioned 211, 000 times on Twitter and has been among the top trending topics worldwide. So what can be done to prevent North Korea' s move escalate to an international crisis? Here are some of your ideas. @ martinedobor tweets there should be greater agreement on weapons:. It' s saddening and worrying that North Korea says that North Korea ' s carried out an H - bomb test. That claim must be taken seriously by any person who cares about peace. the claim is a wake up call for the UN to swing into action in full force and stop North Korea' s obsession with nuclear bombs. The UN should not wait until small ripples turn into huge waves before thinking of how to get to the shore. Josephat Ombuna, Nairobi, Kenya. @ Jackalchachal thinks North Korea should be invited to talks:. North Korea needs to be accountable for North Korea ' s actions like any country. It' s time for the world to have some serious dialogue with North Korea ' s. If you want to have nuclear weapons then you need to be trusted and must abide the rules. This would be the first big step to resolve this issue. Let' s invite Kim Jong - un to the United Nations in New York and get down to business. Chris, Northfield, Vermont USA. @ SouljaTroy1996 has a simple solution:. In @ SouljaTroy1996 opinion sanctions are the way to go, if at all possible. Unfortunately sanctions may cause more hardship on the people of the North. War is out of the question - we are fighting enough wars in the Middle East. @ SouljaTroy1996 have thought deeply about this question for a while now ( still am), with China being an ally this would also be a concern for NATO. Kim Jong - un is a loose cannon and unpredictable and is makes Kim Jong - un a threat. Robert Anderson, Dundee, Scotland UK. I think we need to be prepared for any possible threat of North Korea ' s using weapons such as these. However, I don' t think we should charge in and force North Korea to stop producing nuclear weapons. That is of course assuming North Korea ' s have been successful in making nuclear weapons. If we or any other countries for that matter become aggressive to North Korea ' s, the retaliation could be much worse. It' s best to prepare for the worst but mainly ignore North Korea ' s. It' s not like many of the countries condemning North Korea' s actions have any moral high ground when many of the countries condemning North Korea ' s actions many of the countries condemning North Korea ' s actions are sat upon a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. It' s like a child in a playground showing off a child in a playground strength, if a child in a playground are not challenged a child in a playground won' t have the opportunity to show a child in a playground force in a fight.

But Ms Sturgeon told STV News that any referendum would not been held in 2017. Nicola Sturgeon predecessor, Alex Salmond, has predicted a vote on independence will be held in the autumn of next year. Ms Sturgeon said:\" There is not going to be an independence referendum in 2017, Nicola Sturgeon don' t think there is anybody who thinks going is the case.\" Nicola Sturgeon has previously said a vote on independence will be held if the Scottish government concludes a vote on independence is the only way to protect Scotland' s place in Europe. Ms Sturgeon has urged the UK government to negotiate a so - called soft Brexit and retain the UK government membership of the single market. Failing that, Nicola Sturgeon wants a special arrangement to allow Scotland to stay in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves. The first minister' s latest comments regarding the timing of a second referendum follow Nicola Sturgeon insistence at the weekend that Nicola Sturgeon is not bluffing on calling a re - run of the 2014 ballot if Scotland' s position is ignored. But Nicola Sturgeon has also indicated that a soft Brexit could take the issue off the table in the short - term. Ms Sturgeon told BBC One' s Andrew Marr Show:\" ourselves in Scotland have to ask ourselves in Scotland are ourselves in Scotland happy to have the direction of our country, the kind of country Scotland ' s want to be, determined by a right - wing Conservative government perhaps for the next 20 years, or do ourselves in Scotland want to take control of our own future?\"\" That' s the case that in those circumstances, Nicola Sturgeon think, it would be right for Scotland to have the opportunity to decide.\" Asked if Nicola Sturgeon was looking at a referendum\" much quicker\" than in five or 10 years ' time if there was a hard Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon said:\" Nicola Sturgeon would think, yes. But let Nicola Sturgeon not get away from this point, Nicola Sturgeon' m putting to Theresa May a compromise solution.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said ruling out an independence referendum this year was an\" empty gesture\" by Ms Sturgeon. Accusing the first minister of\" leaving Scotland in limbo\", Ms Davidson added:\" If Nicola Sturgeon' s serious about allowing Scotland to move on from constitutional navel - gazing, Nicola Sturgeon should ditch Nicola Sturgeon draft referendum bill immediately.\" Scottish Labour deputy leader Alex Rowley said:\" While it is welcome that Nicola Sturgeon has ruled out another independence referendum in 2017, ruled doesn' t come close to ending the uncertainty. \" The first minister should rule out forcing another independence referendum on the people of Scotland altogether, not just for the next twelve months.\" But the Scottish Greens welcomed the Scottish government ' commitment to keeping a second referendum on the table. Co - convenor Patrick Harvie said:\" This cannot be a quiet time ahead for supporters of independence; although the Brexit negotiations will take two years, work must begin now to build support and strengthen our case.\"",

Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan resisted efforts by police to get Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan off the train at Bicske, about 40km ( 25 miles) west of Budapest.

Many of the migrants currently in Hungary have been refusing to register there, in order to continue Many of the migrants currently in Hungary journeys to Germany before seeking asylum. Nothing illustrates how difficult this crisis is to resolve than what has happened to these several hundred refugees who are currently on this train at Bicske. Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan jumped on the train after waiting at Budapest station for three hours. Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan were really tightly crammed in - women and babies. Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan were told no international trains would leave. but eventually Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan were told this train would leave and Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan believed and hoped this train would take Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan close enough to the Austrian border to get across. There were some police on board. We got as far as Bickse and when the train pulled in, there were loads of police waiting for Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan on the platform. The plan seemed to be to remove Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan, to take Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan to a centre where Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan would be properly identified. Some people left the first carriage, but almost immediately there was resistance, a lot of people were banging on the windows, some were shouting\" Germany! Germany!\" The police put on riot gear. And then there was one really distressing scene involving a woman who was carrying a baby by the railway tracks shouting\" help! help!\" There was a struggle involving one of her companions and riot police. This incensed some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train, some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train began pushing and jostling and there was a little bit of fighting with the riot police. And then some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train forced some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train way back on the train, which is where we are at the moment with police on the platform with several hundred refugees on the train in sweltering conditions. International services from Budapest' s Keleti station were suspended indefinitely. There have been days of tension at the station. The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels this year. Germany expects to take in 800, 000 asylum seekers this year - four times last year' s total. The surge in numbers has created tension and disagreement over EU migration policy. Germany has been prepared to accept large numbers of asylum seekers, but other countries have not. Mr Orban, who heads the anti - immigration Fidesz party and was in Brussels for talks, said Hungarians and other Europeans were\" full of fear\" because\" Hungarians and other Europeans see that the European leaders, among the European leaders the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation\".

EU states instead so far committed to sharing some 32, 000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece. Mr Tusk also took Mr Orban to task for comments in which the Hungarian leader said Mr Orban , who heads the anti - immigration Fidesz party and was in Brussels for talks country was being\" overrun\" with refugees who threatened to undermine Europe' s Christian roots. European Council president Donald Tusk said:\" Referring to Christianity in a public debate on migration must mean in the first place the readiness to show solidarity and sacrifice.\" The human cost of the crisis was also put into sharp focus on Wednesday when five children were among 12 migrants who drowned in Turkish waters while trying to reach Greece.

        "document": "Mr Pistorius says Oscar Pistorius ' s mistakenly shot Oscar Pistorius ' s girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through the door, believing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was a burglar, then broke the door down with the bat. The prosecution says Oscar Pistorius ' s tried to beat down the door and then fired the gun. Mr Pistorius denies intentionally killing Ms Steenkamp in February 2013. Forensic expert Police Colonel Johan Vermeulen also said Colonel Johan Vermeulen , a decorated forensic expert in the South African Police Service ( SAPS ) thought Mr Pistorius had hit the door with the bat from a low angle, indicating Oscar Pistorius ' s was not wearing Oscar Pistorius ' s prosthetic legs at the time. By Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Pretoria. A big day in the Oscar Pistorius murder case. The defence worked tirelessly to disprove a finding by Colonel Johan Vermeulen, a decorated forensic expert in the South African Police Service ( SAPS). Oscar Pistorius' s toilet door stood obtrusively in the courtroom, held up by a white frame, behind Oscar Pistorius ' s toilet door a toilet cubicle. Col Vermeulen, a state witness, told the court that based on the marks on the door and the marks on the door level Mr Pistorius was on Oscar Pistorius ' s stumps when Oscar Pistorius ' s struck the door with a cricket bat. The defence strongly challenged Colonel Johan Vermeulen , a decorated forensic expert in the South African Police Service ( SAPS ) version, adding that Mr Pistorius ' defence team will present Mr Pistorius ' defence team own expert witness who will prove Mr Pistorius was in fact wearing Oscar Pistorius ' s prosthetics. Defence lawyer Barry Roux also introduced another dimension to the case, suggesting that the police recklessly handled the crime scene - Defence lawyer Barry Roux pointed to police shoe prints on the door. The forensics from the scene are a make or break for either side. Mr Roux' s plan seems to include discrediting the integrity of the evidence collection process. Defence lawyer Barry Roux has already hinted at the possible contamination of the crime scene, placing the SAPS under a rather embarrassing spotlight. This contradicts the athlete' s claim that Oscar Pistorius ' s had been wearing Oscar Pistorius ' s artificial limbs. Correspondents say whether or not the athlete was on Oscar Pistorius ' s prosthetic limbs is important because it could match parts of Oscar Pistorius ' s story that Oscar Pistorius ' s accidentally shot Ms Steenkamp, or expose inconsistencies in his story that he accidentally shot Ms Steenkamp. The damaged toilet door, with four bullet holes, was examined in the courtroom along with a replica of the toilet cubicle. Forensic evidence on the location from which shots were fired, how shots were grouped and shots trajectory were presented to the court on Wednesday. Cross - examining, Mr Pistorius ' defence team asked forensic expert Col Vermeulen to kneel and lift Colonel Johan Vermeulen , a decorated forensic expert in the South African Police Service ( SAPS ) feet, which caused Colonel Johan Vermeulen , a decorated forensic expert in the South African Police Service ( SAPS ) to wobble. The defence team claimed that Mr Pistorius therefore would not have been able to balance on Oscar Pistorius ' s stumps and break down the door using a cricket bat. Defence lawyer Barry Roux also alleged that police had contaminated the crime scene by stepping on the door. Col Vermeulen argued that if Mr Pistorius was balanced enough to fire a gun, Oscar Pistorius ' s could also break down a door with a bat. The forensics expert argued that the angle and location of the marks on the door suggested that the marks on the door had been caused by someone much shorter than Mr Pistorius '. The defence team argued that a mark on the bottom of the door showed where Mr Pistorius had tried to kick open the door using Mr Pistorius ' prosthetic legs. Col Vermeulen agreed that tried was possible.\" The marks on the door are actually consistent with Mr Pistorius ' not having Mr Pistorius ' legs on and Col Vermeulen suspect the marks on the door must be similar to the height that Mr Pistorius ' was when Mr Pistorius ' fired the shots,\" Col Vermeulen told the court. The prosecution argues that Mr Pistorius hit the door with the cricket bat before the shots were fired, but the defence claims it was the other way round. The trial is now halfway through The trial second week. Earlier on Wednesday, a friend of Mr Pistorius claimed that the star had driven at 200 km / h ( 124mph) and that a friend of Mr Pistorius had taken a picture of the speedometer to prove driven. The defence team alleged that Darren Fresco was a friend of Mr Pistorius driving at the time and had therefore fabricated evidence. On Tuesday, Mr Pistorius ' defence team questioned a pathologist' s finding that Mr Pistorius ' girlfriend had eaten less than two hours before Mr Pistorius ' killed Ms Steenkamp , a 29 - year - old model , and reality TV star. a pathologist ' s finding that his girlfriend had eaten less than two hours before he killed her contradicts the athlete' s account that the pair had been in bed for several hours before the shooting. The state is seeking to convince the court that Mr Pistorius and Ms Steenkamp, a 29 - year - old model, and reality TV star, had an argument before the athlete fired the shots that killed Ms Steenkamp , a 29 - year - old model , and reality TV star. There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and Mr Pistorius ' fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors. If found guilty, the 27 - year - old, a national sporting hero dubbed the\" blade runner\", could face life imprisonment.",

Around 2006, into 2007 there was an uptick. There was a high water mark in 2009 [ at the time of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen].\" From that high water mark to 2014, coverage has dropped: 36 % globally; 26 % in the US; and as much as 55 % in the UK.\" Within the last year here in the United States, National Public Radio reduced National Public Radio environment reporting team from three to one reporter.\" We see examples of reduced unfolding quite regularly. There' s certainly newsroom pressures. There' s shrinking time to deadline, there' s reduced resources to cover complex issues such as climate change that require a certain level of investigation, a certain level of familiarity with the contours and the nuances of the topics.\" Jennifer Morgan is the Global Director of the climate change programme at the World Resources Institute.\" Copenhagen was supposed to be the moment when over 190 countries came together and agreed a new legally binding agreement to address climate change. It was very much a great excitement and anticipation of trying to finally get a global agreement after the Kyoto years.\" Jennifer Morgan remember walking in with a colleague of Jennifer Morgan, and saying ' Okay, we have to do it. we have to get it done, these moments don' t happen very often '.\" But it soon became clear that negotiations weren' t going to plan:.\" In the middle of the second week normally what happens is the options start to get narrowed down, and you can see the package emerging. That wasn' t happening, and that' s when we all started to get very concerned.\" China' s chief negotiator was barred by security for the first few days, sessions were routinely suspended in the name of finishing on time, developing countries said developing countries were ignored, and the EU was missing from a final meeting where a last - minute, non - binding deal was drawn up.\" It was terrible. [ We felt] an exhausted defeat, just a deep fatigue, particularly from the European side, of just wanting to take a break. The personal sacrifice - it sounds crazy - but believing and trying to make something happen, I think it was a trauma, just to put so much blood, sweat and tears into it.\" Right after Copenhagen, there was a sense that there needed to be a bit of a time out on the world leaders ' side of things. So it definitely went into a very low level of attention for a few years. The relationships of some of the Heads of State after Copenhagen were quite strained.\" Even months after, it was almost like [ some of the Heads of State] had been being psychologically burned by this.\" That' s had a real impact on the willingness of these individuals to stay engaged.\" Environmental psychologist Robert Gifford researches why even those who accept a link between human behaviour and climate change are reluctant to act.\" Our brain physically hasn' t developed much for about 30, 000 years. At that time ourselves were mostly wandering around on the Savannah, and our main concerns were very immediate: feeding ourselves right now, worrying about anybody who might try to take our territory. There was very little thinking about what might happen in five years, 10 years, or 100km away.\" We still have this same brain. Obviously We' re capable of planning, but the kind of default is to stick into the here and now, which is not very good for thinking about climate change, which is a problem that, for many people, is more in the future and farther away, or at least we think climate change , which is a problem that , for many people , is more in the future and farther away , or at least we think it is is.\" [ And] as any advertiser knows, if you don' t change your message people will just tune out. And so environmental numbness is ' yes, I' ve heard that message before '. We' re always open to new messages, and paying more attention to new messages.

'\" Most of us who are trying to do something about this global problem have realised, for example, that the polar bear metaphor is not a great one. Yes, we have some sympathy for this poor polar bear, but it' s not close enough to our own lives.\" Uncertainty is a really big problem. We' ve learned in my own laboratory from experimental evidence that when people feel a bit uncertain about an environmental problem - if the future temperature might vary from a half a degree increase to a one and a half degrees increase - people will say ' well, it' s probably only going to be a half a degree increase, so people' ll keep flying to some tropical place '.\" It' s a natural human tendency to interpret information in a way that suits our personal interests. Joe Smith teaches geography at the Open University and argues the narrative around climate science must evolve.\" Joe Smith' m not sure that people need to engage with climate change at all. climate change' s more or less unreportable if you just describe climate change on the page. climate change' s complex, interdisciplinary, the findings drip out over time, and the boundary between science and policy and politics is a very messy one. climate change' s a real challenge for the media.\" The idea that we will mobilise any more people with fear messaging is wrong. Joe Smith think we' ve knocked at the door of everyone that might respond to such a thing, but you' ve also got to ask whether it' s an accurate way of telling the science. Joe Smith think it is more respectful to the nature of the science to say that the science' s one of humanity' s most ambitious questions.\" There was a tactical wrong turning in suggesting that by insisting that the debate is over, we can move onto the action. It somehow implied that the science was complete, and implied, of course, left lots of space for those people who have arguments about the actions on climate change to stand in the way of us having a proper public conversation about those actions because those people who have arguments about the actions on climate change were able to pick apart minor details in the science.\" It' s not just that climate science isn' t finished, the science' s actually unfinishable. \" The rest of science - particle physics, cosmology - is allowed to be rather saucy. I would love to get to the point where we allow climate change science to simply be interesting, enchanting even, as fascinating as any area of science because climate change science' s a hugely ambitious and compelling mission.\" If you want to talk to a business person, you talk about energy security for a business person business or energy security for a business person nation.

But there' s a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re - enactments.\" Mr Alexander think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander.\" You ask 10 people in a room if 10 people in a room' ve ever heard of mead, and two of 10 people in a room might say, ' yes ', and only one of 10 people in a room has had a very positive experience.\" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn' t appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed.\" People don' t realise that just because [ mead ] has honey in [ mead ], [ mead] doesn' t need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers. Yet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead the word. Technically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US. classified means that mead has to be labelled as\" honey wine\", which doesn' t help combat people' s perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet.\" How do people recognise it as mead if you can' t say the word?\" says Ms Rowe. Ironically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer. The craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand many home brewers repertoire.\" Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit , Michigan was a home brewer, and at first Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit , Michigan liked mead because Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit , Michigan had never had mead,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan.\" Every home brewer has the same dream of, ' Hey what if Every home brewer could sell this? Wouldn' t sell be great? '\" Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit , Michigan says. After Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit , Michigan spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit , Michigan recipe, Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit , Michigan realised that mead was\" kind of an untouched category\", and that no - one, at least back in 2008, was really doing mead commercially. So when Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit , Michigan and Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit , Michigan wife, Kerri, were both laid off of he and his wife , Kerri jobs in Detroit' s car industry during the recession, he and his wife , Kerri decided to take the plunge. Now, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1, 100 cases a week across the country. But for Mr Dahlhofer and Mr Dahlhofer fellow mead enthusiasts, that' s just the beginning.\" If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, craft beer had 1 % of the total beer market, and now craft beer have 8 %,\" says Maine Mead' s Mr Alexander.\" So we' ve got a long way to go, but Maine Mead ' s Mr Alexander feel like it' s got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage.\" You' ve got a canvas with very few limits.\"",

        "document": "Assistant nurse Emilie Telander, 26, cheers as one of the day patients at Svartedalen' s elderly care home in Gothenburg manages to roll a six in a game of Ludo. But Ms Telander ' s smile fades as Ms Telander ' s describes Ms Telander ' s own luck running out at the end of the year, when after 23 months of six - hour shifts, Ms Telander ' s was told to go back to eight - hour days.\" Ms Telander ' s feel that Ms Telander ' s am more tired than Ms Telander ' s was before,\" Ms Telander ' s reflects, lamenting the fact that Ms Telander ' s now has less time at home to cook or read with Ms Telander ' s four - year - old daughter.\" During the trial all the staff had more energy. Ms Telander ' s could see that everybody was happy.\" Ms Telander is one of about 70 assistant nurses who had about 70 assistant nurses who had their days shortened for the experiment , the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Sweden involving a range of employers , from start - ups to nursing homes days shortened for the experiment, the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Sweden involving a range of employers, from start - ups to nursing homes. Designed to measure well - being in a sector that' s struggling to recruit enough staff to care for the country' s ageing population, extra nurses were brought in to cover the lost hours. The project' s independent researchers were also paid to study employees at a similar care home who continued to work regular days. The project ' s independent researchers final report is due out next month, but data released so far strongly backs Ms Telander' s arguments. During the first 18 months of the trial the nurses working shorter hours logged less sick leave, reported better perceived health and boosted the nurses working shorter hours productivity by organising 85 % more activities for the nurses working shorter hours patients, from nature walks to sing - a - longs. However, the project also faced tough criticism from those concerned that the costs outweighed the benefits. Centre - right opponents filed a motion calling on Gothenburg City Council to wrap the experiment , the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Sweden involving a range of employers , from start - ups to nursing homes up prematurely last May, arguing it was unfair to continue investing taxpayers ' money in a pilot that was not economically sustainable. Saved from the axe at the eleventh hour, the trial managed to stay within budget, but still cost the city about 12 million kronor ( Â £ 1. 1m; $ 1. 3m).\" Could we do this for the entire municipality? The answer is no, this will be too expensive,\" says Daniel Bernmar, the Left Party councillor responsible for running Gothenburg' s elderly care. But Daniel Bernmar , the Left Party councillor responsible for running Gothenburg ' s elderly care argues the experiment still proved\" successful from many points of view\" by creating extra jobs for 17 nurses in the city, reducing sick pay costs and fuelling global debates about work culture.\" the experiment , the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Sweden involving a range of employers , from start - ups to nursing homes' s put the shortening of the work day on the agenda both for Sweden and for Europe, which is fascinating,\" Daniel Bernmar , the Left Party councillor responsible for running Gothenburg ' s elderly care says. \" In the past 10, 15 years there' s been a lot of pressure on people working longer hours and this is sort of the contrary of been.\" Yet while work - life balance is already championed across the political spectrum in Sweden, the chances of the Nordic country trimming back Sweden ' s standard 40 - hour week remain slim. On a national level, the Left Party is the only parliamentary party in favour of shortening basic working hours, backed by just 6 % of voters in Sweden' s last general election. Nevertheless, a cluster of other Swedish municipalities are following in Gothenburg' s footsteps, with locally funded trials targeting other groups of employees with high levels of illness and burnout, including social workers and hospital nurses. Cleaners at Skelleftea Hospital will begin an 18 - month project next month. There' s also been an increase in pilots in the private sector, with advertising, consulting, telecoms and technology firms among those testing the concept. Yet while some have also reported that staff appear calmer or are less likely to phone in sick, others have swiftly abandoned the idea.\" Erik Gatenholm , chief executive of Gothenburg - based bio - ink company really don' t think that the six - hour day fits with an entrepreneurial world, or the start - up world,\" argues Erik Gatenholm, chief executive of Gothenburg - based bio - ink company. Erik Gatenholm , chief executive of Gothenburg - based bio - ink company is candid enough to admit Erik Gatenholm , chief executive of Gothenburg - based bio - ink company tested the method on Erik Gatenholm , chief executive of Gothenburg - based bio - ink company production staff after\" reading about the trend on Facebook\" and musing on whether the six - hour work day could be an innovative draw for future talent. But the firm' s experiment was ditched in less than a month, after bad feedback from employees.\" Gabriel Peres thought the six - hour work day would be really fun, but the six - hour work day felt kind of stressful,\" says Gabriel Peres, as Gabriel Peres slots a Petri dish inside one of the 3D printers Gabriel Peres' s built for the company.\" the six - hour work day' s a process and the six - hour work day takes time and when you don' t have all that [ much] time the six - hour work day kind of feels like skipping homework at school, things are always building up.\" On the other side of the country, Gabriel Peres concerns are shared by Dr Aram Seddigh, who recently completed Dr Aram Seddigh , who recently completed his doctorate at Stockholm University ' s Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation ' s shifting work patterns doctorate at Stockholm University' s Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation' s shifting work patterns.\" Dr Aram Seddigh , who recently completed his doctorate at Stockholm University ' s Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation ' s shifting work patterns think the six - hour work day would be most effective in organisations - such as hospitals - where you work for six hours and then you just leave [ the workplace] and go home.\" the six - hour work day might be less effective for organisations where the borders between work and private life are not so clear,\" Dr Aram Seddigh , who recently completed his doctorate at Stockholm University ' s Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation ' s shifting work patterns suggests. \" This kind of solution might even increase stress levels given that employees might try to fit all the work that employees have been doing in eight hours into six - or if employees' re office workers employees might take the work home.\" Back in Gothenburg, Bengt Lorentzon, the lead researcher for the Svartedalen care home project, argues that the concept of six - hour days also jars with the strong culture of flexible working promoted by many Swedish businesses.\" A lot of offices are already working almost like consultancies. There' s no need for managers to have all managers workers in the office at the same time, managers just want to get the results and people have to deliver,\" Bengt Lorentzon , the lead researcher for the Svartedalen care home project says.\" Compare that to the assistant nurses - the assistant nurses can' t just leave work to go to the dentist or to the doctors or the hairdressers.\"\" So Bengt Lorentzon , the lead researcher for the Svartedalen care home project don' t think people should start with the question of whether or not to have reduced hours.\" First, it should be: what can we do to make the working environment better? And maybe different things can be better for different groups.\" It could be to do with working hours and working times, but It could be a lot of other things as well.\" Listen to Maddy Savage' s report on Sweden' s experiment with six - hour days on The World Tonight.",

Alonso ' s drove a controlled race and stayed just far enough ahead of Alonso ' s pursuers to maintain the lead. Great strategy calls from the team to keep Alonso ' s ahead through the pit stops. Alonso ' s knew it would be a long race to the end. Button climbed up from sixth on the grid to pass Vettel at the second pit stops but was re - passed with two laps to go. However, the Englishman was promoted to second place after race stewards gave Vettel a 20 - second penalty for Vettel overtake of Button on the penultimate lap. Lewis Hamilton retired with gearbox damage after running well down the field following an early puncture. But Lewis Hamilton will not incur any penalty for a gearbox change because of Lewis Hamilton retirement. The result extends Alonso' s championship lead to 34 points ahead of Red Bull' s Mark Webber who had a low - key race to eighth place, never showing any real pace. Alonso said:\" a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag was tough, not an easy race. Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and were was enough to maintain the lead.\" Great strategy calls from the team to keep Alonso ' s ahead through the pit stops. Alonso ' s knew it would be a long race to the end, with Jenson putting pressure.\" But the car was feeling good on top speed and traction and were was enough to keep the lead into Turn 6, and after Turn 6 overtaking is not so easy.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. The only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of Lewis Hamilton 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade. At one stage, Hamilton unlapped Lewis Hamilton on Vettel - although not Alonso - as Lewis Hamilton attempted vainly to recover from Lewis Hamilton early set - back. A move which angered the double world champion. Alonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure first Vettel and then Button could not use first Vettel and then Button DRS overtaking aids to pass Alonso ' s into the hairpin at Turn 6. It led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag. The Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before first Vettel and then Button first pit stops to ensure Alonso ' s held the lead into the second stint. Meanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place. Vettel emerged from the Red Bull first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making the Red Bull second stop a lap earlier. Vettel emerged from the pits to find Button on the Red Bull outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position. Button was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps the Ferrari driver stretched away as Button began to lose grip in Jenson rear tyres. Rather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed Jenson at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap. Vettel said:\" The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when the Red Bull was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking.\" the Red Bull am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but was was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and the Red Bull am happy with Second place.\" Button said:\" the race was a close race and Jenson couldn' t quite get Fernando at the end.\" When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and Jenson was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you' re in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don' t need to push.\" It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. Jenson ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back.\" But the race was a fun race and it' s nice to be on the podium again. Jenson' ve had Jenson feeling back the last two races but the pace hasn' t been there [ in the car], but today the pace was. We' re there or thereabouts at the front, still a little way to go.\" Raikkonen provided some exciting racing as Raikkonen moved up from 10th on the grid. On the way, Raikkonen engaged in top - class racing with Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher and the Force Indias of Nico Hulkenberg and Paul di Resta.

On the first anniversary of Storm Desmond, experts say November to January were the wettest three months since UK records began in 1910. Review author Terry Marsh said flooding was\" extensive and repetitive\". Storm Desmond began battering parts of the UK on 5 December, depositing a record month' s worth of rain on Cumbria in just one day. About 5, 200 homes were flooded in Cumbria and Lancashire, while tens of thousands more lost power after an electricity sub - station in Lancaster was flooded. The storm caused an estimated insurance bill of more than Â £ 1. 3bn. Major storms\" Abigail\",\" Frank\" and\" Gertrude\" also hit the UK last winter.

        "document": "Mr Farage , whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years also suggested they should not be eligible for tax credits. It comes as a survey suggests 77 % of Britons want to see immigration cut. The coalition brought in a three month ban on EU citizens getting out - of - work benefits ahead of work restrictions being lifted for Bulgarians and Romanians on 1 January. But Mr Farage, whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years, said the government should go much further. Mr Farage , whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years said the cost of migrants claiming in - work welfare payments, such as child benefit, housing benefit and tax credits, had not been factored in to the government' s calculations.\" our must be completely mad, as a country, to be giving people from Eastern Europe in - work benefits,\" Mr Farage , whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years told BBC News. And Mr Farage , whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years said lower economic growth was a price worth paying for cutting immigration.\" Even if Mr Farage , whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years thought, which Mr Farage , whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years don' t, there was an economic benefit to mass immigration some things are more important than money, namely the shape of our society and giving our own youngsters a chance to work.\" London Mayor Boris Johnson also weighed in to the debate, suggesting the ban on EU citizens claiming benefits should be two years. Labour said Labour supported the government' s three - month ban, which Labour said was\" reasonable and achievable\". Downing Street said withholding benefits from migrants for longer periods may be illegal.\" the government ' s are doing all that the government ' s can within the law,\" said a No 10 spokesman. Downing Street also confirmed ministers were examining measures to curb the ability of migrants to claim child benefit for children in migrants native countries. The British Social Attitudes Survey suggests more than three - quarters of Britons want to see a cut in immigration - and 56 % want to see a major crackdown. Almost half of those surveyed, 47 %, thought immigration was bad for the economy, and among the 31 % of respondents who said immigration was good for the economy, half wanted to see immigration reduced anyway. The figures are revealed in a BBC Two documentary called The Truth About Immigration, to be broadcast later on Tuesday. Business Secretary Vince Cable tells the programme the government' s target of cutting net migration to below 100, 000 by 2015 is\" not helpful\" and will almost certainly not be achieved. Mr Cable, who has sought to distance Business Secretary Vince Cable from the net migration target in the past, calling the net migration target a Conservative and not a coalition policy, said politicians on all sides must be\" practical\" and accept that net migration cannot be controlled.\" net migration involves British people emigrating - you can' t control emigrating. It involves free movement within the European Union - in and out. It involves British people coming back from overseas who are not immigrants but are counted in the numbers,\" Mr Cable says.\" Setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful. Setting almost certainly won' t achieve the below - 100, 000 level the Conservatives are setting - so let' s be practical about it.\" Labour said the\" gap between the government' s rhetoric and reality on immigration is continuing to undermine public confidence\". Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said Mr Cable should toughen up enforcement of the minimum wage and prevent employment agencies recruiting solely from abroad. David Cameron promised to cut net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those emigrating - from more than 250, 000 a year to less than 100, 000 by the next election in 2015. After some initial success, the latest figures show net migration is on the rise again, going up from 167, 000 to 182, 000 a year, largely because fewer Britons were emigrating to eurozone countries. Asked last month if going meant it would be impossible to meet Mr Cameron target, Mr Cameron said:\" ' Mr Cameron don' t accept going.\"\" If you take the whole three - year period [ since the election], net immigration is down by around third.\" Mr Cameron said some measures the government had taken, such as closing\" bogus\" colleges and tightening up the rules on family reunion, would take time to have an impact. In Nick Robinson' s documentary, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says the Labour government of which former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was a prominent member\" got it wrong\" on immigration,\" and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw deeply regret got\". Labour MP and former Home Secretary David Blunkett adds:\" Labour didn' t spell out in words of one syllable what was happening, partly because of a fear of racism.\" Nigel Farage tells the programme:\" Labour tried to rubbish us, Labour tried to say that anybody that dared to talk about this subject was necessarily a bad person and racist, that was what Labour tried to do and actually that has been going on ever since [ Enoch] Powell' s speech.\" In the so - called\" rivers of blood\" speech, made in 1968, Mr Powell said Britain' s immigration policy was like watching a nation\" heaping up a nation own funeral pyre\". [ Enoch ] Powell ' s was sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet by party leader Edward Heath, who said [ Enoch ] Powell ' s speech was\" inflammatory and liable to damage race relations\". Asked whether Mr Farage thought Mr Powell had been right, Mr Farage says:\" Mr Powell was right for the wrong reasons. Mr Powell was wrong in the sense that Mr Powell felt that black and white would find it difficult to mix, but unfortunately Mr Powell' s been proved to be right because the sheer numbers that have come into Britain have led to segregation.\" BBC political editor Nick Robinson says all political parties now\" promise to control\" immigration because all political parties are\" acutely aware of the high level of public concern\" about immigration. In the programme, BBC political editor Nick Robinson looks back to a civil service paper published in 2001 which examined the economic and the social impact of immigration. The paper concluded that there was\" little evidence that native workers are harmed by migration\". a civil service paper published in 2001 which examined the economic and the social impact of immigration author, former Cabinet Office economist Jonathan Portes, said:\" Its author , former Cabinet Office economist Jonathan Portes think politicians do have to say to individuals who are negatively affected, and let' s face it there will be some: ' Yes, politicians' re doing this for the good of our country, and yes individuals who are negatively affected , and let ' s face it there will be some may lose out, but ultimately politicians still have to do this.

Dale Merza, 20, is charged with misdemeanour hazing after the alleged attack last October on Andrew Seely, 19, at Central Michigan University. Mr Seely, who was sleeping at the time of the incident, sought medical treatment for serous facial swelling. The accused could get 93 days in jail and a $ 1, 000 ( Â £ 800) fine if convicted. Mr Merza' s legal representative told the Detroit Free Press lawyer Bruce Leach client, who was charged on Friday in Isabella County District Court, was innocent.\" This case has been blown way out of proportion by the individual' s family members, who were not present and don' t have any of the facts,\" lawyer Bruce Leach told the newspaper. The practice is an induction ritual meted out typically to new members of the US college men and women' s social clubs known as fraternities and sororities, but also to military recruits. The practice can include physical violence, sexual coercion, forced alcohol consumption, or degrading and dangerous\" pranks\" such as forcing people to eat vile food mixtures or consume large amounts of water. The practice is illegal in most US states, amounting usually to a misdemeanour charge, unless there are serious injuries. There has been a nationwide crackdown on hazing after high - profile deaths including that of Florida A & M University drumming student Robert Champion. Why is hazing so common? Mr Seely was targeted at an off - campus fraternity house, Alpha Chi Rho, which was sanctioned in 2011 for hazing incidents. Mr Seely , who was sleeping at the time of the incident mother, Teresa Seely, wrote about the alleged hazing in a viral Facebook post in March, saying:\" Mr Seely , who was sleeping at the time of the incident could have been killed.\" The accounting student only told Mr Seely , who was sleeping at the time of the incident family what had happened months afterwards. Mr Seely , who was sleeping at the time of the incident blamed the incident for Mr Seely , who was sleeping at the time of the incident decision to leave the college. The teenager' s father, Paul Seely, told CBS News The teenager ' s father , Paul Seely son could have been killed if the peanut butter had entered Mr Seely , who was sleeping at the time of the incident mouth. The Seely family said The Seely family son had made known to other members of the fraternity that Mr Seely , who was sleeping at the time of the incident had a severe peanut allergy, for which Mr Seely , who was sleeping at the time of the incident carries medication. The National Fraternity of Alphi Chi Rho condemned the incident, saying The National Fraternity of Alphi Chi Rho did not condone such behaviour.\" Alpha Chi Rho is appalled and upset by the actions taken by individuals against Andrew Seely,\" said an off - campus fraternity house , Alpha Chi Rho , which was sanctioned in 2011 for hazing incidents statement.",

Mr Paksas , an aerobatic pilot in Soviet times is now a Euro MP in Strasbourg.

But the judges did not award Mr Paksas compensation, saying The Strasbourg judges ruling was in The judgement by the Strasbourg court on Thursday\" sufficient just satisfaction\". Lithuania was found to have violated Article Three of Protocol One ( Right to free elections) in the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2004 Mr Paksas became the first European head of state in modern times to be impeached and removed from office. The former Soviet republic' s constitutional court found that Mr Paksas , an aerobatic pilot in Soviet times had illegally arranged Lithuanian citizenship for a Russian - born businessman, Yuri Borisov. But Mr Paksas, an aerobatic pilot in Soviet times, was cleared of the charge of having leaked state secrets to Russia. After the constitutional court had backed Mr Paksas' s disqualification, the Lithuanian parliament adopted a new electoral rule barring anyone from becoming an MP if anyone had previously been dismissed in impeachment proceedings. Mr Paksas complained that the rule had been passed deliberately to bar Mr Paksas , an aerobatic pilot in Soviet times from office. Mr Paksas , an aerobatic pilot in Soviet times also said the constitutional court had lacked impartiality and had exceeded the Baltic state ' s constitutional court powers.

Officials said the schools were closed out of an\" abundance of caution\" and there were no specific safety threats. School administrators say a different lesson will be used in the future. One week ago, students at Riverheads High School were studying the Middle East and were asked to trace a piece of Arabic calligraphy that translated to:\" There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah\". Some pupils refused the assignment and parents accused the teacher of indoctrination. Officials with the Augusta County school district were quick to point out that the study of a region' s religion and language are included in geography lessons. However, anger built up and by Wednesday complaints had become so numerous that the school' s doors were locked and monitored. By Friday, the messages - described as profane and hateful - had increased and the decision was made to close the schools. Officials said that no specific threats were received, but law enforcement officials and the school district board recommended the closure because law enforcement officials and the school district board were being cautious. The lesson was intended to illustrate the complexity of the Arabic language, law enforcement officials and the school district board said, and not meant to promote any religious system. But future classes will use a different, non - religious example of Arabic.

        "document": "For this has been the worst year on this, or indeed any other, commissioner' s watch. As the league closes in on an annual revenue of £ 16bn ( $ 25bn), expansion plans into Europe and specifically London, continue apace. And as Goodell tops up Goodell himself bank balance with a yearly income in the region of £ 26m ( $ 40m), the professional game of American Football is more popular and yet, some would argue, more contemptible than ever. Fifty NFL players were arrested in 2014 for a wide degree of offences - from Tennessee' s Shonn Greene, who parked in a disabled parking bay, to Minnesota' s Adrian Peterson, who was arrested over child abuse. There were five cases of domestic violence, including that of Baltimore' s Ray Rice, who was filmed by hotel security punching Baltimore ' s Ray Rice , who was filmed by hotel security punching his then fiancee - now wife - in a lift then fiancee - now wife - in a lift. Goodell Goodell himself became personally embroiled in the Rice case in an argument over what the NFL did or did not know. There was also a far - reaching report chaired by the former director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, which highlighted the fundamental mismanagement of the situation by league officials. And the bad news kept on coming for the embattled commissioner. Just 30 days into 2015, there have been four fresh player arrests, including two for domestic violence and one for rape. Elsewhere, it is a sorry tale:. Yet despite all this mayhem and chaos the NFL, as a product, is flourishing. The moral outrage surrounding the cases of Rice and Peterson calmed down fairly quickly and audiences flocked yet again to stadiums around the country. More than 17m attended the 256 regular season games, the highest figure since 2008, while television audiences hit record highs. Media playback is not supported on this device. While youth participation figures are down over concerns surrounding long - term brain damage caused by concussion, NFL fans are embracing the game like never before, both within the United States and globally. The annual Harris Report, which tracks the popularity of American sports, says the NFL is still number one by a huge margin - double the popularity of Major League Baseball and College Football. A report released this week by the sports market research group Repucom also makes some interesting claims, notably that:. Most of the television networks that broadcast the NFL had audiences tuning in in greater numbers than in 2013, while the figures for both Thursday and Monday Night Football were up significantly. More than 47m people watched the NFL' s annual College Draft, yet not one pass was thrown or one tackle made. There were also 9. 6m tweets about the event across the NFL ' s annual College Draft three days. Nielsen, who gather audience ratings in the US, reported extremely strong numbers for the very first 9. 30am EST kick - off between Detroit and Atlanta in London, so much so that the NFL will repeat the experiment next season. Although some fans showed some fans disdain for Rice, Peterson and others arrested last year by returning Rice , Peterson and others arrested last year replica shirts, many still turned up wearing Rice' s number 27 jersey and Peterson' s number 28 long after Rice , Peterson and others arrested last year cases made the national press. Despite everything, the NFL remains America' s game. So why the appeal in the face of growing off - field problems? Simply put, the NFL is full of great stories, exceptional games and, most importantly, great players. The college version of the game is flourishing as well. Elsewhere in America, the other two major professional leagues - the National Basketball Association ( NBA) and Major League Baseball ( MLB) - have suffered with falling television ratings and general popularity over the past few years. Baseball' s lack of true star power means Major League Baseball ( MLB ) has fallen out of the national conversation, arguably since 1998 and the infamous home - run record chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who have subsequently become embroiled in steroid controversies. The names of baseball' s 2014 All Stars, such as Chase Utley, Nelson Cruz and Paul Goldschmidt, do not possess the same pulling power as football stars such as JJ Watt, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers or Calvin Johnson. Baseball simply is not cool anymore and the appeal for the game has become as much regional as the appeal for the game is national. Jonathan Mahler wrote in the New York Times recently that:\" Baseball has never been healthier\" - in terms of attendance, revenue, and, unlike the NFL and NBA, freedom from labour strife.\" So why does Major League Baseball ( MLB ) feel so irrelevant?\" With each team playing 162 games a season, baseball fans tend to watch baseball fans own players in action rather than those baseball fans have no vested interest in. That is not the case for the NFL. Almost 19m watched the Dallas Cowboys take on the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football. The NBA has also suffered in the post - Michael Jordan years, with falling attendances and viewing figures. However basketball has been rescued somewhat by the LeBron James effect, while the game, with the game ongoing connection with hip hop culture, continues to grow with a younger audience. Along with the phenomenon that is College Basketball' s March Madness, College Basketball ' s remains a popular sport in America, but continues to be dwarfed by the NFL. The NBA is, according to the Harris Report, America' s sixth most popular sport but is struggling with the increase in popularity of soccer and a resurgence in appreciation for ice hockey. It would also be foolish to think that the NFL is the only organisation with off - field problems. Baseball continues to move from one steroid scandal to another, while the NBA has witnessed the NBA own fair share of domestic violence, domestic assault, battery and driving under the influence cases. The NFL is a runaway success train that shows no sign of halting. And while the on - field product remains so good, the off - field issues will be nothing more than a distraction. Green Bay Packers fan Zoe Lake is representative of millions:\" Football has always been a part of Green Bay Packers fan Zoe Lake life. As a football fan and a woman, Green Bay Packers fan Zoe Lake believe the NFL needs to take a good, hard look at the way the NFL has handled the epidemic of violence that has rocked the league and the nation.\" But recent events will not keep Green Bay Packers fan Zoe Lake from tuning in to catch Green Bay Packers fan Zoe Lake Packers. Let' s not forget: It is only a small number of NFL players who have committed violent acts against women and children.\" In April' s Draft, commissioner Goodell will welcome University of Oklahoma wide receiver Dorial Green Beckham into the professional ranks, potentially in the first round. Multiple drug arrests and a dismissal from the University of Missouri for allegedly forcing open an apartment door and pushing an 18 - year - old woman down a flight of stairs will not stop University of Oklahoma wide receiver Dorial Green Beckham being given every opportunity to succeed on the field. Even if University of Oklahoma wide receiver Dorial Green Beckham transgresses again, transgresses will be just another problem for America' s most popular sport. But a problem the NFL will overcome, have no doubt.",

The team had always insisted Force India had Perez under contract for 2017 but it took some time to finalise commercial arrangements with the driver and the group of Mexican companies that sponsor both Perez ' s and the team. Perez' s career was hanging by a thread when Perez ' s was dropped by McLaren after one season with McLaren in 2013 but since joining Force India Perez ' s has scored four podium finishes to add to the three Perez ' s achieved with Sauber in 2012. In the process, Perez ' s has emerged in the last couple of seasons as one of the better - regarded drivers behind the big names in the leading teams and has more than justified Perez ' s place at the pinnacle of the sport, despite the fact Perez ' s brings money to a team to secure Perez ' s place. Both Williams and, particularly, Renault were interested in Perez ' s, but Perez ' s has decided that Force India is Perez ' s best competitive opportunity. The team have one of the smaller budgets in F1 but have impressed in recent years for Force India ability to produce a competitive car. If Force India can maintain fourth position this season under pressure from Williams, fourth position would be Force India best finish since the team were in Force India original guise as Jordan, who peaked with third place in 1999. Perez' s decision leaves only a few loose ends to be tied up in the 2017 F1 driver market. Williams are expected to announce shortly that Williams are promoting Canadian novice Lance Stroll, who on Sunday won the European Formula 3 championship, to partner Williams current driver Valtteri Bottas. Brazilian Felipe Massa announced last month that Brazilian Felipe Massa was retiring at the end of the season, which would leave Renault as the only major team not to have firmed up their drivers.

        "document": "What did the court say? Until now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work. On Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time those without a fixed or habitual office spend travelling between those without a fixed or habitual office homes and the premises of those without a fixed or habitual office first and last jobs as part of those without a fixed or habitual office hours for the day. The ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive. I' m a care worker who travels to different patients ' homes. Am I affected? Possibly, yes. Employees who fall into the category loosely defined as\" mobile workers\" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected. Simon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category. As many as 975, 000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC. And some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds. I travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office. The ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says. There may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office. I have to commute two hours every day to I office. For those with a permanent office ( however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the\" overwhelming majority\" in the UK. I think I' m affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in I hours? The ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage ( once travelling time is taken into account). the European judges ' ruling could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up. the European judges ' ruling could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48 - hour maximum.\" Mr Tutton think some employers will look at where some employers' re sending staff - some employers might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because some employers don' t want to eat into that working time that some employers have,\" Mr Tutton said.

But an RPA statement on Monday read:\" The Premiership season is already longer than comparable contact sports, including Super League, NFL and AFL.\" Extending an already arduous season from nine months to 10 has serious implications for players, given the potential increase to the game, training and psychological loads players face.\" The physical and mental strain placed on participants of professional contact sport cannot be underestimated.\" England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland will all be playing international matches in June this summer, while the British and Irish Lions are also touring New Zealand. The RPA has concerns that an extended season could overwork any players involved in future international summer tours - a worry shared by Tigers captain Youngs.\" Perhaps most worryingly is the incredible strain these proposals would place on international players,\" the statement continued.\" If the Premiership season retains the Premiership season current start date, the addition of a July tour schedule will lead to an 11 - month season for these players.\" lead cannot be avoided unless these players start these players domestic season later, which brings into question the need for the season extension.\"",

Nato insists Nato ' s took unprecedented care to minimise civilian casualties. Nato ' s argues that Nato ' s cannot take responsibility because Nato ' s has had no presence on the ground to confirm the deaths. Aircraft from the US, the UK and France conducted most of the 9, 658 strike sorties last year, targeting forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. In March, another human rights organisation,. Amnesty International, said it had documented 55 cases. of named civilians, including 16 children and 14 women, killed in air strikes. it described Nato' s failure to investigate these cases thoroughly as\" deeply disappointing\". The point of the Nato air campaign in Libya last year was to protect civilians, so how many innocent people died is still a sensitive issue, BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall reports. In Human Rights Watch report published on Monday, HRW said Human Rights Watch had examined in detail evidence of claims of civilian deaths from eight separate Nato strikes. In one instance, Human Rights Watch said a first Nato bomb killed 14 people and a second bomb, moments later, killed 18 more who had rushed to help victims. What concerns Mr Abrahams, the main author of the report, is that the deaths remain unacknowledged and the families have been offered no compensation.\" Until now, Nato has taken a position of denial,\" HRW ' s Fred Abrahams said. Source: Nato.\" Nato ' s refuse to give information about how civilian deaths from eight separate Nato strikes died and Nato ' s refuse to investigate, and it is this lack of transparency that is deeply troubling.\" HRW ' s Fred Abrahams think it will lead to unnecessary civilian deaths in the future if Nato refuses to look at what went wrong and make corrections.\" Nato says Nato ' s is ready to co - operate with the new Libyan authorities in assessing what further action is appropriate.

Samantha will be testing new machine technology and how well new machine technology work in space, such as this astronaut joystick. Using a joystick in space may feel very different in space compared to on Earth. So these experiments will see how being in space might affect how well an astronaut can control a space robot or space machinery. Another thing is that equipment may need to be attached to the astronaut so equipment doesn' t float away. The testing will also see what impact attached has. Samantha will be doing lots of experiments to see how being in space affects The European Space Agency astronaut body. For example, The European Space Agency astronaut will experience 16 sunrises and sunsets every day on the International Space Station and be tested to see how experience affects The European Space Agency astronaut body clock. Another important subject is food and energy. Experiments to see how much food an astronaut would need for a long mission will be carried out. Samantha will record what The European Space Agency astronaut eats and The European Space Agency astronaut energy levels over a period of time.

        "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device. It began when McKinstry left behind a glamorous Manhattan lifestyle for the wonder and wastelands of Sierra Leone five years ago. It will end when McKinstry walks through the front door of the family home in Lisburn, Belfast for Christmas, having lived through an incredible time in modern history. Very few 29 - year - olds have managed a national football team. None have done managed while that country is being brought to that country knees by Ebola.\" McKinstry' m very sad, very emotional,\" McKinstry said.\" Saying goodbye to Sierra Leone was very emotional, very difficult. McKinstry don' t keep McKinstry distance from things; McKinstry invest emotionally. The country has become part of McKinstry.\" Having been an academy coach with the New York Red Bulls, McKinstry was appointed technical director of the Craig Bellamy academy in Sierra Leone at the age of 24. By 27, McKinstry was manager of the national team. Within 18 months McKinstry squad were in the top 50 of the world rankings for the first time.\" McKinstry' ve made a career of proving doubters wrong,\" McKinstry said. Two months ago McKinstry was sacked by email, as the Ebola outbreak gathered momentum.\" We believed We had the chemistry, cohesion and spirit to achieve anything. But the Ebola outbreak changed everything. Circumstances meant that, in the end, it was an impossible job.\" McKinstry stepped off a plane four hours before we met in a London hotel. McKinstry had not slept for the best part of two days. The journey to Freetown Airport had to be made by boat to avoid some of the areas worst affected by Ebola. An early flight meant crossing the night before. A night at an airport, one plane to Morocco, another to London followed by a medical check by customs officers is no ordinary preparation for an interview. But for a man who has spent much of the past six months living in lockdown, being among the bustle again is a welcome change. McKinstry time in Sierra Leone has now come to an end. The memory of His time in Sierra Leone will, however, live on.\" In the last month or so when McKinstry went into Freetown for supplies, McKinstry started to see more of the Ebola response teams, with the full yellow bio - hazard suits,\" McKinstry said.\" You might see an ambulance driving past and even the driver would be in the full bio - hazard gear.\" When you see that it really does bring it home to you just how serious the situation is.\" McKinstry was offered a way out, a safe passage home in July, but refused a way out , a safe passage home. Many of the players in the academy were from affected areas, McKinstry felt McKinstry had a duty of care not to walk away and send the young footballers into danger. Instead McKinstry quarantined the academy behind the gate and walls of the compound.\" When the outbreak started a lot of people ran for cover,\" McKinstry said.\" But Ebola is a disease of contact, if you remove the contact, you remove the risk. So remove is what we did. we moved everyone who was off site, behind the walls. we had generators for power, bore holes for fresh water, we had dorm rooms, classrooms and a football pitch.\" In Northern Ireland McKinstry family were growing increasingly worried about the situation. Did his family want McKinstry home?\" his family wanted information. his family wanted to know what was going on, to know that McKinstry was safe, that the boys at the academy were safe,\" McKinstry said. It is not sensationalist to suggest that the Ebola virus cost McKinstry McKinstry job as head coach. But before McKinstry explained how it came to an end, McKinstry addressed the question of how it began.\" When it comes to football, confidence has not been something McKinstry have been lacking,\" McKinstry said with a smile.\" There is a saying in Newcastle - ' shy bearns get nowt ' - if you don' t ask you don' t get.\" That was McKinstry attitude to the Sierra Leone job. McKinstry know McKinstry was 27 but if Sierra Leone ' s said no, nothing is lost. If Sierra Leone ' s said yes, it was going to be the start of an exciting new chapter.\" McKinstry had watched every Sierra Leone home game in person, every away game on TV, McKinstry had watched Sierra Leone ' s train, studied Sierra Leone ' s players.\" McKinstry thought McKinstry was the best man for the job,\" McKinstry added.\" McKinstry got in the room with the decision - makers and McKinstry went through Sierra Leone' s last two games with a fine tooth comb and Tunisia' s last two, who would be our next opponents.\" McKinstry outlined how McKinstry' d beat Tunisia, how McKinstry saw the future. Every member of the panel went away with a dossier, which McKinstry told the panel the panel could keep and use even if the panel didn' t choose McKinstry.\" Two days later the panel offered McKinstry the job.\" McKinstry made an impressive start, losing just one of McKinstry first six matches and leading Sierra Leone into the top 50 of Fifa' s world rankings, above Northern Ireland, the Republic, Cameroon and Senegal. Then the Ebola outbreak happened and football became a side issue. \" We looked at what little We could do as sporting heroes, could We put smiles on the faces of the nation?\" McKinstry said.\" Football is a second religion in Sierra Leone.\" So when the national team wins, the national psyche is buoyed, everyone walks an inch or two taller. We made a commitment to keep on winning to try to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations so that people in the country would feel a little bit better. Unfortunately it wasn' t to work out that way.\" The Confederation of African Football ruled that Sierra Leone could not play games at home. A challenging task was becoming a near - impossible one.\" In football, the home team tends to win 50 % of the time. In Africa, the home team wins 65 or 70 % of the time,\" McKinstry explained. That was not the only complication.\" In McKinstry final game, against DR Congo, We had 17, 000 fans just chanting ' Ebola, Ebola, Ebola ' at We. chanting was upsetting for our players. The atmosphere was difficult. It made the players angry that people were mocking the situation in the players homeland,\" McKinstry said. Sierra Leone players found opponents unwilling to shake hands, hotels unwilling to check Sierra Leone players in and governments uncertain on granting Sierra Leone players entry.\" People fear things People don' t know,\" McKinstry said.\" Hotel arrangements were monitored wherever We went, there were daily medical checks for McKinstry players and, while daily medical checks for my players is not overly difficult, daily medical checks for my players can impact on players ' mental state.\" Sierra Leone' s first group game as Sierra Leone ' s attempted to qualify for the African Cup of Nations was away to Ivory Coast in early September. With a week to go, McKinstry was still unsure whether McKinstry and McKinstry players would be allowed into the country. The confusion meant some players had to buy some players own plane tickets. Others arrived the night before the game. Sierra Leone led for an hour, only to lose 2 - 1. The demands of the squad schedule meant the squad left at 11pm that night to fly to DR Congo for a ' home ' qualifier that was to be played in the away team' s stadium. That game too ended in a 2 - 0 defeat and was marred by chants of ' Ebola, Ebola. ' McKinstry did not see the end coming. McKinstry said:\" McKinstry had been in the FA building that day and not once was anything mentioned. McKinstry was driving back home, over a mountain pass, when McKinstry phone buzzed with an email from one of the men McKinstry' d been speaking to, not two hours earlier. It said the FA had terminated The boyhood Newcastle United fan contract. The boyhood Newcastle United fan was disappointed. The boyhood Newcastle United fan' d been standing in the FA office a few hours earlier.\" But The boyhood Newcastle United fan believe in a certain way of doing things. So The boyhood Newcastle United fan spun the car around, went straight back to the FA, not to argue with the FA but just to go in shake hands and say ' best of luck for the future and it has been a pleasure for the past 18 months. '\" McKinstry has a voracious appetite for football and for learning, The boyhood Newcastle United fan lives and breathes football and The boyhood Newcastle United fan sense of adventure means predicting The boyhood Newcastle United fan next move is not easy. In the New Year The boyhood Newcastle United fan has a series of meetings in Asia. The boyhood Newcastle United fan is not a man who does things by the book. Having been a coach from the age of 15, McKinstry already has miles on the clock. The boyhood Newcastle United fan still dreams of taking charge at St James ' Park or leading The boyhood Newcastle United fan native Northern Ireland out.\" Nothing would make The boyhood Newcastle United fan prouder, The boyhood Newcastle United fan heart would be beating out of The boyhood Newcastle United fan chest for both those opportunities at some stage in The boyhood Newcastle United fan career.\" Watch the full interview with Johnny McKinstry - Football Focus, BBC One on Saturday 20 December at 12: 10 GMT.",

During that hearing, which formally charged the five men, the defendants made defiant outbursts and refused to answer the judge' s questions or use the translation system. In addition to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, defendants Ramzi Binalshibh, Mustafa Ahmad al - Hawsawi, Ali Abd al - Aziz Ali and Waleed bin Attash are being prosecuted in a special military tribunal for wartime offences known as a military commission. their clients are charged with conspiring with al - Qaeda, terrorism, and one count of murder for each known victim of the 11 September attacks at the time the charges were filed - 2, 976 in total. The five face a possible death penalty sentence if convicted. CIA waterboarding tapes revealed. On Monday, the defendants listened calmly and answered the judge' s questions, although Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said:\" Khalid Sheikh Mohammed don' t think there' s any justice in this court.\" Defence lawyers argued during the hearing that Defence lawyers clients should not be forced to attend the rest of the week' s hearings, because the forcible transport from their clients high - security cells may remind their clients of their clients time at secret CIA prisons. Before their clients transfer to the US base at Guantanamo Bay in 2006, the defendants were held for years in secret CIA prisons. All five have said their clients were tortured during interrogations. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was repeatedly water - boarded before being brought to Guantanamo.\" We have to talk about torture,\" Air Force Captain Michael Schwartz, a defence lawyer, said on Monday.

Mission scientists said Mission scientists believed Kepler - 452b was the most Earth - like planet yet. Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because Such worlds might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on Such worlds surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life. Nasa' s science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world\" Earth 2. 0\" and the\" closest so far\" to our home. Kepler - 452b is around 1, 400 light years away from Earth. Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa' s Ames Research Center in California, added:\" It' s a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There' s a new kid on the block that' s just moved in next door.\" The new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler - 186f that are similar in many ways to Earth. Determining which is most Earth - like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler - 186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own. Kepler - 452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun is just 4 % more massive and 10 % brighter. Kepler - 452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so Kepler - 452b orbital period is 5 % longer than Earth' s. The mass of Kepler - 452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If Kepler - 452b is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and Kepler - 452b gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet. The new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars. Twelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth' s diameter, orbiting in the so - called habitable zone around Twelve of the new candidates star. This zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet' s surface if certain other conditions are also met. Of these 500 candidates, Kepler - 452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet. Dr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News:\" Dr Suzanne Aigrain , from the University of Oxford , who was not involved with the study do believe the properties described for Kepler - 452b are the most Earth - like Dr Suzanne Aigrain , from the University of Oxford , who was not involved with the study' ve come across for a confirmed planet to date. \" What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre - existing Kepler planet catalogue.\" the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth - like planets, which is the top - level goal of the Kepler mission.\" While similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler - 452b' s host star is 1. 5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe Kepler - 452b ' s could point to a possible future for the Earth.\" If Kepler - 452b is indeed a rocky planet, Kepler - 452b ' s location vis - a - vis Kepler - 452b ' s star could mean that Kepler - 452b ' s is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of Kepler - 452b ' s climate history,\" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission.\" The increasing energy from Kepler - 452b ' s aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.\"\" Kepler - 452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.\" Dr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC:\" Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to the planet host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet.\" However, to go further - i. e. is Kepler - 452b ' s rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and these measurements ( which are incredibly difficult ) is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements ( which are incredibly difficult) to make.\" So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: Kepler - 452b ' s could be rock but Kepler - 452b ' s could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.\" Dr Chris Watson, from Queen' s University Belfast, UK, commented:\" Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth - like in this respect. For example, Kepler - 186f is approximately 1. 17 Earth radii, and Kepler - 438b is approximately 1. 12 Earth radii.\" In fact, at 1. 6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler - 452b in a category of planet called a ' Super - Earth ' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within our Solar System! Super - Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really ' Earth - like ' given all this?\" Paul added:\" When we look at the type of star Kepler - 452b orbits, then Kepler - 452b seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M - dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating.\" So Kepler - 452b may be a potentially rocky super - Earth in an Earth - like orbit ( in terms of host star and orbital distance). It' s this combination of the host star and orbit that set Kepler - 452b apart in Paul opinion.\" The findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal.

        "document": "Mr Trump said they did not discuss The New York businessman plan to make Mexico pay for the wall - a central plank of The New York businessman campaign. But Mr Pena Nieto later tweeted:\" Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto made it clear Mexico would not pay for the wall.\" After the meeting, Mr Trump flew to Phoenix, Arizona, to deliver a key speech on tackling illegal immigration. At they joint press conference in Mexico City, Mr Pena Nieto said Mexicans had been hurt by some of Mr Trump' s previous comments but Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto believed The New York businessman now genuinely wanted to build relations. The New York businessman called Mexicans\" amazing\" and\" spectacular\" people, in contrast to earlier comments branding Mexican migrants\" rapists\" and\" murderers\". Forcing Mexico to pay for a wall has become a rallying cry among The New York businessman supporters. The New York businessman Democratic rival Hillary Clinton said not bringing Forcing up was a sign of cowardice.\" It turns out Trump didn' t just choke, The New York businessman got beat in the room and lied about got beat,\" His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton tweeted. Mexicans tell Trump: ' The New York businessman' re not welcome! ' Donald Trump' s Hispanic voter ' doomsday ' ' Me gustan los tacos! ': A Spanish phrasebook for Trump' s visit. The Republican has seen The New York businessman poll ratings slip since the party conventions last month. Both nationally and in key states, The New York businessman trails Hillary Clinton, who enjoys particularly strong support among minorities. Donald Trump has called Mexico an enemy of the US, but on Wednesday The New York businessman said Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was The New York businessman friend. That contrast illustrates how different Diplomatic Donald was from the firebrand candidate who tore through the Republican primaries by flogging The New York businessman opponents for being soft on illegal immigration and border security. If the goal of Mr Trump' s visit to Mexico City was to represent The New York businessman nation on the world stage without the kind of embarrassment or controversy that Hillary Clinton warns would be certain if The New York businessman is elected, then The New York businessman last - minute trip was a success. But The New York businessman surprise appearance south of the border may come with a price. Mr Trump ' s visit to Mexico City is likely to make it more difficult for The New York businessman to back away from hard - line immigration positions that are unpopular among moderate voters. Perhaps more grating for Mr Trump' s diehard supporters is that The New York businessman had the chance to confront the Mexican leader and instead spoke of protecting\" hemispheric manufacturing\" and avoided the subject of who would pay for the border wall. Diplomatic Donald may not be the candidate Mr Trump ' s diehard supporters thought Mr Trump ' s diehard supporters were getting. Mr Trump said The New York businessman words to Mr Pena Nieto had been strong and straightforward. The New York businessman tried to put behind The New York businessman The New York businessman previous comments on Mexicans by saying those in the US had made a\" great contribution\". \" Mr Trump ' s have a great feeling for Mexicans. Mexicans are amazing people,\" Mr Trump ' s said. Mr Trump said Mr Trump ' s had employed many Mexicans and that many Mexicans were\" spectacular people with strong values of faith and community\". Mr Trump ' s went on to list five points Mr Trump ' s had set out in Mr Trump ' s talks:. Mr Trump said:\" We recognise and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of either country borders.\" But Mr Trump ' s said there was no discussion on who would pay for the wall. Mr Trump ' s had earlier threatened to stop cash earned by Mexicans based in the US being sent home until the country paid for the wall to be built. Mr Trump concluded by saying Mr Trump ' s was honoured by Mr Pena Nieto' s invitation to visit, adding:\" Mr Trump ' s call President Pena Nieto a friend.\" Mr Pena Nieto accepted there were border challenges but pointed out the massive contribution Mexicans have made to the US, and that\" six million jobs rely on exports to Mexico\". President Pena Nieto said:\" President Pena Nieto priority is to protect Mexicans wherever Mexicans may be. Mexicans in the US are honest people, hard - working people who respect Mexicans in the US families, Mexicans in the US community and the law. Mexicans in the US deserve everybody' s respect.\" Mr Pena Nieto has invited both US candidates to visit, but has faced criticism at home over Mr Trump. Ex - President Vicente Fox earlier told CNN:\" We don' t like Mr Trump ' s. We don' t want Mr Trump ' s. We reject Mr Trump ' s visit.\" Former First Lady Margarita Zavala tweeted:\" We Mexicans have dignity, and We Mexicans reject Mr Trump ' s hate speech.\" At least two demonstrations have been planned in Mexico City. Mexicans tell Donald Trump: ' Mr Trump ' s are not welcome ' What Trump has said about Mexico.\" They' re bringing drugs, They' re bringing crime, They' re rapists\" - May 2015. Mexico is\" ripping off the US more than almost any other nation\" - February 2015.\" Mexico continues to make billions on not only our bad trade deals but also relies heavily on the billions of dollars in remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the United States\" - from Mr Trump ' s immigration plan.... and what Mexico has said about Trump. President Pena Nieto spoke out against Mr Trump' s\" strident rhetoric\" in March, adding:\" Mr Trump ' s \" strident rhetoric \"' s how Mussolini got in, Mr Trump ' s \" strident rhetoric \"' s how Hitler got in, Mr Trump ' s \" strident rhetoric \" took advantage of a situation, a problem perhaps, which humanity was going through at the time, after an economic crisis.\" His predecessor, Felipe Calderon, insisted:\" Mexican people, Mexican people are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall.\" After Mr Trump vowed to reclaim all remittances derived from illegal wages, Mr Calderon' s predecessor Vicente Fox, told the BBC:\" Is Trump going to steal the money?

Or is it a case of what next? Even the most upbeat of Leicester fans would probably find it difficult to be positive about Claudio Ranieri ' s side Premier League title defence as the stats make for pretty grim reading - played 19, won five, drawn five and lost nine. To put that in some context, City lost just three times in the league last season. However, Claudio Ranieri' s side are through to the last 16 of the Champions League, where Claudio Ranieri ' s side will meet Sevilla for a place in the quarter finals. And after that, only the small matter of European giants such as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona would stand in the way of European glory... Season ticket holder Sam Webster remains quietly confident, but does not think the Foxes can go all the way in Europe.

        "document": "In a scrappy first half, Joe Garner drew a save from Aberdeen keeper Joe Lewis and crossed for Martyn Waghorn to volley over. Aberdeen dominated after the break as Wes Foderingham saved from Kenny McLean and twice from striker Adam Rooney. But Kenny Miller' s brace and Joe Dodoo' s third earned Rangers the win. Aberdeen are still well placed to finish runners - up to Premiership champions Celtic, with nine points and a far superior goal difference separating Derek McInnes ' s men from Rangers with only six games remaining. Derek McInnes' s men started the match as favourites and the early signs suggested Derek McInnes ' s men would live up to Derek McInnes ' s men billing as Derek McInnes ' s men pressed, fought and chased Rangers across every inch of the pitch. the match was more a bruising battle than a beautiful game, though, and referee Kevin Clancy was flashing cards early, with Garner and Ryan Jack the first to be booked as Garner and Ryan Jack squared up to each other. For all the match lack of free - flowing football, the match was a very watchable spectacle. Jonny Hayes forced a low save from Foderingham at one end and Waghorn should have burst the net rather than volleying over after a sumptuous cross from Garner on the right. The visitors actually enjoyed the best chances in the early stages despite Derek McInnes ' s men lack of fluidity in midfield. Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha said beforehand that Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha players were entering hell with this trip but it looked more like limbo as both sides continued to cancel each other out. The Portuguese was also well aware that anything other than victory would see Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha side consigned to third at best. The Ibrox side have obvious frailties at the moment, especially in defence where youngsters are deputising for more experienced injured regulars, but The Ibrox side showed fight and spirit that would be rewarded later in the match. Young David Bates looked slow and ponderous at times although Myles Beerman at left - back was composed and calm when needed. When Aberdeen click, click is mostly down to the hard work of Derek McInnes ' s men impressive wide men and so it was in the second half as Niall McGinn and Hayes terrorised the Rangers full - backs. Hayes skipped past two on Jonny Hayes way to the box but Graeme Shinnie' s hooked shot was blocked by Foderingham. McGinn was at it on the other side and Niall McGinn trickery was feeding Rooney but Niall McGinn fellow Irishman could not convert despite several gilt - edged invitations. You could sense the tide turning though and Rangers were struggling to contain the waves of red battering The Ibrox side defences. For all The Ibrox side efforts though, few chances were seriously testing Foderingham. With 11 minutes remaining, veteran striker Miller scored Kenny Miller ' s 10th goal in 40 appearances this season. Against the run of play, Waghorn created space for Martyn Waghorn in the box and when Martyn Waghorn shot was saved, 37 - year - old Miller lashed a fabulous effort high into the back of the net. Aberdeen had no time to compose Aberdeen before Miller made it two when Kenny Miller ( Rangers ) right footed shot from the centre of the box skipped through a defence in disarray to slide neatly past Lewis and send the small band of Rangers fans wild. Substitute Dodoo played Joseph Dodoo ( Rangers ) part in that second goal and Joseph Dodoo ( Rangers ) slammed home a third to complete an incredible five minute turnaround that sent the Dons fans scurrying for the exits in disbelief.

Mr Putin\" sees Mr Khodorkovsky ' s - sees' s obvious now - as a serious threat\", Mr Khodorkovsky ' s said. Once Russia' s richest man, the former head of the now defunct Yukos oil firm spent 10 years in a Siberian prison on fraud charges, which Mr Khodorkovsky ' s says were politically motivated. Mr Putin pardoned Mr Khodorkovsky ' s in 2013 and Mr Khodorkovsky ' s now lives abroad, mainly in Switzerland.\" Mr Khodorkovsky ' s' m considered by President Putin as a threat, economically, because of the possible seizure of Russian assets abroad, and politically, as someone who will potentially help democratic candidates in the coming 2016 elections,\" Mr Khodorkovsky ' s said. Russia will hold elections to the lower house of parliament - the State Duma - next year. The Duma is currently dominated by Mr Putin' s supporters. The BBC' s Richard Galpin asked Mr Khodorkovsky whether Mr Khodorkovsky ' s felt at risk in light of the murders of prominent opponents of Mr Putin in recent years. Among prominent opponents of Mr Putin was former secret agent Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned with radioactive polonium in a London hotel in 2006.\" The history of deaths of opponents of this regime is impressive... but Mr Khodorkovsky ' s was in jail for 10 years, Mr Khodorkovsky ' s could have been killed any day easily. In London Mr Khodorkovsky ' s feel much safer than during those years,\" Mr Khodorkovsky ' s replied. When Mr Khodorkovsky ' s left Russia in 2013 Mr Khodorkovsky ' s said Mr Khodorkovsky ' s would not get involved in politics - which was widely believed to have been the reason for Mr Khodorkovsky ' s early release. Mr Khodorkovsky ' s told the BBC on Wednesday that Mr Khodorkovsky ' s would\" help young political activists in Russia to gain political experience and present an alternative to the existing regime\". Mr Khodorkovsky ' s said it was\" far too optimistic\" to speak of regime change in Russia now,\" but Mr Khodorkovsky ' s' m quite confident that within 10 years the regime will be changed and Mr Khodorkovsky ' s hope Mr Khodorkovsky ' s will play a significant role in changed\". Earlier, referring to the Russian order for Mr Khodorkovsky ' s arrest, Mr Khodorkovsky ' s said the Moscow authorities had\" gone mad\". Mr Khodorkovsky ' s is accused of ordering several of Mr Khodorkovsky ' s employees to kill both the mayor and a businessman, who survived. Investigators allege Vladimir Petukhov, the mayor of Nefteyugansk, was killed on 26 June 1998 for demanding Mr Khodorkovsky' s oil firm, Yukos, pay taxes that the company had allegedly been avoiding. Local businessman Yevgeny Rybin was allegedly targeted because Mr Rybin activities\" clashed with Yukos' s interests\", Russia' s powerful Investigative Committee ( SK) said in a statement ( in Russian). Mr Rybin survived a gun attack in November 1998 and a second attack on Mr Rybin car in March 1999, when another man in the vehicle was killed and several people were injured. Five people have already been tried for the attacks and the arrest warrant is unlikely to make any difference unless Mr Khodorkovsky returns to Russia, the BBC' s Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. Armed police raided the Moscow offices of Mr Khodorkovsky' s Open Russia pro - democracy movement on Tuesday, in a move that authorities said was linked to allegations of tax evasion. The flats of at least seven activists who work for Mr Khodorkovsky were also searched. After Mr Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, Yukos was broken up and taken over by a state oil firm. Last year an international arbitration court in The Hague said Russian officials had manipulated the legal system to bankrupt Yukos, and jail Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The court told Russia to pay former shareholders in Yukos $ 50bn ( Â £ 32bn) in compensation. 1963 - Born in Moscow, son of chemical engineers. 1987 - Founds Menatep bank. 1995 - Buys Yukos for $ 350m, with Menatep assuming $ 2bn in debt. 2003 - Arrested for tax evasion, embezzlement and fraud. 2005 - Found guilty on six of seven charges, jailed for eight years. 2007 - Yukos declared bankrupt. 2010 - Convicted of embezzlement and money laundering. 2013 - Pardoned by President Putin after request for clemency; leaves Russia for Germany. 2015 - Charged with ordering 1990s murder of Siberian mayor; says Mr Khodorkovsky ' s is considering asking for political asylum in the UK.",

Mr Lavrov said the two sides had agreed to co - operate in areas where the two sides interests coincided, particularly in the fight against terrorism, over Syria and in other countries in the Middle East where\" terrorism has put down roots\". However, Mr Lavrov said that the two sides did not discuss US sanctions against Russia, first imposed when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine nearly three years ago. Mr Tillerson, who as ExxonMobil CEO was perceived to be close to the Russian leadership, told Mr Tillerson , who as ExxonMobil CEO was perceived to be close to the Russian leadership nomination hearing in the Senate that Mr Tillerson , who as ExxonMobil CEO was perceived to be close to the Russian leadership would consider reviewing the sanctions. Mr Tillerson also met the UK' s Boris Johnson and other foreign ministers from the G20, made up of developed economies and emerging nations including China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil.

The jihadists have also entered a nearby military base amid further clashes, a military spokesman said. Eastern Mosul was retaken last month. Thursday' s advance brings the army within less than a mile ( 1. 6km) of western Mosul, where the militants are expected to launch attacks from densely populated neighbourhoods. After darkness fell, government armour could be seen lining up for a new move forward, the BBC' s Quentin Sommerville reports from the scene. Thursday' s assault began with air strikes by the US - led coalition before armoured columns advanced to the airport' s perimeter. An Iraqi lieutenant was killed by one of the roadside bombs planted in the area by IS, the BBC has learned. Iraqi forces also came under fire from IS militants holed up inside airport buildings, reports said. Foreign troops from the US - led coalition were with the attacking troops, officials told the Associated Press news agency, without specifying Foreign troops from the US - led coalition nationality. The airport' s runway has been destroyed by IS but our correspondent, who is embedded with Iraqi federal police units, says The airport ' s runway still has value. the airport ' s is a large piece of land and controlling the airport ' s will help secure southern routes to west Mosul, our correspondent says. The airport and the al - Ghazlani base are on Mosul' s southern outskirts on the western side of the Tigris river. Thousands of Iraqi troops, backed by artillery and air power, are involved in the assault to retake Mosul. Leaflets warning residents of an imminent offensive were earlier dropped over western Mosul, where military officials say narrow winding streets could make retaking the area particularly difficult. Although slightly smaller than the east, western Mosul is more densely populated and includes districts seen as pro - IS. The UN has voiced concern about the welfare of civilians trapped in the city. Aram Shakaram, the country deputy director for Save the Children in Iraq, told the BBC Aram Shakaram , the country deputy director for Save the Children in Iraq believed relatively few people had been able to escape the city since Wednesday.

Separately, at least 200 people are missing after an IS attack on a factory near Damascus, the government says. Workers were reportedly taken from a dormitory where the workers were staying on the outskirts of the town of Dumeir, about 40km ( 25 miles) east of the capital. Activists from the UK - based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights say about 140 workers managed to escape.

The youngster had never even walked the Aintree course before Saturday' s race, but The 19 - year - old nephew of trainer Willie Mullins showed The 19 - year - old nephew of trainer Willie Mullins skill to make up three lengths on The Last Samuri after the final fence to take the lead at the Elbow and go on to win.

        "document": "Not far away, in Brooklyn Bridge Park, where once derelict piers have been converted into outdoor sports centres, the soccer pitches are usually more crowded than the basketball courts. A short walk down the hill, an archway under the Manhattan Bridge last summer hosted one of New York' s World Cup\" viewing parties\", where thousands gathered to watch games, and not just those involving the American national team. So it seemed incongruous to stand in front of the courthouse last week, fielding questions from presenters in London about why a country with no interest in football had suddenly assumed the role of global policeman of the global game. That line of inquiry seemed about a decade out of date. That line of inquiry is akin to the blanket condemnation that Americans lack a sense of humour or irony - this in the land of Jon Stewart, Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock, Amy Poehler, Jerry Seinfeld, David Letterman and Garry Shandling. True, football, or soccer as the game is known here, is not as central to American as the game is to European, African or South and Central American life. Nowhere near. Up until recently, the game has been unloved by the major US television networks, which have long bemoaned the lack of breaks in play, the paucity of goals and the glut of draws. Absent from the US game are big - name male stars and big - name clubs. The New York Red Bulls will never rival the New York Yankees. Real Salt Lake pales, rather risibly, alongside Real Madrid. However, football is no longer met with American indifference. Nor any more does football offer proof of America' s sporting isolationism. In this polyglot nation, the game is growing in popularity and importance, an upward trend that will continue long into the future as America becomes less white and more Hispanic. Already, America is the number one country in the world for youth participation in football. More than three million youngsters were registered to play in 2014, compared with just 103, 432 in 1974. Major League Soccer matches now have a higher average attendance - 19, 148 in 2014 - than basketball and ice hockey. The game ranks third after American football and baseball. Though the crowds here are significantly smaller than in the Bundesliga in Germany, the Premier League in England and Wales, La Liga in Spain or Serie A in Italy, the crowds here are on average bigger than in Argentina, Brazil, China or the Football League Championship. Bundesliga: 43, 532. Premier League: 36, 083. La Liga: 26, 803. Serie A: 22, 019. Major League Soccer ( in 2014): 19, 148. The Seattle Sounders, America' s most - watched team, attracts larger crowds for home games than Everton, Tottenham, Aston Villa or even Chelsea. The strength of the game in Seattle is also a measure of how US soccer popularity extends well beyond the new immigrant hubs of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Sporting Kansas City, in the American heartland, is also one of the better - supported sides. Last year' s World Cup in Brazil witnessed record viewing figures in America, even though the national team did not make it past the final 16. And even after the national team exited the tournament, viewers kept tuning in - 29. 2 million for the final between Germany and Argentina. By comparison, that year' s baseball world series attracted 13. 5 million. Nor is American enthusiasm for the World Cup a new phenomenon - more than 18 million people watched the 1994 final between Brazil and Italy - but American enthusiasm for the World Cup has been growing. The average viewing figure for matches in last year' s World Cup matches was 4. 3 million, up 50 % from 2010. All those kids who grew up playing the game are now, as adults, watching US soccer. More video:. Soccer seen as â € ˜ sissyballâ € ™ in Deep South. Why US soccer has no relegation. Do Native Americans play football? Football in America also transcends the gender divide. Of the kids playing the game, 48 % are girls. The USA has twice won Fifa' s Women' s World Cup, a record matched only by Germany. Mia Hamm, who accumulated a staggering 275 caps and scored 158 international goals, has been called America' s greatest female athlete of the past 40 years. In terms of Mia Hamm , who accumulated a staggering 275 caps and scored 158 international goals marketability, Nike ranked Mia Hamm , who accumulated a staggering 275 caps and scored 158 international goals alongside Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan. It is also worth remembering that one of the most sought after demographics in American politics is the country' s army of suburban\" soccer moms.\" The term is hardly new. The term was coined in the mid - 1990s. Money is another indicator of the game' s attractiveness. NBC splashed out $ 240m ( Â £ 160m) for the rights to Premier League football between 2013 - 16, three times more than Fox paid for the previous contract. With a fierce bidding war now under way, the next deal is expected to dwarf that figure. The wider availability of Premier League matches, which attract much bigger television audiences than domestic games, is also helping to raise the profile of the sport. Gone are the days when diehard fans used to have to find bars open on a Saturday morning with satellite feeds beamed in from Europe. Now every single Premier League game is available on cable. Ditto the FA Cup and Uefa Champions League. On Univision, the American Spanish language network with viewing figures on a par with the major US networks, soccer, unsurprisingly, is the number one sport. Broadcasting live matches has fuelled the channel' s rapid rise. No longer do foreigners have to explain the intricacies of the offside rule to perplexed locals, or why games are allowed to finish in a tie ( a draw). Many Americans are now fully literate in the sport. So while American soccer may never rival American football, the notion that the sport remains a niche sport is absurd. Though gridiron, baseball, basketball and ice hockey are known here as the\" Big Four\" sports, soccer has surely ousted ice hockey to join that quartet. the sport is the fourth most popular high school sport for boys, and the third for girls. There are many reasons why the US Department of Justice mounted these prosecutions. Two of those indicted, Jeffrey Webb and Chuck Blazer, were dominant figures in the American game. Jack Warner, of Trinidad and Tobago, used to head up Concacaf, the Miami - based Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football. Prosecutors claim the alleged bribery scheme relied heavily on the US banking system. But although the US authorities have also targeted foreign nationals, the US authorities do not regard soccer as a foreign sport. Announcing the charges, FBI director James Comey stressed how American kids and others at the grassroots had been deprived of resources. The FBI has cast a global dragnet, but this is also a homeland investigation. The Fifa allegations dominated the media here last week, and, paradoxically, dominated marks another milestone in the game' s recognition. The game has moved from the back pages to the front.",

        "document": "Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour was rattling across the arid wastes of the Baluch desert in Pakistan on Saturday morning in that most Afghan of cars - a battered white Toyota Corrola - when the missile, fired from a US drone, struck Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour vehicle. All that was left was a charred and twisted wreck beside the desert highway. US President Barack Obama described Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour death as an\" important milestone\", but disentangling what the killing of Mullah Mansour actually marks is not straightforward. The most obvious question is what the killing of Mullah Mansour will mean for the Taliban. The Pentagon said The Pentagon had targeted Mansour because Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour had become\" an obstacle to peace and reconciliation\". But it isn' t clear that the new leader will be any more open towards the peace process. Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhunzada was Mullah Mansour' s former deputy, and the official line from the Taliban is that Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhunzada approach is going to be very similar. What' s more, Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhunzada appointment doesn' t rule out the possibility of a battle for succession. Mansour struggled to contain the splintering of the movement into a series of factions that followed the death of Mullah Omar, the founder of the Taliban. That would increase instability in Afghanistan, fuelling local conflicts and entrenching the insurgency. Taliban leader Mullah Mansour killed, Afghans confirm. Afghan Taliban announce successor to Mullah Mansour. Mullah Mansour' s battle to be leader. Who are the Taliban? Profile: Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour. Then, there is the question of what the killing of Mullah Mansour means for US relations with Pakistan, which are regarded as crucial to the effort to fight global terrorism. The drone attack suggests the US has lost patience with the Pakistani authorities, which have failed to bring the Taliban to the table, while allegedly harbouring the movement' s leaders. So the killing of Mullah Mansour may actually set back the efforts to negotiate a peace settlement. On Monday, the US ambassador was summoned to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry to be harangued about what the Pakistani Foreign Ministry described as a\" violation of Pakistan' s sovereignty\". The official Pakistani line is that the attack will be an obstacle to future talks. The third question is the one most likely to affect those outside the region: the impact on the drugs trade. It would be tempting to conclude that removing Mansour will make the battle to eradicate opium more straightforward. Mansour helped oversee the transformation of the Taliban from a movement of pious fanatics, largely funded by true believers from abroad, into something very different. After the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, remittances from the Gulf fell away. The Taliban needed new sources of finance. Mullah Mansour is thought to have developed a huge new source of income for the Taliban - along the way enriching Mullah Mansour and Mullah Mansour fellow tribesmen. The movement Mullah Mansour officially took over last year had been refashioned into what is, in effect, a multi - billion dollar drugs cartel. Afghanistan has now completely eclipsed the former hub of world opium production, the so - called Golden Triangle between Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. But whether the death of Mansour will reduce Afghanistan' s opium production is a moot point. Helmand is a Taliban stronghold and traditionally accounts for around half of Afghan opium output. A senior official admitted to the BBC that the intense conflict in the province meant there had been virtually no eradication effort at all this season. Nevertheless, there is evidence that some farmers are moving away from poppy and back to less profitable food crops. One reason may be the effects of a mysterious blight that badly affected last year' s poppy harvest. Take a look at the changing patterns of cultivation in these desert areas of Helmand. These images are taken from a forthcoming AREU Watching Brief: Moving with the times: How opium poppy cultivation had adapted to the changing environment in Afghanistan. At the same time, there is considerable evidence that poppy production has increased in areas that are - nominally at least - controlled by the government. Last week, I visited an agricultural community just half an hour away from Mazar - e - Sharif in the north of Afghanistan. The city is, by Afghan standards, a model of good governance and has never been a stronghold of the Taliban, yet I found poppy being grown openly. Conversations with locals suggest that poppy production is not just tolerated, but is actively supported and protected by local police and government officials in return for kickbacks.\" Of course the authorities know we are growing poppies,\" a farmer called Taza Meer told I.\" the authorities can see we are growing poppies, but the authorities' ve got to keep quiet about it. The economy here is weak, people have no money.\" The authorities know poppy is the only way people here can make decent money, and the authorities know that people would be very angry if the authorities stopped people.\" a farmer called Taza Meer said if the government came in and destroyed a farmer called Taza Meer crop or that of other farmers, people would\" take to the mountains\".\" The people will take up arms,\" a farmer called Taza Meer told I.\" The people' ll have no choice but to rebel and there will be chaos here.\" Experts on opium cultivation say this is a pattern repeated across the country. Experts on opium cultivation say opium cultivation is a sign of the weakness of the government. It occurs when local authorities have no choice but to come to an accommodation with farmers. On that basis, there has been a steady deterioration of central authority, as this chart illustrates. It is striking that more opium was produced in 2014, the last year of the Nato combat mission, than in any other year since the UN started keeping records in 2002. Mansour may be dead - but, in the absence of other successful businesses, the opium trade has become an increasingly important enterprise in areas the government controls as well as Taliban - controlled areas. What become suggests is that, whoever is leader of the Taliban, Afghanistan is likely to continue to be the world centre of opium production. Indeed, this year, Afghanistan is expected to produce more opium - and therefore heroin - than the world consumes. It isn' t hard to work out what produce means: more and cheaper heroin coming to a street near you.",

The portrait, which has never been seen in public, has temporarily gone on show at the London gallery.

After Gambian Ayuba Suleiman Diallo was imprisoned for trying to escape, Gambian Ayuba Suleiman Diallo met lawyer Thomas Bluett who, impressed by Diallo' s intellect and education, took Gambian Ayuba Suleiman Diallo to England. Diallo was received with great enthusiasm by aristocrats and scholars. The National Portrait Gallery said Hoare' s painting was the first British portrait that honoured a named African subject as an individual and an equal.

        "document": "The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when the UK joined France in invading Suez - or when the UK has followed the US too blindly, as in the invasion of Iraq, against the warnings of many in Europe. Britain has done better when the UK has played the UK traditional role as a bridge between the two continents: seeking to manage America' s swings between isolationism and interventionism while at the same time reassuring Europe that the US could be more than just a brash Nato ally. This Atlanticist analysis is, of course, a simplification of a complex relationship, but the point stands: the UK has a unique opportunity by virtue of the UK history and geography to bring the US and Europe together, not take sides. And yet the election of Donald Trump risks doing just that, driving a wedge between Britain and the EU just when both sides need a wedge least. Since the president - elect' s shock election, the British government has staggered, recovered the government balance and started making overtures to the emerging administration. the government public statements have been welcoming and warm. Here is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson' s latest description of the president - elect, in a Czech newspaper:\" Donald Trump is dealmaker, next president of the United States is a guy who believes firmly in values that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson ' s believe in too - freedom and democracy. As far as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson ' s understand, next president of the United States is in many aspects a liberal guy from New York.\" This is a long way from the criticisms that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson ' s and Prime Minister Theresa May uttered during the campaign. But he and Prime Minister Theresa May are now eating he and Prime Minister Theresa May words without shame, for he and Prime Minister Theresa May believe that it is in the national interest for the government to engage with next president of the United States, whatever next president of the United States character, temperament and policy agenda. The prime minister' s Guildhall speech - arguing that everyone should benefit from globalisation - may have been designed to show British voters that Prime Minister Theresa May has an agenda for change. But it also sent a strong signal to Mr Trump that Prime Minister Theresa May understood the forces that led to next president of the United States election and the shared need for the whole world to address the forces that led to his election. In contrast, some EU countries have worn some EU countries hearts on some EU countries sleeve and expressed some EU countries dissatisfaction at the election of a man whose opinions some EU countries find distasteful. This was the context of the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers this week, which Boris Johnson dismissed as a\" whinge - o - rama\". Some British diplomats saw the meeting as an attempt by the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to grandstand and use Mr Trump' s election to drive forward the EU foreign policy chief , Federica Mogherini own agenda for more EU defence cooperation. Mrs May ' s was distinctly sarcastic about Mr Johnson' s refusal to attend the meeting, saying it was\" normal\" for a country that had decided to leave the EU not to be interested in a country that had decided to leave the EU relations with the US. As if that were not enough, Mr Johnson also clashed with Mr Johnson ' s EU counterparts over Turkey, urging his EU counterparts not to lecture Ankara over the death penalty. And some EU leaders will not like Mrs May acknowledging the strength of Mr Trump' s anti - globalisation arguments just as some EU leaders prepare to do electoral battle with populist parties flying the same anti - establishment flag. So on the face of it, Britain is falling out with Europe over Mr Trump just when the UK overwhelming foreign policy objective should be preparing the way for Brexit, working closely with European allies to find the areas of common ground where a potential deal could be done. This should be a time for cool diplomacy, not hot - headed spats over who is going to which meeting. And all this before the tough decisions come. Responding to an election is one thing. It is quite another to choose sides when there are real policy dilemmas on the table. What happens if Mr Trump makes overtures to Russia and calls for sanctions over Ukraine to be reduced? What happens if Mr Trump ends US support for Syrian rebels and orders the US military to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State group? This was the one issue of substance Messrs Trump and Putin discussed in Messrs Trump and Putin telephone call this week. And what happens if Mr Trump is true to Mr Trump ' s word and reduces the US commitment to Nato? All of these are policy choices that could see the UK not only reverse longstanding positions but also place the UK at odds with either the US or the EU. This is the context for Mrs May' s trip to Berlin on Friday where Mrs May ' s will meet President Obama and four of Mrs May ' s most important European counterparts, from Germany, France, Italy and Spain. The challenge for this untested, newly appointed prime minister will be to walk that traditional fine line between the US and Europe. Mrs May ' s has to prepare the way for these tough policy decisions, urging Europe to engage with a president - elect who cannot be ignored. But equally Mrs May ' s will be under some pressure to make it clear to the travelling Americans that Britain will not roll over and accept automatically whatever foreign policy emerges from a Trump - led Washington. The UK - US relationship is hardly special at the moment. Mr Trump has shown no hesitation at embarrassing Mrs May by giving Nigel Farage a photo - opportunity at Trump Towers, giving the impression that the UKIP leader is filling a vacuum left by the Foreign Office. Mr Obama has chosen to visit Greece and Germany and not the UK on a valedictory European tour and in a news conference described Chancellor Merkel as\" probably... Mr Obama closest international partner these eight years\". In vain did David Cameron flip those burgers in the Downing Street garden with the president. As the one time US Secretary of State Dean Acheson once wrote:\" Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America... but unique did not mean affectionate.\" So the task now for the British government is to engage with Mr Trump' s incipient administration and do what the government can - if anything - to shape and influence Mr Trump ' s foreign policy before firm positions are established. Officials recognise there is a window of opportunity in the coming weeks that should not be wasted that could set the terms for discussions about trade and security. Mrs May is pushing for an early meeting with Mr Trump before the inauguration in January. The Foreign Office is already holding talks with the Trump team about the possibility of Mr Johnson travelling to Washington to meet the Vice - President - elect, Mike Pence, and potentially others in the Trump team in the next few weeks. Officials insist that these discussions began before Mr Farage began claiming Mr Farage ambassadorial role with Mr Trump. But at the same time, the government also has to ensure that this process of engagement with the US does not make Brexit harder by losing what little political support Brexit still has in Europe' s chancelleries. The former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV this week that Britain' s focus should be on Europe.\" For the first time really, the most important decisions over the next few years are going to be about our relationship with Europe, not about our relationship with the United States,\" The former Chancellor George Osborne said. In the past few months, the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump have overturned many of Britain' s traditional foreign policy assumptions. The government needs to repair relations with both the US and the EU while not antagonising both the US and the EU in process. Falling between the two geopolitical stools would leave the UK floundering mid - Atlantic without a paddle.",

The All Party Parliamentary Group ( APPG) for Drug Policy Reform took evidence from 623 patients, professionals and experts and more than 20, 000 scientific and medical reports were reviewed.\" The results are clear. Cannabis has a medical benefit for a wide range of conditions,\" says Mike Barnes, a professor of neurological rehabilitation. However, the NHS warns that cannabis use carries a number of risks, such as impairing the ability to drive, as well as causing harm to lungs if smoked and harm to mental health, fertility or unborn babies. cannabis use can also have other serious consequences, with users potentially vulnerable to developing psychotic illnesses, the Royal College of Psychiatrists says. A Home Office spokesman said the government had no plan to legalise cannabis, adding:\" There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people' s mental and physical health.\" Yet the End Our Pain campaign, which supports the legalisation of medical cannabis, estimates that one million people across the UK rely on the drug for medical reasons. By Michelle Roberts, health editor, BBC News online. After weighing the evidence, experts say there is a clear therapeutic role for medical cannabis. There is good evidence that the drug helps alleviate the symptoms of chronic pain, MS and nausea associated with chemotherapy, as well as anxiety. But for treating other conditions, such as depression, headaches and epilepsy, there is limited or no convincing evidence that the drug works. Like any drug, cannabis can cause side effects. Smoking cannabis in a joint rolled with tobacco can make asthma worse and probably increases the risk of lung cancer. Regular cannabis use puts some people at increased risk of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, and can also reduce fertility. Cannabis is addictive and you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as cravings, difficulty sleeping, sweating and shaking. Cannabis affects how the brain works. the drug can make users feel very anxious and even paranoid, the drug can make it difficult to concentrate and learn. 37. average age of patient. 67 %. try conventional medicines first. 37 % don' t tell 37 % doctor. 72 % buy street cannabis. 20 % grow 20 % own. The United Patients Alliance says 30 % of cannabis patients surveyed by the APPG cited depression as a reason for self - medication - though patients reported multiple conditions and depression often accompanies other primary conditions. About a quarter of patients said About a quarter of patients used the drug to combat anxiety and a quarter mentioned pain. Almost 70 % of the patients surveyed said Almost 70 % of the patients surveyed had tried conventional medicines first, before turning to cannabis. Doctors told Faye Faye would have to take low dosages of cancer drugs for the rest of Faye life to deal with Faye rheumatoid arthritis. But after suffering hair loss, frequent sickness and\" brain fog\", Faye job became untenable and Faye boss took Faye aside.\" Faye' d just bought a house and had a mortgage - Faye couldn' t afford to lose Faye job,\" Faye says. Inspired by MS patients, Faye tried cannabis and now spends about £ 250 a month making Faye own capsules and creams, mixing cannabis oil and coconut oil. Faye says Faye takes the pills\" like Faye would ibuprofen, when Faye need the pills\", claiming that the low dosage is not enough to make Faye high. Along with 38 % of users surveyed by the APPG, Faye also uses a vaporiser to consume the drug. Fewer than a third smoke the drug with tobacco; one in five smokes the drug without tobacco. Others eat the drug, take capsules or use creams.

The remainder is sourced on the internet or abroad, according to those surveyed by the APPG. Penny, who has been cautioned by the police twice, estimates that Penny , who has been cautioned by the police twice spends £ 5, 000 a year on cannabis - a fraction of the £ 30, 000 annual cost of MS prescription drugs, Penny , who has been cautioned by the police twice says.

        "document": "They said the Chinese authorities had never before reported this to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( Cites). However, during the convention' s standing committee meeting in Geneva, China reportedly said that China still banned tiger bones.\" A Chinese delegate said, ' China don' t ban trade in tiger skins but China do ban trade in tiger bones, '\" a participant in the meeting said. Cites secretariat sources confirmed that a member of the Chinese delegation had said the admission from China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told the BBC Chinese Service Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang could not verify the reported admission, but Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said that China will\" investigate and combat\" any illegal trade in tiger skins. Between 5, 000 and 6, 000 tigers are believed to be in captivity in China. Wildlife conservation organisations have long demanded an end to the trade in skins. Wildlife experts believe\" tiger farming\" in China has fuelled demand for the poaching and trafficking of the endangered species elsewhere. Wildlife experts say the admission at the meeting will increase pressure on China to curb the practice. Reports also say that the facilities where the captive tigers are held have been providing live animals and parts for illegal international trade. According to officials and participants at the Cites meeting, the admission from China followed the presentation of a report which gave details of how the Chinese government had allowed commercial trade in skins from captive tigers.\" The report presented in the meeting created a situation that required China to respond,\" said a participant who did not wish to be named.\" Basically when the meeting focused on the findings of this report, the Chinese delegate intervened,\" a participant who did not wish to be named said.\" It was the first time China admitted officially that this trade exists in China.\" Participants say the admission from China created quite a sensation during the Cites meeting.\" After the Chinese intervention... the UK - based Environment Investigation Agency , which has investigated the illegal wildlife trade across the globe too intervened and made it clear that the investigations the UK - based Environment Investigation Agency , which has investigated the illegal wildlife trade across the globe have done with other organisations clearly show that the trade in China is happening on a commercial scale,\" said Shruti Suresh, a wildlife campaigner with the UK - based Environment Investigation Agency, which has investigated the illegal wildlife trade across the globe.\" The clarification was necessary because the Chinese delegate did not say that the trade in China was happening on a commercial scale, and there was a risk that the trade could later be misreported as something done for scientific research or, say, displays in the museums.\" Member countries of the Cites are required to report on what progress Member countries of the Cites have made to ensure that trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten specimens of wild animals and plants survival. A new report on illegal wildlife trade suggests that around 1, 600 tigers, both from captivity and the wild, have been traded globally since 2000. While China has been a major market for tiger parts, wildlife experts say other South East Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Lao, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia are also emerging as consumers, where tiger farming is growing. Reports say that in the past two years, there have been seizures of nearly 90 tigers likely to have been sourced from, or trafficked through, captive facilities across South East Asia and China.\" Demand - reduction efforts and enforcement and anti - trafficking activities are undermined both by the existence of facilities that keep and breed tigers for commercial purposes, and the lack of enforcement to stop trade from or through facilities that keep and breed tigers for commercial purposes,\" says a report by Species Survival Network ( SSN), whose members include more than 100 wildlife conservation organisations.\" Trade in these specimens perpetuated the desirability of tiger parts and China' s experiment in licensing the domestic trade in skins of captive tigers has done nothing to alleviate pressure on wild tigers, as evidenced through continued poaching in the wild.\" A little more than 3, 000 tigers are believed to be left in the wild across the globe. More than half of A little more than 3 , 000 tigers are in India, where 42 tigers were killed last year.\" If the Chinese government has admitted the trade in tiger skins, SP Yadav , deputy inspector general of India ' s National Tiger Conservation Authority think admitted is a forward step toward curbing illegal trade in tiger parts,\" said SP Yadav, deputy inspector general of India' s National Tiger Conservation Authority.\" Denial mode does not help solve the problem but once you accept what is happening, it' s easy to move ahead.\" The SSN report says the skins of tigers, leopards and snow leopards are valued among the political, military and business elite as luxury home decorations in China.\" The outcome of recent corruption cases in China confirm the skins of tigers , leopards and snow leopards are ' gifted ' as non - financial bribes to officials,\" the report says.

Since the fall of the US - backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, Cuba has been a one - party state led by Mr Castro and - since February 2008 - by Mr Castro chosen successor and younger brother, Raul. Fidel Castro exercised control over virtually all aspects of Cuban life through the Communist Party and the Communist Party affiliated mass organisations, the government bureaucracy and the state security apparatus. Exploiting the Cold War, Fidel Castro was for decades able to rely on strong Soviet backing, including annual subsidies worth $ 4 - 5 billion, and succeed in building reputable health and education systems. But, at least partly because of the US trade sanctions, Mr Castro failed to diversify the economy. The US and Cuba agreed in 2014 to normalise relations. Population 11. 2 million. Area 110, 860 sq km ( 42, 803 sq miles) Major language Spanish. Major religion Christianity. Life expectancy 77 years ( men), 81 years ( women) Currency Cuban peso. Raul Castro, the world' s longest - serving defence minister, took over as president in February 2008, succeeding Raul Castro , the world ' s longest - serving defence minister ailing brother Fidel, who had been in power for five decades. After being re - elected by the single - party National Assembly in February 2013, Raul announced Raul Castro , the world ' s longest - serving defence minister intention to stand down at the end of Raul Castro , the world ' s longest - serving defence minister second term in 2018. Fidel Castro brought revolution to Cuba in the 1950s and created the western hemisphere' s first Communist state. Mr Castro beard, long speeches, cigar, army fatigues and defiance of the United States earned Mr Castro iconic status across the globe. Raul, 76 at the time of this appointment, has been Raul Castro , the world ' s longest - serving defence minister brother' s trusted right - hand man and was once known as an iron - fisted ideologue who executed Fidel Castro' s orders - and enemies - ruthlessly. Under Raul Castro , the world ' s longest - serving defence minister leadership, Cuba' s Revolutionary Armed Forces became one of the most formidable fighting forces in the Third World with combat experience in Africa, where Cuba ' s Revolutionary Armed Forces defeated South Africa' s army in Angola in 1987. The Cuban media are tightly controlled by the government and journalists must operate within the confines of laws against anti - government propaganda and the insulting of officials which carry penalties of up to three years in prison. Reporters without Borders in early 2016 described Cuba as\" one of the world' s worst countries from the viewpoint of journalistsâ € ¦ independent journalists and bloggers are constantly persecuted by the Castro government\". Some key dates in Cuba' s history:. 1898 - Cuba is ceded to the US which defeated Spain in war. 1902 - Cuba becomes independent under the protection of the US. 1933 - Sergeant Fulgencio Batista seizes power in a coup. 1959 - Fidel Castro leads a guerrilla army into Havana, forcing Batista to flee. 1961 - the US breaks off diplomatic relations in response to the nationalization of US - owned properties, and later imposes a complete commercial embargo. 1961 - Cuban exiles backed by the US try to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, but are defeated. 1962 - The US and the Soviet Union have a showdown that almost touches off war after the US discovers Soviet nuclear missiles on Cuba. The confrontation ends with the Soviets removing the missiles and the US agreeing never to invade Cuba. 1975 - Castro sends troops to Angola to help fight rebels backed by South Africa. It is the start of 15 years of war in which 300, 000 Cubans will fight. 1991 - The Soviet Union, Cuba' s biggest benefactor, collapses, touching off an economic crisis. 2006 - Fidel Castro provisionally turns over power to brother Raul Castro, who becomes president in 2008. 2014 - US President Barack Obama and President Castro announce moves to normalise diplomatic relations, severed for more than 50 years.",

        "document": "The introduction of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, however, means that even if Mrs May wants to, Mrs May might not find it so easy. The Act was introduced after the 2010 election to bind together the two parts of the new coalition government. The discretion of prime ministers to pick the timing of elections was removed and the dates fixed five years apart - we are next due one on Thursday 7 May 2020. The Act provides two mechanisms by which an early election could be triggered, which are:. Taking each in turn, the government does not have the numbers on the government ' s own to achieve a two - thirds majority so any vote would depend on what the other parties do. Jeremy Corbyn has warned the Labour Party to prepare for an election next year and Newsnight reported in September that Jeremy Corbyn planned to instruct Jeremy Corbyn MPs to vote in favour of an early election if the government wanted to call one ( although planned has not been confirmed). Latest polls suggest that supporting an early election would be a mistake for Labour. It is unlikely the Scottish National Party would come to the government' s assistance in bringing about an early election. Looking at the second mechanism, if other parties do not support an early election it would be unprecedented in British politics for a government to bring about a government own downfall ( though such engineering is not unknown elsewhere) and the government voting no confidence in the government ' s could be a risky strategy. More likely is that the Fixed Term Parliaments Act could be repealed or amended, to require, for example, a simple majority of MPs in favour of an early election, though the House of Lords may have something to say about this. An amendment to existing legislation seems more straightforward than trying to reintroduce the prerogative power to call elections. In short, the calling of an early election would require either a change in the law, or some unusual parliamentary gymnastics.",

Alain Juppe insisted Mr Juppe , once the favourite seen as the safe choice proposals were\" deep and credible\" but lacked the\" brutality\" of Mr Fillon' s plans. It was the final Republicans party debate before Sunday' s concluding vote. The Republicans candidate is widely expected to face far - right National Front ( FN) leader Marine Le Pen in a runoff vote in the presidential election next May. Self - declared supporters of the centre - right values are choosing between the two former prime ministers. Sunday ' s concluding vote is the party' s first such primary vote, modelled on the US system. Seven candidates were whittled down to two last Sunday, with Mr Fillon taking an unexpectedly decisive lead of 44. 1 % to Mr Juppe' s 28. 5 %. Juppe v Fillon: Battle of France' s conservatives. Press review: France' s ' Mr Nobody ' Francois Fillon. Fillon under fire over women' s rights. The past week has seen a campaign marked by a bitter row over the nature Mr Fillon' s social policies. Mr Juppe provoked a furious reaction when Mr Juppe , once the favourite seen as the safe choice questioned whether Mr Fillon, a Roman Catholic, could seek to challenge the legality of abortion. But polling suggests such tactics seem to have backfired on Mr Juppe, once the favourite seen as the safe choice. A poll of 908 debate viewers by Elabe suggested 71 % of conservative respondents found Mr Fillon more convincing, as did 57 % of viewers of all political stripes.\" It is true that France ' s ' Mr Nobody ' Francois Fillon project is more radical and perhaps more difficult,\" said Mr Fillon. France ' s ' Mr Nobody ' Francois Fillon controversial economic reforms include cutting half a million public sector jobs and scrapping the 35 - hour work week, prompting comparisons to the late British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Mr Juppe also proposes cutting jobs and liberalising work hours, though to a lesser extent. Both propose roughly similar cuts to public spending of at least â ‚ ¬ 100bn ( Â £ 85bn; $ 106bn).\" France ' s ' Mr Nobody ' Francois Fillon' ve got a plan for the reforms France ' s ' Mr Nobody ' Francois Fillon want to make in the first three months of the presidential term - and France ' s ' Mr Nobody ' Francois Fillon' m convinced if we don' t get these changes implemented in the first three months, the French people will feel disheartened, the French people' ll turn away from politics, and then there' ll be a greater risk of the extremists winning,\" Mr Fillon said. The country was\" on the brink of revolt\", which could only be averted with such radical action. Conservative Le Figaro says the debate\" eased tensions on the right\" and showed the two contenders\" have already formed identical visions and almost similar projects\" - in particular the need to end the\" vicious cycle of spending and debt\". the two contenders have\" some differences on security, education and migration, but some differences on security , education and migration are minor\", concludes Conservative Le Figaro political editor. But centre - left Le Monde' s political correspondent disagrees, seeing\" significant differences\" on the European Union, Russia and Syria. While Mr Fillon wants to\" respect the sovereignty\" of EU member states, Mr Juppe favours a\" powerful EU as a future world power\". On Syria, Mr Fillon wants to put France\" back in play\" by\" opening a channel to Damascus\", whereas Mr Juppe wants to\" boost transatlantic co - operation\" and takes a firm line against President Bashar al - Assad, Le Monde says. Left - wing Liberation writes that the debate between\" Fillon the radical and Juppe the reconciler\" was\" knotty, often tense, but not aggressive\".

The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons ( NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care ( Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust.

With three of last year' s semi - finalists alongside the Sharks in Pool One the Salford - based side were always going to be big outsiders to qualify, and with a solitary point from two games the knock - out stages look impossible now. the Salford - based side enjoyed some good moments, with David Seymour a constant menace at the breakdown, but ultimately the hosts had too much power and class. Fly - half Cipriani, playing Danny Cipriani first game since being left out of the England squad, mixed lovely touches with a couple of careless mistakes, but along with the rest of Danny Cipriani side Danny Cipriani was powerless to prevent the Clermont onslaught after the break. Despite trailing by 10 points at the interval Sale were competitive in the first half and it took a poor throw at the line - out - far from the last unfortunately for the visitors - to spark Clermont into life. Wales centre Jonathan Davies - who immediately went off with a reported shoulder injury - chipped and regathered before feeding Abendanon, who scooted down the line and produced a piston - like hand - off on Sale scrum - half Will Cliff to score. Lopez, 25, converted and added two penalties after Cipriani' s solitary reply for Sale as the hosts edged clear. After the break Clermont grew more dominant by the minute and added a second try when the giant Nalaga claimed Lopez' s cross - kick and stepped inside two covering defenders to score. The Fijian powerhouse added a second with 10 minutes remaining after a flowing passing move and, with the passionate home fans demanding a fourth try, the 34 - year - old Rougerie dummied on halfway, handed off Tom Arscott and outpaced the Sale defence to score in the corner.

Suspect Jaber al - Bakr gave elite commandos the slip over the weekend, sparking a two - day manhunt. Police believe Mr Bakr was planning to bomb a Berlin airport.

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. With all the results now declared, Jac Larner of Cardiff University sums up the night for Wales ' five main parties. WELSH LABOUR. Labour have exceeded all expectations in Wales. Labour ' s have outperformed every single Wales - only poll over the course of the campaign - and the exit poll - achieving Labour ' s highest share of the vote in Wales since 1997. Not only did Labour ' s successfully defend Labour ' s 25 seats, but Labour ' s gained three seats from the Conservatives, taking Labour ' s total to 28 in Wales. This is Labour ' s best performance in terms of seat share since 2005, and Labour ' s best performance in terms of share of the Wales vote since the New Labour landslide of 1997. This extends Labour ' s run of winning general elections in Wales to 26 in a row. WELSH CONSERVATIVES. The Conservatives also saw the Conservatives vote share increase across Wales by 6. 3 %, but increase was not enough for the Conservatives to hold off Labour' s surge in Wales. Early in the night the Conservatives were confident about gaining seats in Bridgend, Newport West and in the north east of Wales, so a net loss of 3 seats will be a big disappointment. Historically, the Conservatives have always performed worse in Wales than in England at every election going back to 1859, and this election looks to be no different. PLAID CYMRU. It was a strange night for Plaid Cymru that ended in success with the election of Plaid Cymru youngest ever MP, Ben Lake. Plaid Cymru increased Plaid Cymru parliamentary representation, taking Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru vote held up where Plaid Cymru were defending the three seats won in 2015. Plaid Cymru group of four MPs is the party' s largest Westminster cohort since the 2001 general election. Yet Plaid Cymru vote share fell nationally by 1. 7 % and Plaid Cymru lost votes in Plaid Cymru other target seats of Ynys Mon, Llanelli and Rhondda. However, Plaid will view Plaid Cymru as one of the few winners in this election on a night where smaller parties saw smaller parties vote share squeezed across the UK. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. The Liberal Democrats ' torrid time at elections in Wales continues. the Lib Dem ' s won the Lib Dem ' s worst ever share of the vote in the party' s history in Wales, and lost the Lib Dem ' s solo MP Mark Williams in Ceredigion to Plaid Cymru. With only one AM in Wales, and limited representation in local government in Wales, the Liberal Democrats can no longer be considered to be a significant political player in the country. It is the first time since the founding of one of the Lib Dem' s predecessor party, the Liberals, in 1859 that the Lib Dem ' s will have no Westminster representation in Wales. UKIP. UKIP' s vote share has collapsed considerably across Wales, polling 11. 6 % less than 2015 after 38 constituencies had been called. Opinion polling across the campaign suggested that around two - thirds of the 2015 UKIP vote would go to the Conservatives. From the results we have seen so far, it seems that a significant proportion of these voters have voted for Labour in Wales.",

        "document": "It is a talent that helped Mr Chase move from being bankrupt, aged 32, to becoming a multimillionaire by the time Mr Chase was 48. Along the way Mr Chase created and sold best - selling upmarket crisps brand Tyrrells, and won a high - profile battle against supermarket giant Tesco. Now 56, and the founder and owner of Chase Vodka, a luxury version of the spirit made from potatoes grown on Mr Chase farm, the serial entrepreneur says:\" People love stories, the real stories behind things.\" And the media was very important to Mr Chase from the first days of Tyrrells.\" Mr Chase was a guy who had been beaten up by the supermarkets, and people love to support the underdog.\" The son of potato farmers who lived near the Herefordshire town of Leominster, Mr Chase bought the family farm from Mr Chase dad when Mr Chase was 20 after Mr Chase\" managed to find a bank manager brave enough to lend Mr Chase £ 200, 000\". As the cost of potatoes can rise and fall sharply, business was up and down for the next 12 years, until torrential rain in 1992 meant Mr Chase couldn' t harvest Mr Chase crop, which Mr Chase had to leave to rot in the fields. Overextended financially, the business collapsed, and Mr Chase had to file for bankruptcy. Mr Chase says:\" Mr Chase was very ashamed and embarrassed.\" After\" running away to Australia\" for a few months, Mr Chase returned to Herefordshire, and was able to borrow funds to buy back the farm from the receivers, and start up in business again. This time, to make extra money, Mr Chase became a potato trader, buying spuds from a number of farms, and then selling spuds on to supermarkets. Yet while Mr Chase got Mr Chase back on Mr Chase feet financially, Mr Chase says Mr Chase became increasingly frustrated that supermarkets would reject potatoes that weren' t\" cosmetically perfect\". Mr Chase adds:\" Mr Chase' d send off 10 loads of spuds every day, and Mr Chase' d be getting five back. It was very painful how the supermarkets were treating us farmers.\" Mr Chase' s life - changing moment came in 2002 when Mr Chase found out that rejected potatoes were being bought up by the UK operation of US crisp - maker Kettle. At the time Kettle was one of new companies making so - called\" posh crisps\", potato crisps which were cut a little thicker than the mass - market brands, and fried by hand. Despite having no crisp - making experience or knowledge, Mr Chase was convinced Mr Chase could set up Mr Chase own upmarket crisps brand. So Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder phoned a few UK crisp - makers to ask if Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder could see how a few UK crisp - makers did things, and a few UK crisp - makers said\" no\". Undeterred, Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder flew out to the US and visited facilities in Pennsylvania and Colorado. Returning to the UK, Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder built a crisp - making facility at the family farm, and Tyrrells [ taking Tyrrells [ taking its name from the property ] name from the property] was up and running six months later. Quick to tell Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder story to local newspapers to build up publicity, Mr Chase hit the road to spend two weeks visiting independent food shops across the UK with samples of Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder crisps. Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder says:\" Tyrrells grew and grew very quickly, and Tyrrells [ taking its name from the property ] was a brilliant cash cow. Tyrrells [ taking its name from the property ]' d sell the bags to shops for £ 1 and shops would retail the bags for £ 2. For Tyrrells [ taking its name from the property ] the net profit was 35 %.\" Supermarkets such as Waitrose soon followed suit, but Mr Chase was adamant that Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder would not sell to the largest - Tesco - because Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder didn' t like what Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder saw as the pressure Tesco put on farmers to lower farmers prices. Then one day in 2006 a friend told Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder that Tesco was selling Tyrrells ' crisps. It transpired that Tesco had been buying Tyrrells ' crisps on the grey market, and selling Tyrrells ' crisps below the recommended retail price. An incensed Mr Chase demanded that Tesco stop selling Tyrrells ' crisps. After the supermarket refused, Mr Chase started a media campaign that included an appearance on BBC Radio 4' s Today programme. Tesco then did back down. With sales of Tyrrells crisps continuing to grow over the next few years, and annual turnover hitting £ 14m, Mr Chase borrowed money from Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder bank to expand production. The condition the bank set was that Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder had to bring in a management team to help Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder run the business. Mr Chase, who had previously been very hands on, and liked to help out with all parts of the business, says that bringing in new managers ultimately changed the business - to Tyrrells [ taking its name from the property ] detriment.\" Tyrrells [ taking its name from the property ] got to a stage where Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder didn' t like where the business was going,\" Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder says.\" Tyrrells [ taking its name from the property ] were employing corporate people who were arranging meetings about more meetings.\" Unhappy with Tyrrells ' new big business ethos, and going through a\" messy divorce\", Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder - decided to sell up in 2008 to a private capital business for almost £ 40m. Looking for a new business venture, and with the new owners of Tyrrells choosing to buy the new owners of Tyrrells potatoes from elsewhere, Mr Chase came up with the idea of turning Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder spuds into premium vodka. So with money no longer a problem, Mr Chase bought a distillation system, and Chase Vodka was born. Aimed at the luxury end of the market, Chase Vodka retails for £ 35 a bottle. While Mr Chase admits it isn' t anywhere near as profitable as selling crisps, it appears to be very much a labour of love. And focused very much on exports, Mr Chase spends a lot of time travelling the world to build up sales. And showing that Mr Chase has lost little of Mr Chase public relations skills, every year Mr Chase flies influential barmen and women from around the world to visit Mr Chase farm in Herefordshire to see how the potatoes are grown, and vodka is made. Also now making a gin and a whisky, the Chase Distillery sells 10, 000 bottles a week. Mr Chase says:\" You have to tell people your story if you want to build your brand. But there has to be real DNA behind your brand if you want to be successful.\"",

The Venezuelan president has blamed President Maduro country' s economic crisis on an axis of enemy forces co - ordinated from the US. During a three - hour long news conference on Tuesday, Mr Maduro had justified President Maduro declaration of a state of emergency by saying Venezuela was under attack from imperialist forces led by the CIA.

But Mr Maduro' s deputy, Vice - President Aristobulo Isturiz, on Sunday ruled out such a referendum, saying the signatures were\" fraudulent\". Mr Almagro said that not letting the referendum go ahead made Mr Maduro\" another petty dictator\". While President Maduro did not answer Mr Almagro' s tweets directly, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez did. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez wrote,\" Mr Almagro, every time Mr Almagro , who before leading the OAS was the foreign minister of his native Uruguay make a statement Mr Almagro , who before leading the OAS was the foreign minister of his native Uruguay express Mr Almagro , who before leading the OAS was the foreign minister of his native Uruguay hatred against Venezuela and Venezuela legitimate authorities.

A new opinion poll indicates that Mr Macron and Mr Fillon are neck and neck in the race for the all - important second place in the first round - with Mr Macron and Mr Fillon on about 19 %. According to the same poll, taken before the alliance was announced, Mr Bayrou would net 5. 5 % while Ms Le Pen would take 26 %.

But rising cotton and wool prices mean it is unlikely that uniform prices can fall any further, Neil Saunders, of Verdict Research, said. The big four UK supermarket chains - Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury' s and Morrisons - as well as Marks and Spencer, are selling the constituent parts of a generic school uniform for less than £ 5 each. For example, Asda is selling a white shirt for £ 1, Sainsbury' s has put a £ 2 price tag on grey and black trousers, and Tesco has blue and green sweaters on sale for £ 1. 75. Although labour costs are low as many of these items are manufactured in Bangladesh and China, the margin for these items is still extremely slim. The supermarkets accept is owing to the brand loyalty The big four UK supermarket chains - Asda , Tesco , Sainsbury ' s and Morrisons - gain from customers, who buy uniforms at cheap prices and then stay in the store to buy other goods such as school accessories and groceries. The price war is unusual and prices for many other items are rising. Plus - size school uniforms launch. The picture is also different for parents who must buy uniforms from specialist suppliers. Owing to prescriptive demands of these uniforms, prices tend to be higher than the generic supermarket clothes. Verdict Research estimates the UK school uniform market to be worth £ 694m. The average price of a standard uniform has fallen by almost 21 % since 2004, Verdict Research said, with supermarkets increasing supermarkets market share. However, the total value of uniform and equipment sales has fallen from £ 861m in 2004 to £ 694m, the research group said. Neil Saunders, of Verdict, said that the quality of uniforms tended not to be at the same level as a decade ago.\" As long as uniforms last, parents are not too concerned,\" Neil Saunders , of Verdict Research said.\" Children run around in these things, rip holes in these things, and these things fall apart anyway. As long as it lasts a term or half a year, parents are quite satisfied with lasts.\" Neil Saunders , of Verdict Research added that because wholesale prices of cotton and wool were rising, it would be difficult to cut prices any further.

        "document": "It was relief more than real jubilation. The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about expectations. At one point a rumour swept the gathering that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu' d lost more than a third of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alliance' s seats in the Knesset - in the end the exit polls suggested lost would be more like a quarter. Cue wild celebration. If you add together Mr Netanyahu' s natural allies among the religious parties and the rest of the right - and assume Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu' ll be able to attract at least one party from the centre or even the left - then Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be able to form a government again. Senior Likud figure Danny Danon was quick to tell me that the only thing that would be remembered from this night was the fact that Senior Likud figure Danny Danon boss had won a third term as prime minister.\" There is only one prime minister possible for Israel from these results. And only one prime minister possible for Israel from these results' s Benjamin Netanyahu.\" Senior Likud figure Danny Danon say to Senior Likud figure Danny Danon friends here on the left that my friends here on the left should not be opening the champagne after these results.\" Any champagne that Mr Netanyahu may be tempted to open will be feeling a little flat though. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emerges from these elections a rather diminished figure, whose wheeling and dealing skills may be sorely tested as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sets about building a new coalition. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to a crowd of activists in Tel Aviv Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was measured, although it took Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu some time to persuade Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supporters to stop celebrating long enough to make Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu heard.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu am going to seek as broad a government as possible\", Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu' m going to seek out many partners.\" That was perhaps Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu way of acknowledging that the overall results of the night were curiously ambiguous. To the left of Mr Netanyahu, Labour picked up seats but to the right of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu so did Habayit Hayehudi ( Jewish Home party) led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu former chief of staff Naftali Bennett. The undoubted star of the evening was Yair Lapid, a famous TV presenter who stepped off the screen to found a new centrist party called Yesh Atid ( There is a Future). It has been an extraordinary debut. The party may well emerge as the second largest grouping in the new Knesset and should command a place in a Netanyahu - led coalition. Because Mr Lapid is a political newcomer, it' s hard to say what price Yair Lapid , a famous TV presenter who stepped off the screen to found a new centrist party called Yesh Atid ( There is a Future ) might try to extract in return for Yair Lapid , a famous TV presenter who stepped off the screen to found a new centrist party called Yesh Atid ( There is a Future ) support. But you can expect a higher profile for the vexed issue of whether Israel' s ultra - Orthodox community ought to be required to perform Israel ' s ultra - Orthodox community share of national service ( Israel ' s ultra - Orthodox community' s currently exempt). The wider world will examine these results for clues about Israel' s future attitude towards peace talks with the Palestinians or the possibility of a pre - emptive strike on Iran' s nuclear facilities. The truth of the matter is that it' s far too early to make those kind of judgements, which will depend on the balance of forces within a future coalition more than on the outcome of the popular vote. But the sudden and decisive lurch to the right that many predicted hasn' t happened. The results show that there' s plenty of life on the left and the centre of Israeli politics too. Some political journalists at Likud headquarters were arguing within hours of the exit polls that the results sent such a confused signal about the political mood in Israel that these results made another election likely within a year. We' ll see. Having said these results is a chastening result for Benjamin Netanyahu it' s only fair to record that these results' s been a thought provoking one for anyone in the business of making political predictions here, too. Mr Netanyahu was supposed to win easily - and Mr Netanyahu certainly didn' t. And the campaign was supposed to have failed to capture the Israeli imagination - and turnout was remarkably high. It' s said to take an average of well over a month to form a coalition government after polling day here - and there' s no reason to assume that form will be any quicker than the average this time around. The first contacts between party leaders were probably under way before the celebrations at Likud HQ had died away. Israel and the wider Middle East must now wait to see what sort of government will eventually emerge.",

Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180, 000 to 65, 000 a year. But James McGrory, from the pro - EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report\" disingenuous\". James McGrory , from the pro - EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign said The report from Migration Watch , which advocates tighter immigration controls was\" another example of fudging the facts\". The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not the UK should remain a member of the European Union. The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU impact on overall migration figures. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw. No - one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration. It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place. But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that the UK did herald controls on the flow of low - skilled EU migrant labour, would controls on the flow of low - skilled EU migrant labour really work in reducing net migration? Wouldn' t there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force? Wouldn' t businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf - stackers from Europe demand that businesses that currently rely on labourers , chambermaids and supermarket shelf - stackers from Europe be allowed to recruit labourers , chambermaids and supermarket shelf - stackers from Europe from elsewhere? And wouldn' t the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK? These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum. The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher - skilled workers, higher - skilled workers family members and students, while low - skilled workers would not be granted entry. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said:\" It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes.\" Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would\" continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future\", Lord Green of Deddington , chairman of Migration Watch said.\" Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as immigrants friends and relatives join immigrants in immigrants new countries,\" Lord Green of Deddington , chairman of Migration Watch said.\" Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and net migration resultant pressure on our population and public services.\" The 16 - page paper suggests that on average only about 20 % of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher - skilled work. It said:\" the suggested system could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of the EU inflow for work recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100, 000 a year from the current level of 180, 000.\" The figures should not be taken as a\" precise estimate\" but were\" intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined\", It said. There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded. Those who are\" self - sufficient\" would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs. Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join British citizens, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK. Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK existing rights, Migration Watch suggested. However, pro - EU campaigner Mr McGrory said:\" Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. the UK have an opt - out from the passport - free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market.\" The Leave campaigns haven' t produced a shred of evidence to show how The Leave campaigns could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if the UK left.\" The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers employers may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe.

The move also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had\" ironclad information\" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and\" pushed hard\" for a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was\" just not true\", but A US state department spokesman hoped the resolution would\" serve as a wake - up call\" for Israel. More than 500, 000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel' s 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes considered. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements\" has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two - state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\". Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC' s Yolande Knell said Israel ' s was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which Israel ' s sees as part of Israel ' s capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of the Palestinians future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel' s ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine' s prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC postponed was at the request of the prime minister' s office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry' s speech.\" It' s in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" planning committee member Hanan Rubin said.\" The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry' s speech today, The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee are looking to avoid this conflict.\" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out Mr Kerry vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel - Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as\" misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government.

Across the seven schools involved throughout Scotland, 374 children receive up to 10 hours a week specialised coaching as part of 374 children everyday studies.\" There' s been a lot of time invested in this project by a lot of people and we' re looking at how we continue to improve the programme as we travel through the years,\" McClair told BBC Scotland. The project is now in the SFA project fourth year, with this year' s intake of pupils the final one of the initial scheme. McClair will decide in the coming months whether the SFA project will continue in the SFA project current format once an analysis of how the SFA project is working has been concluded. Alternatives could include certificating the programme to award pupils a Higher qualification for completing the course or focusing on a smaller group of children at one single, residential campus rather than the seven schools involved just now. At the very least, the current system will continue until this year' s S1 pupils have completed fourth year. Gauging the SFA project success thus far is tricky, with the oldest participants still only in S4, but McClair believes there are some good indicators.\" The SFA ' s performance director think you can be encouraged by the number of young people who have been in the performance schools who have been in the younger representative squads over the last three - and - a - bit years and the evidence suggests the number of young people who have been in the performance schools who have been in the younger representative squads over the last three - and - a - bit years will continue,\" The SFA ' s performance director added.\" By summertime The SFA ' s performance director think it' ll be a half - decent measure of the number of young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full - time football, although The SFA ' s performance director believe the number of young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full - time football' s changing a little bit in the sense that it' s 16 or 17 that some clubs are looking at taking young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full - time football in full - time.\" The idea' s great. Many clubs in England have taken The idea on board - getting kids in during the day, giving kids more opportunities to practise the disciplines involved in football.\" The evidence is all there that kids' re improving quicker than kids were previously under a hybrid programme where all the coaching was taking place in the evening or at weekends.\" The other important gauge of success is academic achievement. Exam results will not be available from the SFA project until this summer, but Graeme High School in Falkirk ran a pilot scheme - of which Craig Sibbald and Celtic youngster Paul McMullan are graduates - that allows for some analysis. \" Last year we had a group of 14 or 15 and the vast majority were highly successful, able pupils, one with five Highers, two with four Highers, three with three Highers and a suite of other academic achievements,\" headteacher Lesley Carroll told BBC Scotland.\" Most of the performance school students have gone on to professional clubs but Most of them have got a fallback position. the performance school students have been some of our top - performing academic pupils too because not only do the performance school students have to be elite athlete footballers, the performance school students have to have what the SFA would call a growth mindset.\" the performance school students' re not afraid of targets, hard work, commitment, drive and confidence.\" Indeed, Carroll believes there is an argument the programme helps the performance school students achieve better results in the performance school students other subjects, though headteacher Lesley Carroll admits no\" real forensic research has been done into helps\".

The battle has been hugely disruptive for Bilkis Bano ' s family. In the past 15 years, Bilkis Bano ' s and Bilkis Bano ' s husband Yakub Rasool have moved home 10 times, moving in and out of Gujarat with she and her husband Yakub Rasool five children.\" she and her husband Yakub Rasool still can' t go home because she and her husband Yakub Rasool' re afraid. Police and the state administration have always helped our attackers. When she and her husband Yakub Rasool are in Gujarat, she and her husband Yakub Rasool still cover our faces, she and her husband Yakub Rasool never give out our address,\" Mr Rasool said. The attack on Bilkis Bano and Bilkis Bano ' s family was one of the most horrific crimes during the riots, which began when a fire on a passenger train in Godhra town killed 60 Hindu pilgrims. Blaming Muslims for starting the fire, Hindu mobs went on a rampage, attacking Muslim neighbourhoods and destroying Muslim neighbourhoods property. For three days the rioters had free rein, as the state administration and the police looked the other way. More than 1, 000 people died, most of More than 1 , 000 people Muslims. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was then Gujarat chief minister, was criticised for not doing enough to prevent the carnage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who was then Gujarat chief minister has always denied any wrongdoing and has not apologised for the riots. A Supreme Court panel also refused to prosecute Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who was then Gujarat chief minister in 2013, citing insufficient evidence. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who was then Gujarat chief minister' s never been able to shake off the criticism completely, with many holding Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who was then Gujarat chief minister responsible for the killings on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who was then Gujarat chief minister watch. Over the years, the courts have convicted dozens of people for dozens of people involvement in the riots. In 2012 an ex - minister and aide to Mr Modi was jailed for 28 years. But many other people are still waiting for justice. Fifteen years later, Bilkis Bano still fights back tears as Bilkis Bano recounts the horror of those days. Bilkis Bano was visiting Bilkis Bano parents, who lived in a village called Randhikpur, not far from Godhra. Bilkis Bano was 19 and the mother of a three - year - old daughter, and Bilkis Bano was pregnant with Bilkis Bano second child.\" It was the morning after the train fire. Bilkis Bano was in the kitchen, making lunch, when Bilkis Bano aunt and my aunt children came running. my aunt and her children said my aunt and her children homes were being set on fire and our had to leave immediately,\" Bilkis Bano said.\" our left with just the clothes our were wearing, our didn' t even have the time to put on our slippers.\" Within minutes, all the Muslim homes in the neighbourhood had emptied. The 50 - odd families that lived there had gone, looking for safety. Bilkis Bano was in a group of 17 people that included Bilkis Bano three - year - old daughter, Bilkis Bano mother, a pregnant cousin, Bilkis Bano younger siblings, nieces and nephews, and two adult men.\" the group first went to the village council head, a Hindu, seeking the village council head , a Hindu protection. But when the mobs began threatening to kill the village council head , a Hindu too if the village council head , a Hindu gave shelter to Muslims, the group were forced to leave.\" For the next few days, the group travelled from village to village, seeking shelter in a mosque, or subsisting on the kindness of Hindu neighbours. But then the group time ran out. On the morning of 3 March, as the group set out to go to a nearby village where the group believed the group would be safer, a group of men travelling in two jeeps stopped the group.\" a group of men travelling in two jeeps attacked the group with swords and sticks. One of a group of men travelling in two jeeps snatched Bilkis Bano daughter from Bilkis Bano lap and threw my daughter on the ground, bashing my daughter head into a rock.\" Bilkis Bano had cuts on Bilkis Bano hands and legs. Bilkis Bano ' s attackers were Bilkis Bano ' s neighbours in the village, 12 men Bilkis Bano ' s had seen almost daily while growing up. her attackers tore off Bilkis Bano ' s clothes and several of her attackers raped Bilkis Bano ' s. Bilkis Bano ' s begged her attackers for mercy and told her attackers Bilkis Bano ' s was five months ' pregnant, but Bilkis Bano ' s pleas fell on deaf ears. Bilkis Bano ' s cousin, who had delivered a baby girl two days earlier while they were on the run, was raped and murdered. Her cousin , who had delivered a baby girl two days earlier while they were on the run newborn was killed too. Bilkis Bano survived because Bilkis Bano ' s lost consciousness and Bilkis Bano ' s attackers left, believing Bilkis Bano ' s was dead. Two boys - seven and four - were the only other survivors of the massacre. When Bilkis Bano ' s came to, Bilkis Bano ' s covered Bilkis Bano ' s body with a blood - soaked petticoat, climbed a nearby hill and hid in a cave for a day.\" The next day Bilkis Bano ' s was very thirsty so Bilkis Bano ' s came down to a nearby tribal village to find some water. The villagers were initially suspicious of Bilkis Bano ' s and came out with sticks, but then The villagers helped Bilkis Bano ' s. The villagers gave Bilkis Bano ' s a blouse and a scarf to cover Bilkis Bano ' s body.\" Bilkis Bano ' s spotted a police jeep and they took Bilkis Bano ' s to the police station, where Bilkis Bano ' s narrated Bilkis Bano ' s ordeal.\" Bilkis Bano ' s' m illiterate so Bilkis Bano ' s asked the policemen to read out the complaint once the policemen had written the complaint down, but the policemen refused to do read. the policemen just took Bilkis Bano ' s thumb impression and wrote whatever the policemen wanted. Bilkis Bano ' s knew all Bilkis Bano ' s attackers and Bilkis Bano ' s' d named her attackers. But the police did not write down any names,\" Bilkis Bano ' s said. The next day, Bilkis Bano ' s was sent to a camp in Godhra set up for those displaced by the riots. a camp in Godhra set up for those displaced by the riots' s where Bilkis Bano ' s husband was reunited with Bilkis Bano ' s 15 days later and where the couple lived for the next few months. Bilkis Bano ' s unborn child survived the rape and Bilkis Bano ' s later gave birth to a daughter. The past 15 years have been\" very difficult\", but the couple say the high court order has brought the couple some closure. In the past few days, comparisons have been drawn between Bilkis Bano' s case and that of the 2012 gang - rape and murder of a 23 - year - old student on a bus in the Indian capital, Delhi. A day after the Bilkis Bano judgement, the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentences of the four men accused of the crime. Many have since asked whether Bilkis Bano' s case did not merit the death penalty for Bilkis Bano ' s attackers. Prosecutors had demanded capital punishment for three of the men. Bilkis Bano, however, says Bilkis Bano ' s does not believe in revenge.\" Both the crimes were equally horrible, but Bilkis Bano ' s don' t believe in taking anyone' s life. I don' t want the death penalty for them,\" I said.\" I want them to spend them entire lives in jail. I hope them will one day realise the enormity of them crime, how them killed small children and raped women.\" I' m not interested in revenge. I just want them to understand what them' ve done.\"",

The attack happened early on Sunday near the town of Dogubayezit in Agri province, near the border with Iran. Since 24 July, Turkey has carried out hundreds of air raids on PKK bases on both sides of the Iraq - Turkey border. A Turkish state news agency, Anadolu, said the tractor was carrying two tons of explosives that were detonated by a suicide bomber. Turkey' s army said in a statement that\" long - range guns\" were also found. Four of the injured were in a serious condition. The statement said the Karabulak Gendarmerie Station was hit at around 03: 00 local time on Sunday ( midnight GMT). Images in the Turkish press showed a badly - damaged building with the roof destroyed. One report said the blast was so strong that houses in a village several hundred metres away were hit by debris and some residents were slightly injured. The Dogan news agency added that militants also set up ambushes on roads to prevent medical teams getting to the scene. There has been no comment from the PKK so far. AFP news agency said it would be the first time the group was accused of deploying a suicide bomber during recent clashes. Turkey says the group was behind a number of attacks in the last two weeks:. Turkey' s official news agency says about 260 Kurdish fighters have been killed in strikes in northern Iraq and Turkey since 24 July. Turkey ' s has also targeted positions held by the Islamic State group. At least six people were killed and several wounded in further Turkish air strikes on Saturday east of Erbil, said local officials. The pro - PKK Firat news agency described an attack on the village of Zerkel as a\" massacre\". Iraqi Kurdish President Massoud Barzani said:\" We condemn the bombing, which led to the martyrdom of the citizens of the Kurdish region, and We call on Turkey to not repeat the bombing of civilians.\" The Turkish military on Sunday said Turkey ' s army had investigated the incident and dismissed claims that there could have been civilian casualties in Zerkel, Reuters reported. Turkey considers both the PKK and IS terrorist organisations. The PKK has been fighting Turkey for an autonomous homeland for the Kurds. More than 40, 000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced since the PKK began an armed uprising in 1984. In 2012, the government and PKK began peace talks and the following year a ceasefire was agreed. However, the ceasefire ended in effect when Turkey launched raids against Kurdish separatist camps in northern Iraq last month. The raids came after the PKK reportedly killed two Turkish police officers in retaliation for an attack claimed by Islamic State and what the PKK sees as Turkey' s collaboration with IS.",

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. They are young and clever, and They want to change the world - one bus at a time.\" Team Fast , a spin - off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands' ve created the world' s first bus that runs on formic acid, which is a much cheaper solution than hydrogen, yet formic acid , which is a much cheaper solution than hydrogen , yet it delivers the same environmental benefits , \" says Lucas van Cappellen from Team Fast , a spin - off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands delivers the same environmental benefits,\" says Lucas van Cappellen from Team Fast, a spin - off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.\" Team Fast , a spin - off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands' re building our own future.\" Around 40 of Lucas van Cappellen from Team Fast , a spin - off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands fellow students are endeavouring to develop emissions - free transport that will help in the global battle against climate change. And Around 40 of his fellow students' re also trying to create careers for Around 40 of his fellow students. Formic acid is found in nature, delivered in the stings and bites of ants and other insects - the Latin word for ant is formica. And this simple carboxylic acid ( chemical formula HCOOH) is already used in textiles and leather processing, as a livestock feed preservative, and is also found in some household limescale removers. But Team Fast has found a way the acid can efficiently carry the ingredients needed for hydrogen fuel cells, used to power electric vehicles. The fuel, which the team has dubbed hydrozine ( not to be confused with hydrazine), is a liquid, which means you can transport formic acid , which is a much cheaper solution than hydrogen , yet it delivers the same environmental benefits , \" says Lucas van Cappellen from Team Fast , a spin - off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands easily and refill vehicles quickly, as with conventional fuels. The difference is that formic acid , which is a much cheaper solution than hydrogen , yet it delivers the same environmental benefits , \" says Lucas van Cappellen from Team Fast , a spin - off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands is much cleaner.\" The tailpipe emissions are only CO2 and water,\" explains Mr van Cappellen.\" No other harmful gases like nitric oxides, soot or sulphuric oxides are emitted.\" To prove the concept in the real world, an electric bus is set to hit the road in the Netherlands later this year, where the bus will shuttle between running on conventional bus routes and appearing at promotional events and industry fairs. The bus has an electric drive system, developed by bus builder VDL, that receives additional power from the formic acid fuel cell system mounted in a range - extender trailer, towed behind.\" Our tank is around 300 litres, so we will extend the range of the bus by 200km ( 180 miles). However, Team Fast , a spin - off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands could of course make the tank bigger very easily,\" says Mr van Cappellen. Current hydrogen fuel cell buses have a range of up to 400km. But why develop a bus rather than a car?\" If Team Fast , a spin - off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands built a car, Team Fast , a spin - off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands would compete with electric cars, but Team Fast , a spin - off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands believe battery - powered cars are a good solution for a lot of people,\" says Mr van Cappellen. \" But if Team Fast prove that Team Fast can build a bus that meets the needs of bus companies, with a range of around 400km and quick refuelling, Team Fast will have shown the potential of hydrozine in a segment where there is no sustainable competition yet.\" Hydrozine is created through a chemical reaction between water ( H2O) and carbon dioxide ( CO2). More Technology of Business.\" In a reactor, water and CO2 are bonded using sustainable electricity. bonded is a direct, sustainable electrochemical process,\" explains Mr van Cappellen. The hydrozine is then broken down by a catalyst into hydrogen and carbon dioxide inside a piece of kit called a reformer that Team Fast is attempting to patent. Team Fast newly designed reformer is a tenth of the size of reformers of the past, which is why\" a piece of kit called a reformer that Team Fast is attempting to patent is now applicable in transport applications for the first time\". The hydrogen is then added to a fuel cell where hydrogen reacts with oxygen to generate the electricity that powers the electric motor.\" VDL Enabling Transport Solutions are continuously looking for new technologies that can extend the range of zero emissions traffic in a simple way,\" says Menno Kleingeld, managing director, VDL Enabling Transport Solutions.\" The decomposition of formic acid into hydrogen gas is one of these new, promising technologies.\" But does it really stand a chance of becoming commercially viable?\" It costs about 35, 000 euros ( Â £ 30, 000) to convert a conventional petrol filling station to a hydrozine filling station, a process that essentially involves replacing the pipes and coating the tanks,\" says Mr van Cappellen. As such, it is\" 100 times cheaper\" to roll out a fuelling network for hydrozine than for gaseous hydrogen, Mr van Cappellen maintains.\" Hydrozine is currently cheaper than petrol and more expensive than diesel in the Netherlands, and in future Team Fast expect prices to come down so Hydrozine will be cheaper than both,\" Mr van Cappellen adds. Although the bus emits CO2, Team Fast argues that the original CO2 used to create the hydrozine is taken from existing sources, such as air or exhaust fumes, so that no additional CO2 is produced - it' s a closed carbon cycle in the jargon. Some experts believe the technology shows promise.\" Team Fast has a very good project,\" says Professor Richard van de Sanden, head of the Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research.\" the project works on a very important issue: the storing of renewable energy in a transportable form and in a form which can actually be used.\" And several companies are supporting the project. \" What the 40' re working on together is a version of renewable energy that can combine renewable energy with CO2 capture,\" says Martijn de Graaff, senior business development manager at TNO Industry.\" If the 40 achieve a version of renewable energy that can combine renewable energy with CO2 capture a version of renewable energy that can combine renewable energy with CO2 capture will give the 40 a stable future.\" The students ' own commitment is impressive, with 15 of the 40 working full time on the project, and the rest contributing at least 20 - 25 hours per week.\" the 40 don' t get study points for it, but you can only learn so much at university about the practical experience of things,\" Mr van Cappellen says.\" It' s our own future the 40' re making.\"",

        "document": "The New York businessman - turned - politician said many controversial things and flip - flopped on a number of policy positions during the campaign. Here, we look back at 24 of The New York businessman - turned - politician professed beliefs. 1. The US should use waterboarding. waterboarding and other methods of\" strong interrogation\" should be deployed in the United States fight against the Islamic State group. These methods, Mr Trump said, are\" peanuts\" compared to the tactics used by the militants, such as beheadings.\" The New York businessman - turned - politician like waterboarding a lot. The New York businessman - turned - politician don' t think waterboarding' s tough enough,\" The New York businessman - turned - politician said in June of the banned practice. 2. Mexico should pay for the\" great, great wall\" Mr Trump has said The New York businessman - turned - politician wants to start building the much - touted wall on the shared border from the first day of The New York businessman - turned - politician presidency, and that Mexico will pay for the \" great , great wall \" Mr Trump has said he wants to start building the much - touted wall on the shared border. In some of The New York businessman - turned - politician earliest campaign comments, The New York businessman - turned - politician suggested that Mexicans coming to the US were criminals and\" rapists\". BBC analysis estimates the border wall could cost between $ 2. 2bn and $ 13bn. 3. Muslims should not be admitted to the US. In the wake of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, Mr Trump wrote that The New York businessman - turned - politician was\" calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country' s representatives can figure out what is going on\". The New York businessman - turned - politician' s since gone back on the announcement, instead saying that that The New York businessman - turned - politician would temporarily suspend\" immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism\". 4. Arab - Americans cheered the attacks on 9 / 11. Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that on 11 September 2001, there were thousands of Arab - Americans celebrating in New Jersey after two planes flew into the Twin Towers. The New York businessman - turned - politician says such public demonstrations\" tell you something\" about Muslims living in the US. However, there are no media reports to back up the claim. 5. Obamacare is a\" disaster\". Mr Trump says The New York businessman - turned - politician wants Congress to fully repeal the president' s Affordable Care Act, which aims at extending the number of Americans with health insurance, but The New York businessman - turned - politician believes that\" everybody' s got to be covered\". A spokesman for Mr Trump said The New York businessman - turned - politician would propose\" a health plan that will return authority to the states and operate under free market principles\". The increase in premiums revealed just before the election bolstered the Trump attacks. 6. Climate change is just\" weather\" While Mr Trump believes that maintaining\" clean air\" and\" clean water\" is important, Mr Trump has dismissed climate change science as a\" hoax\" and believes environmental restrictions on businesses make businesses less competitive in the global marketplace.\" Mr Trump do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country,\" Mr Trump told CNN on the issue.\" It costs so much and nobody knows exactly if It' s going to work.\" 7. The world would be better off if Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi were still in power. Mr Trump told CNN that Mr Trump believes the situation in both Libya and Iraq is\" far worse\" than the situation in both Libya and Iraq ever was under the leaders of the two countries. While Mr Trump concedes Saddam was a\" horrible guy\", Mr Trump says Saddam Hussein did a better job combating terrorists. 8. Illegal migrants should be deported. Trump once said that Mr Trump wanted to deport all of the approximately 11. 3 million undocumented immigrants in the US, despite criticism that this idea is both xenophobic, next to impossible and prohibitively expensive - the BBC estimates a cost of $ 114bn. Mr Trump official policy now says only those with criminal records will be deported immediately, although immigration controls will still be massively beefed up. Any undocumented migrants would also face the risk of deportation. 9. Syrian refugees could be a\" Trojan horse\" Mr Trump says that the Paris attacks prove that even a handful of terrorists posing as migrants could do catastrophic damage, and so Mr Trump will oppose resettling any Syrians in the US, and deport those who have already been resettled. It' s unclear if Mr Trump still believes that deportations are necessary, though Mr Trump has still vowed to suspend the intake of Syrian refugees. 10. Vladimir Putin is a\" leader\" Mr Trump has noted the Russian president' s\" great control over Vladimir Putin country\" and criticised the state of the relations between his country and the US. Mr Trump told CNN:\" Mr Trump would probably get along with Vladimir Putin very well. And Mr Trump don' t think you' d be having the kind of problems that you' re having right now\". More recently Mr Trump has said that Mr Putin doesn' t\" respect\" the US, although that was no reason to get tough on Vladimir Putin. 11. Taxes should be reduced for everyone. Trump wants to condense the current seven tax brackets to just three, with no income tax for\" low - income Americans\". Mr Trump would lower the business tax to 15 %, from 35 %. Mr Trump would also allow multinational companies keeping profits overseas to repatriate multinational companies keeping profits overseas cash at a 10 % tax rate. 12. Hedge fund managers are\" getting away with murder\" Mr Trump found common ground with Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren when Mr Trump ' s said that hedge fund managers and the ultra - wealthy did not pay enough taxes. However, after the campaign released specifics of Mr Trump ' s plan, analysts argued that hedge fund managers would actually get a tax cut along with the middle class. 13. China should be taken to task on a number of trade - related issues. Mr Trump ' s has said Mr Trump ' s will make China stop undervaluing China currency, and force China to step up China environmental and labour standards. Mr Trump ' s is also critical of the county' s lax attitude towards American intellectual property and hacking. 14. The Black Lives Matter movement is\" trouble\" Mr Trump mocked former Democratic candidates like Martin O ' Malley for apologising to members of the protest movement against police brutality and cast Mr Trump ' s as a pro - law enforcement candidate.\" Mr Trump ' s think The Black Lives Matter movement' re looking for trouble,\" Mr Trump ' s once said of the activist group. Mr Trump ' s also tweeted a controversial and widely debunked graphic purporting to show that African Americans kill white and black people at far higher rates than white people or police officers. 15. Mr Trump ' s' s worth $ 10bn. Based on Mr Trump' s 92 - page personal financial disclosure form, Bloomberg calculated last year that the real estate mogul was worth about $ 2. 9bn, while Forbes recently put Trump' s net worth at $ 3. 7bn. Mr Trump has however insisted that Mr Trump ' s is worth\" in excess\" of $ 10bn. 16. Veteran healthcare in the US needs a major overhaul. Mr Trump wants to clear out the executive level in the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying that waiting times for doctor visits have only increased after previous interventions failed. Thousands of veterans have died while waiting for care, Mr Trump ' s says. Mr Trump ' s will invest in the treatment of\" invisible wounds\" like post - traumatic stress disorder and depression. Mr Trump ' s would also increase the number of doctors who specialise in women' s health to help care for the increasing number of female veterans. 17. Lobbyists should be more restricted. Mr Trump proposes that there be a five - year ban that prevents government officials and members of congress from leaving and then immediately becoming lobbyists. Mr Trump ' s also calls for a lifetime ban on senior administration officials from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. 18. Mr Trump ' s is a\" really nice guy\" In Trump' s most recent book, Crippled America, Mr Trump ' s writes that\" Mr Trump ' s' m a really nice guy, believe Mr Trump ' s, Mr Trump ' s pride Mr Trump ' s on being a nice guy but Mr Trump ' s' m also passionate and determined to make our country great again\". The news site Gawker points out that Mr Trump calls Mr Trump a\" nice guy\" throughout the book, and Mr Trump repeated that self - assessment in Mr Trump opening monologue on Saturday Night Live and in an interview with the Washington Post. 19. Mr Trump could not have groped an unattractive woman. A video from 2005 showed Mr Trump making obscene comments about women and triggered numerous claims of alleged sexual harassment. At one rally, Mr Trump suggested that one of the accusers - a\" horrible woman\" - was not attractive enough for Mr Trump to have groped:\" Mr Trump don' t think so! Mr Trump don' t think so!\" 20. Tokyo and Seoul should build up nuclear arsenals. Mr Trump has said Japan and South Korea should not rely on the US so much and would benefit from having Japan and South Korea own weapons. Nuclear war between Japan and North Korea may be\" terrible\" but Nuclear war between Japan and North Korea would be\" pretty quick\". 21. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( Nato) is a\" rip - off\" Why? Because the US pays more than anyone else. But Mr Trump later said Mr Trump was\" all\" in favour of the alliance. 22. Doctors should be punished for administering abortions. Or should Doctors? In an interview with MSNBC, Mr Trump said that if abortion were to become illegal, women should be punished for obtaining abortion. Mr Trump then retracted, saying the doctor would be responsible and he or she should be punished, instead. 23. The Republican National Committee' s rules were\" stacked against Mr Trump\" Mr Trump called the delegate system\" crooked\" and\" unfair\". Mr Trump repeatedly clashed with the RNC over The Republican National Committee ' s nomination process and how The Republican National Committee ' s treated Mr Trump candidacy during the primaries. Mr Trump called rules that allowed Senator Ted Cruz to gain more delegates than Mr Trump in some states\" rigged\", as Mr Trump did later when talking about the electoral process when polls were showing Hillary Clinton ahead of Mr Trump. 24. The federal minimum wage should be raised. Workers should be paid more than the current level of $ 7. 25 / hour, Mr Trump has said. though this is another issue Mr Trump has flip - flopped on repeatedly.

So, before we get all Doctor Who, let' s take a look at some top facts about the exciting moon for ET - spotters... Enceladus is the sixth largest moon of Saturn. Saturn ' s ice - crusted moon Enceladus is about 500 kilometres ( 310 miles) in diameter, making Saturn ' s ice - crusted moon Enceladus pretty small. In comparison, the Earth is over 12, 000 kilometres in diameter. Saturn has many different types of moons, some are very small, and one - Titan - is very, very large! Altogether, Saturn has 62 confirmed moons, 53 of which have names, and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometres. Enceladus is named after a giant from Greek mythology. The name was decided by the son of the man who first discovered Saturn ' s ice - crusted moon Enceladus, astronomer Frederick William Herschel. the man who first discovered it , astronomer Frederick William Herschel spotted Enceladus all the way back in 1789, during the first use of the man who first discovered it , astronomer Frederick William Herschel new telescope, which was the largest in the world at the time. Enceladus is covered in a thick surface of ice. But it' s what lies deep below this icy surface that has got scientists really excited! It' s thought a warm ocean flows below the surface, where the conditions to support life could exist. Jets of water vapour and ice particles erupt from Enceladus ' underground ocean through deep icy crevasses called tiger stripes near the moon' s south pole. These plumes have provided clues about the planets inner - workings. The Cassini spacecraft conducted a fly - through of the plumes, helping to provide the data that has led scientists to believe the planet could hold life.",

The government brought in the requirement in the wake of the Trojan Horse allegations, which suggested there had been attempts by groups of hardline Muslims to take over schools in Birmingham. Earlier this month a committee of MPs said that apart from one incident in one school\" no evidence of extremism or radicalisation was found by any of the inquiries in any of the schools involved\".

Mr Bevan , head of Southend High School for Boys said schools and colleges had, for a long time, been required to deliver a broad and balanced curriculum addressing issues of behaviour and conduct and placing a broad and balanced curriculum addressing issues of behaviour and conduct within a developmental framework of spiritual, moral and cultural understanding.\" These provisions have existed without controversy for many years and are ample and effective.\" Mr Bevan , head of Southend High School for Boys accused the rules on British values as\" deeply ill - considered\" and\" political posturing\".\" In what way do fundamental British values differ, for example, from French or Swedish ones?\" these values change over time, with women now\" allowed\" the vote, said Mr Bevan.\" If these fundamental British values change over time, we can hardly describe these values as fundamental.\" But, Mr Bevan , head of Southend High School for Boys argued, the problem was not just one of definition.\" Just take one moment to imagine how fundamental British values might be interpreted by a future right - wing government, or a partner in that government.\" Mr Bevan , head of Southend High School for Boys said Mr Bevan , head of Southend High School for Boys was particularly concerned that Ofsted was being asked to gauge the views of students in order to assess how how well schools actively promote these values.

A shortlist of 10 birds has been chosen by online voters on Mr Lindo , who is backing the blackbird campaign' s website from an original list of 60. Mr Lindo will close the vote on the day of the general election, 7 May, and ask the new government to officially appoint the winner as national bird. The RSPB welcomed the initiative and said the lack of a national bird for Britain was a\" glaring omission\". Mr Lindo, the self - styled\" Urban Birder\", told BBC Radio 4' s Today programme:\" Mr Lindo , who is backing the blackbird want to encourage the great British public to vote for the bird that best represents all that is great about this nation.\" Mr Lindo , who is backing the blackbird hoped the appointment could be\" the first act\" of a new government, once the dust has settled from\" the other election\", Mr Lindo , who is backing the blackbird told the programme. The robin has emerged as an early favourite, but Mr Lindo, who is backing the blackbird, told Today:\" People consider the robin as a British bird - but [ like] a lot of our native birds... some of the population move south to Iberia for the winter and are replaced by immigrants from the continent.\" So the robin you see in your back garden during winter is not necessarily British born.\" And Mr Lindo , who is backing the blackbird added:\" the robin is quite a violent bird.\" A first round of polling on the campaign' s website received 70, 000 votes. One of England' s rarest birds, the hen harrier, is something of a surprise contender, according to Mr Lindo.\" Mr Lindo , who is backing the blackbird was expecting 10 garden birds in the list,\" Mr Lindo , who is backing the blackbird said, adding that the original pool of 60 candidates included favourites from literature and song such as the turtledove, nightingale and skylark - all of which have dropped out of contention. The hen harrier, which was the subject of a recent campaign because One of England ' s rarest birds , the hen harrier had been the target of illegal hunting, was down to just one breeding pair a couple of years ago and\" may already be extinct\", Mr Lindo , who is backing the blackbird said. The robin is sometimes mistakenly thought of as the nation' s official bird, the RSPB said, after the robin was given the title unofficially by some enthusiasts in the 1960s. Northern Ireland does not have an official national bird, while the golden eagle and red kite are sometimes regarded as unofficial national symbols of Scotland and Wales respectively. In December 2013 a petition was lodged by the RSPB for the golden eagle to be recognised as Scotland' s official national symbol, but the Scottish parliament voted against the plans after the Scottish parliament decided the RSPB needed to do more to show greater support for the proposals. The RSPB said the RSPB welcomed Mr Lindo' s initiative in getting people to discuss people favourite birds. And the RSPB said the fact Britain did not already have an official national bird while other countries did was a\" glaring omission\". Grahame Madge, spokesman for the RSPB, said:\" It' s opened people' s eyes to birds, which is raising awareness. As an organisation the RSPB are really behind Mr Lindo ' s.\" It seems most other nations have pipped the UK to the post in identifying a national bird, and for the UK not to have a national bird when the UK are a nation of bird lovers does seem to be a glaring omission.\" The shortlist, in pictures:. 1.

The final report was drafted by Home Office officials but some members of the panel, which included three people who also sit on the ACMD, insisted on writing in what became known as the\" safety - valve\" clause. The recommendation for\" general prohibition\" was amended to say that there should be exemptions for substances\" where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed\". The line was included specifically to ensure that some low risk products could be excluded from the ban.

Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £ 4. 6bn since 2010 - a 31 % overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £ 500m in cash terms this year, The survey , which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England said.\" Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, reduce means that an additional £ 1. 1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,\" the report warned. The survey , which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, The survey , which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England said.\" What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,\" ADASS president Ray James said.\" In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing.\" ADASS called for the government to\" protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community\".

The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over - 65s. The\" care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people' s own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit Users postcode and find out how much each service costs where Users live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said:\" Increasing budgets isn' t the only solution.

        "document": "The materials, which can sense pressure as sensitively and quickly as human skin, have been outlined by two groups reporting in Nature Materials. The skins are arrays of small pressure sensors that convert tiny changes in pressure into electrical signals. The arrays are built into or under flexible rubber sheets that could be stretched into a variety of shapes. The materials could be used to sheath artificial limbs or to create robots that can pick up and hold fragile objects. their skins could also be used to improve tools for minimally - invasive surgery. In one approach, Ali Javey at the University of California, Berkeley, and Javey ' s colleagues built up layers of criss - crossed nanometre - scale wires topped with a thin rubber sheet. Together, the stack acts as what is known as a thin - film transistor, or TFT, with a pressure - sensitive layer on top. The amount of electrical current running through the device is dependent upon how much pressure is exerted on the rubber sheet; more pressure allows more current to flow. The team demonstrated the flexibility of Ali Javey at the University of California , Berkeley , and his colleagues TFT stacks by bending their TFT stacks to a radius smaller than that of a pencil without changing the skin' s performance.\" Javey' s work is a nice demonstration of Ali Javey at the University of California , Berkeley , and his colleagues capability in making a large array of nanowire TFTs,\" said Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, whose group demonstrated the second approach. The heart of Professor Bao' s devices is micro - structured rubber sheet in the middle of the TFT - effectively re - creating the functionality of the Berkeley group' s skins with less layers.\" Instead of laminating a pressure - sensitive resistor array on top of a nanowire TFT array, the Stanford group ' s made our transistors to be pressure sensitive,\" Professor Bao explained to BBC News.\" Our microstructured rubber can bounce back to Our microstructured rubber original shape much faster and enable higher sensitivity,\" Zhenan Bao of Stanford University , whose group demonstrated the second approach added. The overall flexibility of the Stanford group' s skins appears to be lower, and Professor Bao concedes that to develop Zhenan Bao of Stanford University , whose group demonstrated the second approach group' s approach further, better conductive rubber will be needed. Nevertheless, both groups demonstrate that two groups reporting in Nature Materials skins can register a pressure in a tenth of a second, over a large range - from five grams per square centimetre to 40 times that high. Those numbers rival the response of human skin, made with relatively inexpensive manufacturing techniques. John Boland, a nanotechnologist from Trinity College Dublin, praised the two approaches in a critique for Nature Materials.\" Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of these studies is how these studies elegantly demonstrate that it is possible to exploit well - established processing technologies to engineer low - cost innovative solutions to important technical problems,\" John Boland , a nanotechnologist from Trinity College Dublin wrote. However, he notes that there are still\" significant opportunities for further innovation\", such as reducing the distance between the sensors in the arrays to maximise the detail the sensors in the arrays could\" feel\", as well as improvements that could make large - area arrays possible and affordable.",

        "document": "Warning: Readers may find some of the details of violence in this piece distressing. It was late October 2014, and on paper the young banker had lived what could only be described as a privileged and successful life. But over the space of a few drug - and alcohol - fuelled days, the young banker tortured and killed Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, before calling the police to let the police know what the young banker had done. In court, lawyers described a much darker side to the young banker apparently gilded existence, one involving drugs, sexual sadism, and an extreme personality disorder. Jutting had tortured Ms Ningsih for three days, before the young banker killed Sumarti Ningsih , 23 by slashing Sumarti Ningsih , 23 throat over a prolonged period, nearly decapitating Sumarti Ningsih , 23. the young banker then hid Sumarti Ningsih , 23 body in a suitcase. A few days later, Jutting brought the young banker second victim, Ms Mujiasih, to the young banker flat. his second victim , Ms Mujiasih was a woman the young banker would go on to describe simply as\" the prey\" the young banker had been hunting.\" Sumarti was generous. was is clear from the evidence in the house. Sumarti Ningsih , 23 driving force was to improve life for Sumarti Ningsih , 23 family, to make her family richer. Life may be peaceful in the village but Sumarti Ningsih , 23 would have been all too aware of the possibilities of a life with more material comforts.\" The story of Sumarti: Born in Indonesia, murdered in Hong Kong. Experts for the defence say Jutting' s IQ score is 137 - putting the young banker in the top 1 % of the population. But Experts for the defence also diagnosed the young banker with four disorders, which Experts for the defence said combined to lead to the killings:. • Narcissistic personality disorder. • Sexual sadism disorder. • Cocaine use disorder. • Alcohol use disorder. Prosecution witnesses argued that such conditions should not\" substantially\" diminish the young banker ability to control the young banker actions. But according to the defence, when it came to the young banker narcissism, the signs were there from an early age. Jutting was born in London in 1985. the young banker first name Rurik was chosen by the young banker mother, and literally translated as\" great one\" - it was an imperial dynasty in Russia. the young banker described the young banker as an ambitious boy who had a happy childhood. But even from a young age, Jutting displayed feelings of superiority and entitlement, the young banker defence argued. the young banker was admitted to the prestigious private school Winchester College in the young banker early teens but was disappointed that the young banker ranked sixth in the scholarship selection, rather than first. When the young banker mother expressed delight at the young banker entrance exam results, Jutting commented that the young banker found his mother reaction\" almost insulting\", because her reaction implied that his mother was surprised the young banker had got in. There were other troubling episodes. When Mr Jutting was 16, Mr Jutting father tried to take his father own life by slashing his father wrists while his father was in the house. Jutting had to help provide the initial care and go to hospital with his father. Jutting also said Mr Jutting had been sexually assaulted by another student while studying at Winchester. In 2003, Mr Jutting was seen by a psychiatrist, who said Mr Jutting experienced suicidal thoughts and that Mr Jutting was affected by knowledge of Mr Jutting parents ' marital problems and concerns about Mr Jutting mother' s health. Nonetheless, Jutting excelled academically, being admitted to Cambridge University to study history and law at Peterhouse college. A fellow of the college, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC Mr Jutting was ambitious, a keen athlete, committed to Mr Jutting studies and from a stable Catholic background. British banker guilty of murders. Killed by Jutting and forgotten by Indonesia. ' We were lucky it wasn' t We ' ( video) Jutting gained first class honours in Mr Jutting history degree but was disappointed to receive a 2: 1 in law, and challenged the examiner' s approach. The inability to accept criticism, psychiatrists said, was another sign of Mr Jutting narcissistic personality traits. On graduation, Jutting worked at Barclays bank, before being head - hunted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mr Jutting role involved developing complex tax products and, within a few years, Mr Jutting salary had risen to £ 270, 000 ( $ 334, 705) per year. But then, things began to go wrong. In 2012, while trying to market a tax product in Luxembourg, auditors began investigating Mr Jutting team for possible violation of regulations, flagging up Jutting in particular as a serious risk to the organisation. Jutting described this as a\" negative turning point\" in Mr Jutting career and felt Mr Jutting move to Hong Kong the subsequent year had been arranged by bosses to get Mr Jutting out of the way. At one point, Mr Jutting manager told Jutting Mr Jutting was one of the most unpredictable people his manager had ever worked with. Jutting' s alcohol use was also uncontrollable around this time, as Mr Jutting needed to drink excessive amounts in order to get to sleep. Mr Jutting then - girlfriend was so worried about Mr Jutting reliance on alcohol His then - girlfriend banned Mr Jutting from drinking at home. Mr Jutting briefly saw a psychiatrist at this point, and said Mr Jutting often felt down and tearful at work. By the time Mr Jutting had moved to Hong Kong in October 2013, Mr Jutting was consuming three quarters of a bottle of vodka to sleep and using cocaine. Mr Jutting said Mr Jutting smuggled cocaine up Mr Jutting rectum on Mr Jutting flight to Hong Kong. Once in Hong Kong, Jutting rented a flat in The J Residence, a luxury development in Wanchai popular with expatriate workers. Although located in a busy street in the heart of the city, the development gives off a sense of exclusivity. Keycards are needed to access individual floors, while the sheer height of the building, at over 41 floors, means that residents can enjoy views of Hong Kong' s skyline - from the bar, garden, and even swimming pool on the roof. But Jutting described Jutting as feeling increasingly despondent and nihilistic in the city. Jutting did not have much of a social life and spent long periods drinking at home while playing computer games. Jutting also had extreme sexual interests, and an obsession with sadistic pornography, experts said. Jutting began using sex workers in 2009 and as time went on Jutting behaviour became increasingly forceful. On a number of occasions, Jutting removed condoms during sex without their consent, despite knowing removed would constitute rape in the UK. Jutting continued to fantasise about rape and kidnap even while Jutting was remanded in a psychiatric centre after Jutting arrest, prosecution expert Dr Kavin Chow said. By 2014, Jutting was\" spiralling out of control\". Jutting would go on cocaine binges that lasted for days. At one point, Jutting missed a scheduled meeting in London and, as an excuse, Jutting told Jutting boss Jutting had HIV. Jutting developed a round - the - clock craving for the drug, Jutting weight ballooned and in the weeks before the killings took place Jutting stopped going to work. Instead, Jutting spent hours watching and reading violent pornography. Jutting attempted to find men on Grindr to have sex with, later telling a psychologist Jutting had been\" trying to do everything Jutting could to get new experiences\", but described everything as\" disappointing\". On 25 October 2014 Jutting took Ms Ningsih to Jutting flat, after offering to pay Ms Ningsih for sex. They had had sex on one occasion before, in a hotel, but things had got so violent that Ms Ningsih asked to end the session early, and refunded half Jutting money. On this second occasion, the sex also switched from consensual to non - consensual, as Jutting began to beat Ms Ningsih. Jutting then held Ms Ningsih captive, and tortured Ms Ningsih using pliers, Jutting belt, sex toys and Jutting hands. Jutting filmed some of the torture on Jutting phone, in footage that was shown to the jury. The details that follow are distressing and brutal. Jutting claims Jutting drifted in and out of the influence of cocaine:\" When Jutting became relatively less under the influence of cocaine Jutting became quite apologetic - Jutting told Ms Ningsih repeatedly Jutting loved Ms Ningsih,\" Jutting said in one police interview. Yet, in another interview, Jutting said that Jutting hadn' t tortured Ms Ningsih as much as Jutting would have liked, before killing Ms Ningsih. Jutting killed Ms Ningsih on the third day, after Jutting made Ms Ningsih kneel in front of the toilet bowl, with Ms Ningsih hands tied behind Ms Ningsih back, and lick the bowl. Jutting then cut Ms Ningsih throat with a knife but Ms Ningsih did not die immediately, so Jutting dragged Ms Ningsih into the shower and continued. Jutting recorded several videos describing the aftermath of the killing on Jutting phone. Eventually, Jutting wrapped up the body and placed the body into a suitcase, which Jutting left on the balcony. Jutting began planning to torture a second victim on 31 October. Jutting bought tools, including sandpaper, nails and a blow torch, filming tools , including sandpaper , nails and a blow torch on Jutting iPhone, describing how Jutting might use tools , including sandpaper , nails and a blow torch to torture a victim. That night, Jutting went out and met Ms Mujiasih, inviting Ms Mujiasih back to Jutting flat for sex. They began kissing and cuddling on the sofa but Ms Mujiasih began shouting when Ms Mujiasih saw a gag by the sofa. Jutting held a knife against Ms Mujiasih throat, telling Ms Mujiasih Jutting would kill Ms Mujiasih if Ms Mujiasih continued to struggle. Ms Mujiasih continued struggling, and Jutting killed Ms Mujiasih by slashing at Ms Mujiasih neck. Jutting later told police:\" Ms Mujiasih was simply, the word Jutting' d use is prey. Jutting was hunting for prey and Ms Mujiasih was unfortunately the person who was hunted\". After taking more cocaine, Jutting says Jutting contemplated taking Jutting own life. Jutting eventually called 999. Jutting also called Jutting boss, saying:\" Jutting' m in a lot of trouble, his boss need to do something about the reputation of the bank.\" Even though Jutting had not been to work in the two weeks leading up to the killings, the office was still on Jutting mind. After Jutting killed Ms Ningsih, Jutting changed the out - of - office message from Jutting work email to:\" Jutting am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody. [ Last line only really worked if Jutting had followed through..]\" On one occasion, according to an expert witness, Jutting likened Jutting life to The Truman Show, a movie starring Jim Carrey about a man who' s entire life, unbeknownst to a man who ' s entire life , unbeknownst to him , is a TV show, is a TV show. likened too may reflect Jutting narcissism because Jutting wanted to believe that\" Jutting life was so significant that … millions of people would be interested in watching his life\".

Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses ( FSB), said the warning from Natwest and RBS\" will be deeply concerning to small firms\". The FSB also urged the Bank of England to consider the impact on smaller firms of cutting interest rates. Mike Amey, a managing director at investment firm Pimco, said the two banks were\" giving Natwest and RBS wiggle room in the very unlikely event\" that the Bank turns the official interest rate negative.\" The Bank of England sets the interest rate next week, so the fact the Bank of England put this out this week... is possibly a bit of a reminder to the Bank of England there are negative consequences,\" Mike Amey , a managing director at investment firm Pimco told the BBC. UK interest rates have been unchanged since the Bank of England cut UK interest rates to a record low of 0. 5 % in March 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. The Bank kept UK interest rates on hold earlier this month, despite speculation the Bank of England would cut rates further. But Bank governor Mark Carney has said it is likely\" some monetary policy easing\" will be required to boost the UK economy in response to the Brexit vote. However, Bank governor Mark Carney has said Bank governor Mark Carney does not favour rates falling any lower than 0. 25 %. Nevertheless, some economists believe that rates could still be cut to zero or lower later this year. When the rate goes below zero, the normal relationship between banks and customers is reversed. Instead of the lender getting paid interest by the bank for allowing the bank to use the lender money, the lender has to pay the bank for holding the lender money. The underlying idea is much the same as cutting interest rates in more normal times. The aim is to encourage more borrowing and spending by firms and less saving. In 2014, the European Central Bank was the first major central bank to introduce negative interest rates, with the aim of encouraging banks to lend to businesses rather than hold on to money.",

        "document": "NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh says NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh worries the stoppages will put vulnerable people\" at risk\", while chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies says the stoppages will\" inevitably lead to patients suffering\" and Health Minister Ben Gummer claims patients will be put in\" harm' s way\". It' s easy to understand why. On 26 and 27 April junior doctors will stop providing emergency cover - unlike in the previous strikes in the contract dispute. It means as well as downing tools for medics routine duties, medics will walk out of A & E units and intensive care departments, leaving some of the sickest and most vulnerable patients in the hands of others. But will the reality of the all - out strike be really as bad as the rhetoric? After all, the doctors ' code of conduct produced by the General Medical Council decrees they must not harm patients or put patients at risk. And the British Medical Association is adamant the stoppages do not breach this code because of the contingency plans being put in place. The union is legally bound to give the NHS seven days ' notice of industrial action. In this case the health service has had five weeks. The time has allowed hospital bosses to carefully consider what hospital bosses need and put plans in place. put has been done in partnership with BMA reps, while at a national level Department of Health and NHS England officials have been meeting regularly to ensure the contingency arrangements are satisfactory. And as yet no hospital has yet said it cannot cope. said is because large chunks of the routine work has been postponed and staff will be redeployed into emergency areas. There will be consultants, staff doctors - those who are not in training but have not yet reached consultant level - nurses, midwives and health care assistants in work. GPs are also being asked to keep a greater number of appointments free for urgent on - the - day cases than normal, while patients will be warned in the lead - up to the strike to think carefully about how patients use the health service during the stoppages. The result is that there are plenty of people who think the system will run pretty smoothly. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Royal College of Emergency Medicine have both released statements saying The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Royal College of Emergency Medicine are satisfied with the arrangements being put in place. In fact, you could argue the result in some departments may be that the system may actually work better than on a normal day. Take A & E, for example. Having more consultants on the floor could actually speed up the flow of patients as more consultants will be able to make quick decisions about the care patients need. Although there is an argument the smaller hospitals with fewer consultants may find it more difficult. Meanwhile, in emergency surgery and intensive care the presence of consultants should, in theory, more than make up for the absence of the juniors. Also, it should be remembered that the stoppages are from 08: 00 to 17: 00 BST - not for 24 or 48 hours as the previous strikes have been - so there will be some respite during the two days. Instead, the problems might be more run of the mill. Junior doctors play a vital role chasing up test results, ordering x - rays, taking bloods, ordering prescriptions and preparing patients for discharge. Consultants may not have the time to do some of these, Consultants skills may be a little rusty or Consultants may simply not know Consultants way round the system to get on top of the jobs. Senior nurses will be able to take some of the strain, but there is bound to be disruption. However, that doesn' t mean the concerns being voiced are not justified. Talking to those who work in the service, there does seem to be a weak spot. a weak spot concerns what happens if there is an unexpected emergency on a general or surgical ward or perhaps in a psychiatric unit. When a patient collapses, a junior doctor would normally be one of the first on the scene. If a junior doctor aren' t there and a patient dies, questions will be naturally asked. And this, perhaps, is the crux of the matter. this was a point made by Prof Lord Darzi of Denham, a surgeon and former health minister, in an article in the Daily Telegraph.. Prof Lord Darzi of Denham , a surgeon and former health minister wrote that every family afflicted with heartbreak on the strike days\" would always wonder\" whether loved ones would have lived if junior doctors had been there. Trust between doctors and society might be\" irreparably damaged\", Prof Lord Darzi of Denham , a surgeon and former health minister warned.

The Nobel committee praised President Juan Manuel Santos for a peace deal signed with Farc rebels, but rejected by Colombians in a vote. Mr Santos said President Juan Manuel Santos dedicated the award to\" all the victims of the conflict\", and the Farc leader congratulated President Juan Manuel Santos. About 260, 000 people have been killed and more than six million internally displaced in Colombia. The award did not include Farc leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, who also signed the accord. The head of the Nobel commitee said the award recognised the president' s\" resolute efforts\" to end the conflict.\" The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the parties who have contributed to the peace process,\" Kaci Kullman Five added. Sources: BBC Monitoring, Colombian presidency. Mr Santos said on Twitter:\" This honourable distinction is not for President Juan Manuel Santos, the award' s for all the victims of the conflict. Together we' ll win the most important award of them all: peace.\" The peace deal was rejected by 50. 2 % of voters who went to the polls on 2 October. The committee acknowledged the result, saying:\" What the ' No ' side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement.\" the Nobel commitee also said that finding a balance between the need for reconciliation and ensuring justice for the victims would be a difficult challenge. Also on Twitter, Farc leader Timochenko said:\" Farc leader Rodrigo Londono , known as Timochenko , who also signed the accord congratulate President Juan Manuel Santos, Cuba and Norway, who sponsored the process, and Venezuela and Chile, who assisted the process, without President Juan Manuel Santos , Cuba and Norway , who sponsored the process , and Venezuela and Chile , who assisted it, peace would be impossible.\" Earlier, Farc leader Rodrigo Londono , known as Timochenko , who also signed the accord had written:\" The only prize we aspire to is peace with social justice for Colombia, without ( right - wing) paramilitary groups, without retaliation or lies. Peace in the streets.\" the award was a Peace Prize for a peace deal that wasn' t. President Santos joins a long line of Nobel Peace Prize winners who have been rewarded for effort as much as achievement. But it is too easy to be cynical. The Nobel Peace Prize has often been controversial. In recent years a variety of international bureaucracies have won - the EU, the IAEA and the OPCW. Why, some have argued, should people get a prize for simply doing people job? What, others ask, had US President Barack Obama actually done to merit the prize in 2009, other than be elected? But the Nobel has often gone to extraordinary individuals who really have gone above and beyond to bring peace - in Northern Ireland and East Timor to name just two examples. Maybe the award to President Santos may yet galvanise public opinion in Colombia to think again about the deal. Critics, led by former president Alvaro Uribe, said the deal was too lenient to the rebels. Under the agreement, special courts would have been created to try crimes committed during the conflict. Those who confessed would have received lighter sentences and avoided serving any time in conventional prisons. The Farc would also have been guaranteed 10 seats in the Colombian Congress in the 2018 and 2022 elections. Despite the rejection by voters, Mr Santos vowed to continue with talks with the rebels. Government negotiators have already returned to the Cuban capital Havana for further discussions with Farc leaders. Kaci Kullman Five, from the Nobel committee, said the award was also meant as\" encouragement\" to the rebels.\" Giving the prize to Santos is not a belittlement to any of the other parties.\" The Farc is obviously a very important part of this process. ' ' 1964: Set up as armed wing of Communist Party. 2002: At The Farc height, The Farc had an army of 20, 000 fighters controlling up to a third of the country. Senator Ingrid Betancourt was kidnapped and held for six years along with 14 other hostages. 2008: The Farc suffers a series of defeats in The Farc worst year. 2012: Start of peace talks in Havana. 2016: Definitive ceasefire.

        "document": "Giving people the right to buy people council houses and shares in previously nationalised firms such as British Telecom and British Gas were among the initiatives that won Mrs Thatcher much support. But some believe that other changes, such as those that made mortgages and credit much easier to get, sowed the seeds of future crises that still affect many to this day. Here, BBC reporters look at some of the changes that, for better or worse, have changed our finances forever. By Brian Milligan, personal finance reporter, BBC News. The Right to Buy Scheme for council houses was one of Margaret Thatcher' s most popular policies. The Right to Buy Scheme for council houses was enshrined in the Housing Act of 1980, making The Right to Buy Scheme for council houses one of Mrs Thatcher first major pieces of legislation after Mrs Thatcher came to office in 1979. The number of people who bought people who bought their council house from their local authorities council house from people who bought their council house from their local authorities local authorities rose to 200, 000 by 1982, and again peaked at 180, 000 in 1989, Mrs Thatcher last full year as prime minister. Since the Housing Act came into force, it is estimated that some two million homes have been sold to former council tenants. The sale price was based on market valuation, but included substantial discounts, depending on how long a tenant had been living there. When Labour came to power in 1997, Labour reduced the value of such discounts in areas where councils were running short of housing stock. Critics said the policy resulted in speculators buying up valuable housing stock too cheaply. The Right to Buy Scheme was extended in the March 2013 Budget, as the government vowed to increase sales once again. By Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent, BBC News. Before Mrs Thatcher arrived at No 10, British passports contained a special page to record the amount of cash travellers took out of the country. The page was one of the first things to be scrapped by the new government, as the Tories moved to abolish exchange controls. The Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, raised travel allowances to £ 1, 000 per trip and permitted overseas property purchases of up to £ 100, 000. On the tax front, the basic rate was cut by 3p to 30p in the pound, while the highest rate came down from 83p to 60p. But Thatcher' s chancellors not only cut income tax, but also changed the way we pay tax. To fund lower taxes on incomes, up went tax on most things shoppers bought. VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8 % to 15 %. Within a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25 %, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40 %. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor. With money from tax cuts in shoppers pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the\" feelgood factor\". shoppers were encouraged further as credit was unleashed. Restrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s. And, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two - and - a - half times salary was thrown out of the window. Building societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete. The Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years. Mrs Thatcher wanted self - reliance, not reliance on the state. wanted was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988. The new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, personal pensions backfired. The promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions. Compensating the victims cost the pensions industry £ 11bn. More successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to £ 6, 000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break. To complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax - free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa. The idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have £ 390bn salted away. By John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News. Few senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that Mrs Thatcher reforms had on the power of the movement. Mrs Thatcher was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike. The Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job. Secret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day. In 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million. The miners ' strike of 1984 - 85 came to symbolise the government' s battle with the unions. The year - long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police. In the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever. Unions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish Unions power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress - affiliated unions. One of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged. By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News. A policy of privatising the UK' s large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such A policy of privatising the UK ' s large utilities was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had the initiatives critics. The recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership. By the end of the Tories first term, the Tories had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable & Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later. privatised led to a new wave of first - time shareholders in the UK. One of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell - off of shares in British Gas in 1986. The promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to\" tell Sid\" about the chance to buy shares at\" affordable\" prices. Anyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid. Privatisation was key to the Thatcher government' s economic policy. As a result, the Thatcher government ' s hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing. the Thatcher government ' s also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies. Yet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s. In 1981, 28 % was owned by UK individuals. 28 % had fallen to 20 % by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet 28 % fell to just over 11 % by the end of 2010. By Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News. The impact of one of Margaret Thatcher' s deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK. The so - called\" Big Bang\", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange. The most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face - to - face. Big Bang moved traders at a stroke from that to screen - based and telephone trading. The so - called \" Big Bang \" , introduced on 27 October 1986 also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen' s club, ruled by restrictive practices. ( It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.) Before Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor. Price competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm. At best this club was a self - regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at this club worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping. Big Bang saw many of the City' s historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one - stop shops. jostled, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses. Big Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share - buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into people banks and order a parcel of shares. But while The so - called \" Big Bang \" , introduced on 27 October 1986 made dealing and investing easier, The so - called \" Big Bang \" , introduced on 27 October 1986 also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.",

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Scientists have found that two types of chemicals called neonicotinoids and coumaphos are interfering with the insect' s ability to learn and remember. Experiments revealed that exposure was also lowering brain activity, especially when the two pesticides were used in combination. The research is detailed in two papers in Nature Communications and the Journal of Experimental Biology. But a company that makes the substances said laboratory - based studies did not always apply to bees in the wild. And another report, published by the Defra' s Food and Environment Research Agency ( Fera), concluded that there was no link between bee health and exposure to neonicotinoids. The government agency carried out a study looking at bumblebees living on the edges of fields treated with the chemicals. Falling numbers. Honey bees around the world are facing an uncertain future. Honey bees around the world have been hit with a host of diseases, losses of habitat, and in the US the mysterious Colony Collapse Disorder has caused numbers to plummet. Now researchers are asking whether pesticides are also playing a role in Honey bees around the world decline. To investigate, scientists looked at two common pesticides: neonicotinoids, which are used to control pests on oil seed rape and other crops, and a group of organophosphate chemicals called coumaphos, which are used to kill the Varroa mite, a parasite that attacks the honey bee. Neonicotinoids are used more commonly in Europe, while coumaphos are more often employed in the United States. Work carried out by the University of Dundee, in Scotland, revealed that if the pesticides were applied directly to the brains of the pollinators, two common pesticides : neonicotinoids , which are used to control pests on oil seed rape and other crops , and a group of organophosphate chemicals called coumaphos , which are used to kill the Varroa mite , a parasite that attacks the honey bee caused a loss of brain activity. Dr Christopher Connolly said:\" We found neonicotinoids cause an immediate hyper - activation - so an epileptic type activity - an immediate hyper - activation - so an epileptic type activity was proceeded by neuronal inactivation, where the brain goes quiet and cannot communicate any more. The same effects occur when We used organophosphates.\" And if We used two common pesticides : neonicotinoids , which are used to control pests on oil seed rape and other crops , and a group of organophosphate chemicals called coumaphos , which are used to kill the Varroa mite , a parasite that attacks the honey bee together, the effect was additive, so two common pesticides : neonicotinoids , which are used to control pests on oil seed rape and other crops , and a group of organophosphate chemicals called coumaphos , which are used to kill the Varroa mite , a parasite that attacks the honey bee added to the toxicity: the effect was greater when two common pesticides : neonicotinoids , which are used to control pests on oil seed rape and other crops , and a group of organophosphate chemicals called coumaphos , which are used to kill the Varroa mite , a parasite that attacks the honey bee were present.\" Another series of laboratory - based experiments, carried out at Newcastle University, examined the behaviour of the bees. The researchers there found that bees exposed to both pesticides were unable to learn and then remember floral smells associated with a sweet nectar reward - a skill that is essential for bees in search of food. Dr Sally Williamson said:\" It would imply that the bees are able to forage less effectively, the bees are less able to find and learn and remember and then communicate to the bees hive mates what the good sources of pollen and nectar are.\" ' No threat ' She said that companies that are manufacturing the pesticides should take these findings into account when considering the safety of the chemicals. She explained:\" At the moment, the initial tests for bee toxicity are giving the bees an acute dose and then watching the bees to see if the bees die.\" But because bees do these complex learning tasks, bees are very social animals and bees have a complex behavioural repertoire, bees don' t need to be killed outright in order not to be affected.\" The European Commission recently called for a temporary moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids after a report by the European Food Safety Authority concluded that neonicotinoids posed a high acute risk to pollinators. But 14 out of the 27 EU nations - including the UK and Germany - opposed the ban, and the proposal has now been delayed. Ian Boyd, chief scientist at Defra, said:\" Decisions on the use of neonicotinoids must be based on sound scientific evidence.\" Ian Boyd , chief scientist at Defra said that the results of the Fera bumblebee study suggested that the extent of the impact might not be as high as some studies had suggested - and called for\" further data based on more realistic field trials is required\". Dr Julian Little, communications and government affairs manager at Bayer Crop Science Limited, which makes some of the pesticides, said the findings of laboratory - based studies should not be automatically extrapolated to the field.\" If you take an insecticide and you give an insecticide directly to an insect, Dr Julian Little , communications and government affairs manager at Bayer Crop Science Limited , which makes some of the pesticides can guarantee that you will have an effect - Dr Julian Little , communications and government affairs manager at Bayer Crop Science Limited , which makes some of the pesticides am not at all surprised that an effect is what you will see,\" Dr Julian Little , communications and government affairs manager at Bayer Crop Science Limited , which makes some of the pesticides explained.\" What is really important is seeing what happens in real situations - in real fields, in real bee colonies, in real bee hives, with real bee keepers.\"",

Every part of Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side team did Every part of their team bit but the biggest reason for Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side success is one man, Jose Mourinho. one man , Jose Mourinho influence was huge. Media playback is not supported on this device. The Blues manager is a serial winner who lives for titles and trophies - and one man , Jose Mourinho knows exactly how to get what one man , Jose Mourinho wants. MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer don' t accept the ' boring boring Chelsea ' jibes one man , Jose Mourinho side have faced recently. MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer think the ' boring boring Chelsea ' jibes his side have faced recently is utter rubbish. It is not Chelsea' s problem if teams cannot beat Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side, and it is pretty embarrassing if teams then call Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side boring. The only tag the Blues deserve is ' worthy champions ' because worthy champions is what Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side are. Everyone else has a lot of catching up to do. One of the biggest reasons Chelsea won the title is that, unlike one man , Jose Mourinho rivals, Mourinho identified what one man , Jose Mourinho needed last summer, and went out and got what. MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer am sure one man , Jose Mourinho was hurt by what happened to Chelsea last season, one man , Jose Mourinho first back at Stamford Bridge since one man , Jose Mourinho last spell ended in 2007. Despite not having a really top - class centre - forward Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side went very close to winning the title. Near - misses don' t mean anything to Mourinho, though. one man , Jose Mourinho addressed the main issue holding one man , Jose Mourinho side back by signing Diego Costa, who has scored the goals that were missing. Chelsea were also lacking a bit of guile in midfield, and Cesc Fabregas has provided the extra creativity there. Cesc Fabregas midfield partnership with Nemanja Matic, who Mourinho signed in January 2014 to sit and police the back four, is just one part of a team system that works perfectly. Chelsea have some top players, but Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side squad also has a great hunger and desire. has is down to Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side manager. By the end of the season, Chelsea will have broken the record for the most days spent on top of the table, and also the most consecutive days. Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side were joint - top with Manchester City at the start of January but, since Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side kicked Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side first ball of the campaign, the only time Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side have not been at the summit was after the second round of games. Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side players had the character to deal with it. From August onwards, Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side have been the team to beat and the best team full - stop. been underlines Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side consistency over the last nine months, and shows the almost total control Jose Mourinho ' s Chelsea side have had on the title race. Even when Chelsea were hit for five by Tottenham on New Year' s Day, no panic set in. New Year ' s Day was one of Chelsea very few bad days, which are inevitable over a long season, but Chelsea never suffered a slump for a sustained period of time. Chelsea have never had to play catch - up in the title race and are not used to doing play in individual games either. Again, Chelsea are usually in control. Chelsea have scored the first goal in 27 out of Chelsea 35 league matches, which is obviously important for any team, but especially for Chelsea. When you have a defence like Chelsea do, Chelsea are very rarely pegged back when Chelsea get in front. I keep hearing that players need to be rested and rotated but Chelsea don' t do rotated, and Chelsea approach seems to have helped rather than hindered Chelsea. Instead, Mourinho uses a core group of players who start whenever a core group of players who start whenever they are available are available. a core group of players who start whenever they are available includes Eden Hazard, who is hardly ever taken off either, something that is rare for an attacking player. At the back, John Terry has been magnificent and John Terry has played every single minute of every league game. Media playback is not supported on this device. The rest of the back four - Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Cesar Azpilicueta - play whenever The rest of the back four - Gary Cahill , Branislav Ivanovic and Cesar Azpilicueta are fit. Compare the back four to, say, Manchester City who chop and change Manchester City who chop and change their defence a lot defence a lot and you can see the benefit of a settled unit who work relentlessly together. Chelsea have had 17 clean sheets out of 35 league games, and Chelsea have only conceded more than two goals twice. Chelsea were pretty good at the back in the first half of the season when Chelsea were scoring goals freely. Until 17 January, only Southampton had conceded fewer goals. But in the past few weeks when Chelsea have been more pragmatic in the way Chelsea have been getting results, Chelsea have been even better at the back. From August to January, Chelsea played some sparkling football and you only have to look at Chelsea attacking statistics to see that Chelsea were anything but dull. So Chelsea earned the right to play the way Chelsea have been in the last few weeks, when Chelsea have been protecting Chelsea lead at the top of the table. I put that change in approach down to form and fitness of some of Chelsea players, with Costa' s absence being the obvious example. The important thing was that Chelsea kept winning, though, and Chelsea have done kept. None of Chelsea rivals have managed it over the duration of the season and the way Alan Shearer would sum up this campaign is that Chelsea have been brilliant and the rest of the league has not been good enough - by quite a margin. City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool have all been disappointing, especially when you look at the money City , Arsenal , Manchester United and Liverpool have spent, because City , Arsenal , Manchester United and Liverpool are further away from Chelsea now than City , Arsenal , Manchester United and Liverpool have been for a while. Chelsea have done the job Chelsea set out to do at the start of the season, which is to win the title. Chelsea have the best defensive record in the Premier League and only City have scored more goals. Chelsea also have the best player, Hazard. Put all of that together and Alan Shearer just cannot accept Chelsea are dull. Chelsea have not got the credit Chelsea deserve but Alan Shearer don' t think got bothers Mourinho one iota. Media playback is not supported on this device. The only thing that matters to Mourinho ' s is winning the Premier League, and Mourinho ' s has done winning with ease. Mourinho ' s has Mourinho ' s third title in English football, and now Mourinho ' s will want more. Mourinho ' s can get more with this Chelsea team, which certainly does not need much work done to this Chelsea team , which certainly does not need much work done to it over the summer over the summer. Alan Shearer am pretty sure a centre - forward will be high on Mourinho' s shopping list because we have seen how much Chelsea have missed Costa when Costa has been out. Also, Didier Drogba is 37 now and Alan Shearer am not sure how long Didier Drogba can keep going. But the main thing for Chelsea is that Mourinho is not going anywhere - while Mourinho ' s is around, there are more trophies to come. Alan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport' s Chris Bevan.",

Lord Janner was accused of abuse allegations during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s - but was deemed unfit to stand trial in England because of dementia. The former MP has consistently denied all allegations against Lord Janner. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the allegation had first been made in 1991 by a Leicester man who told police that Greville Janner sexually abused a Leicester man who told police that Greville Janner sexually abused him during the 1970s - including in Scotland during the 1970s - including in Scotland. Police in Leicestershire investigated allegations against the politician - who represented two constituencies in Leicester between 1970 and 1997 - in the 1990s but no charges were brought, BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds added. However Scottish police have reviewed files from the original claim relating to the alleged abuse in Scotland and are now carrying out Scottish police own investigation, our correspondent said.\" Because Scotland has a separate and independent prosecutor, Scotland would be able to make Scotland own decision about whether to charge Lord Janner,\" BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds added.

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Satellite images show colonies moving colonies locations in years when the thin sea ice on which these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition habitually breed forms late or is absent. Scientists report the observations in the online journal Plos One. this study on four colonies around the continent reveal the birds travelling long distances to find alternative sites. alternative sites are further in towards the coast, up on the ice shelves - the thick slabs of glacier ice that jut out over the ocean. It is a surprise because these shelves are frequently faced with cliffs that may be tens of metres high in places. But somehow, the emperors find a way up to breed, and also to come and go as these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition forage for the seafood that will sustain these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition chicks.\" We thought that in years when the sea ice was bad, these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition just didn' t breed, but these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition' re clearly more adaptable than that,\" said lead author Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey. The emperor is the most southerly of the Antarctic penguin species and the only one to breed on sea ice in the southern winter. the species reliance on these thin seasonal marine floes as a reproductive platform, coupled with concern about how the patterns of Antarctic sea ice could change in a warming world, has led to the species being designated as\" near threatened\" on the IUCN red list. Currently, the extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing year by year, albeit slowly. The coverage does however vary considerably by region, and climate computer models indicate any gains will very likely be reversed later this century. But this study on four colonies around the continent suggests emperors do have the capacity to meet and beat some of the challenges that may lie ahead. In the observations of Shackleton Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, for example, the penguins are seen to be very adept at finding the routes that allow these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition to get past a 30m - high cliff.\" When these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition go out from the colony to forage, these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition go down the steep cliff - the shortest route to the sea. We' re not sure how these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition get down - these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition may slide down or jump down,\" Mr Fretwell told BBC News.\" But this cliff is too steep for these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition to climb back up and so these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition must return a different way, likely through an ice creek. This route is 5km longer and We know these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition take a different way , likely through an ice creek because We can see these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition tracks in the satellite pictures.\" There is a big opportunity here to go study these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition. There is obviously some cost to going up on the ice shelves - the shelves are windier and the birds must travel further to forage. If that cost was not there, these animals would habitually breed on the shelves rather than the temperamental thin floes. But how big this cost is and how beneficial is the observed adaptation in years of poor sea ice has yet to be properly established. Co - author Barbara Wienecke from the Australian Antarctic Division said:\" These new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals. However, we cannot assume that this behaviour is widespread in other penguin populations.\" The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment - from sea ice to ice shelf - in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected.\" We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions.\" Jonathan.

But we have to put it into perspective.\" This still represents just 0. 11 % of the EU population. In Lebanon refugees represent 25 % of the population.\" The mass migration has seen those seeking an end to persecution, conflict and hardship travel from Turkey across the sea to Greece, through Macedonia and Serbia, and then to Hungary from where those seeking an end to persecution , conflict and hardship aim to reach Austria, Germany and Sweden. On Wednesday, Denmark suspended all rail links with Germany and shut a section of motorway after migrants crossed the border and began walking north, apparently trying to reach Sweden. In southern Hungary, migrants on the border with Serbia broke through police lines at the Roszke camp, forcing the closure of the M5 highway.

The new plans would relocate 60 % of those now in Italy, Greece and Hungary to Germany, France and Spain. The numbers allocated to each country would depend on GDP, population, unemployment rate and asylum applications already processed.

Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said compulsory quotas were\" not a good solution\", while Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka Slovak counterpart called compulsory quotas\" irrational\". Poland and Romania have also opposed the idea, although Poland has agreed to take in more migrants. France welcomed the first of 1, 000 migrants France has pledged to take from Germany, having committed to receive 24, 000 migrants over two years. In a separate development Australia has announced plans to take in 12, 000 Syrian refugees. Germany has welcomed Syrian migrants, waiving EU rules and saying Germany expects to deal with 800, 000 asylum seekers this year alone - though not all will qualify as refugees and some will be sent back.

A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

The charge comes during a difficult time for Mr Trump, just ahead of next week' s Wisconsin primary where The New York property developer is neck - and - neck with Senator Ted Cruz.

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Dame Margaret Hodge' s review said it would be better to ditch the Garden Bridge than risk uncertain costs. Three months ago the Garden Bridge Trust admitted the Garden Bridge Trust future was in doubt after publishing accounts which showed a £ 70m shortfall in funding. Initially £ 60m of public money was pledged on planning for the bridge. Transport for London pledged £ 30m, but £ 20m of £ 30m was to be a loan, and the rest was from central government. Dame Margaret says £ 37. 4m had already been spent, and even if the bridge did not go ahead it would cost the taxpayer £ 46. 4m. The Garden Bridge Trust said the Garden Bridge Trust was seeking a meeting with the London mayor to discuss next steps, but added the trust was\" determined\" to make the bridge happen. Dame Margaret, the MP for Barking and Dagenham and former chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee was asked to examine the project by London Mayor, Sadiq Khan in September. On Friday, Dame Margaret said:\" Value for money for the taxpayer has not been secured.\" It would be better for the taxpayer to accept the financial loss of cancelling the project than to risk the potential uncertain additional costs to the public purse if the project proceeds.\" Dame Margaret said decisions on the Garden Bridge were driven more by electoral cycles than value for taxpayers ' money. Dame Margaret , the MP for Barking and Dagenham and former chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee review also found costs spiralling out of control from an early estimate of £ 60m to over £ 200m now. Moreover, the review found the\" risk to the taxpayer has intensified\", while the original ambition to\" fund the Garden Bridge through private finance has been abandoned\". Other findings include:. Dame Margaret' s review criticised the tendering process for the design of the Garden Bridge created by the previous City Hall administration. Dame Margaret Hodge ' s review stated architects the Heatherwick Studio were given a head start in the process having already been closely associated with the project for five months before invitations to tender were sent out. Two other firms that took part in the tendering process - Wilkinson Eyre and Marks Barfield - were given just eight working days to submit designs, the review said. David Marks, co - director of Marks Barfield, told the BBC:\" This competition didn' t smell right from the start. It is clear that Marks Barfield were just there to make up the numbers and the outcome of this tender had in reality already been pre - determined.\" Had Marks Barfield been aware of Heatherwick Studios ' involvement and original idea, Marks Barfield would certainly not have submitted a tender. \" We' ve never been asked to do something in such a short space of time.\" the report is 40 pages of brutal, uncompromising criticism of nearly every part of the once flagship Garden Bridge project. I can' t remember reading a report so damning of a transport project. Procurement, finances, business cases, value for money, previous mayors, deputy mayors and transport officials get an absolutely withering assessment. the once flagship Garden Bridge project was meant to be an oasis of green calm hanging above the Thames. Now a report has basically recommended the once flagship Garden Bridge project be cancelled and the taxpayer take a hit on a project whose overall cost is now upwards of £ 200m. It will be very difficult for the project to withstand this. The big question now is will the present Mayor Sadiq Khan just let the once flagship Garden Bridge project wither or kill the once flagship Garden Bridge project? Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Garden Bridge Trust, said:\" the Garden Bridge Trust will be studying the report in detail and seeking a meeting with the mayor to discuss next steps.\" The Trust remains as determined as ever to make the Garden Bridge happen which will bring huge benefits to London and the UK.\" A City Hall spokesman said:\" The Mayor has been absolutely clear that the present Mayor Sadiq Khan will not spend any more of London taxpayers ' funds on the Garden Bridge.\" It is the Garden Bridge Trust that remains responsible for raising the necessary funds, and delivering the project.\"",

The committee had considered plans - backed by deputy Leader Tom Watson - to reinstate elections to the shadow cabinet. Since 2011, the party leader has selected Mr Corbyn own top team. Mr Watson said the proposal could help Labour\" put the band back together\" for a possible early election. A proposal to decide on the details of the plan ahead of Saturday' s leadership election result was voted down, by 16 votes to 15. Mr Corbyn was among those to vote against A proposal to decide on the details of the plan ahead of Saturday ' s leadership election result, but did agree to further talks with Mr Watson and other senior figures before the next NEC meeting this weekend, at the party' s conference in Liverpool. Mr Watson said afterwards that A proposal to decide on the details of the plan ahead of Saturday ' s leadership election result was a\" very positive meeting\". deputy Leader Tom Watson added:\" NEC agreed 22 changes to our rules and guidance, all sorts of positive things deputy Leader Tom Watson' m sure the media will be really interested in.\" Many MPs see elections as a way of constraining Mr Corbyn, should Mr Corbyn be re - elected as leader, and ensuring a balance of opinion at Labour' s top table. Supporters of Mr Corbyn say any plan should call for party members and activists to also have a say in any elections. The Labour leader has said there is a\" thirst for democracy\" in the party and Mr Corbyn backs a\" widening of the franchise\". Mr Watson also called for Labour' s leadership election rules to be changed to exclude registered supporters who pay a one - off fee to vote. deputy Leader Tom Watson described registered supporters who pay a one - off fee to vote participation as\" unpopular\" and suggested a return to a franchise of party members, trade unionists and MPs. In last year' s contest, 84 % of the 105, 598 registered supporters who paid Â £ 3 to vote backed Jeremy Corbyn. This time around, they were asked to pay Â £ 25 to take part. Despite the increased fee, 129, 000 people are thought to have applied successfully for a one - off vote in the contest between Mr Corbyn and Mr Corbyn challenger Owen Smith - the result of which will be announced on Saturday. Registered supporters were given a say in the choice of leader as a result of changes brought in by Ed Miliband, and approved by the party in 2013, designed to open up the process to a wider audience. Critics have said changes brought in by Ed Miliband , and approved by the party in 2013 , designed to open up the process to a wider audience allowed the leadership election to be hijacked by far - left groups with far - left groups with their own agenda own agenda - although Mr Corbyn easily won the most support among all groups - including party members, trade unionists and other affiliated supporters. Mr Watson, who Mr Watson , who himself was elected deputy leader last year using the same franchise was elected deputy leader last year using the same franchise, said the reforms had been\" rushed\" and\" unpopular\". Mr Watson , who himself was elected deputy leader last year using the same franchise suggested a return to the previous system used to elect Mr Miliband and Mr Miliband predecessors - in which voting was limited to an electoral college of party members, trade unionists, affiliate supporters and elected representatives of the party.\" We created a new category of member - a registered supporter - that was pretty unpopular in all sections. We want to remove a new category of member - a registered supporter - that was pretty unpopular in all sections and We want also want to enfranchise ordinary trade unionists in the process,\" Mr Watson , who himself was elected deputy leader last year using the same franchise said.

The following month the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip had an affair. the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip said the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip would like to\" get rid of [ the chef Jamie Oliver] and tell people to eat what people like\". Later the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as\" too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs\" and associating Papua New Guinea\" with orgies of cannibalism and chief - killing\". The London mayor' s life has been as exotic as Mr Johnson , who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party use of language.

There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson' s part at being overtaken by Mr Johnson , who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party younger rival. At Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant Mr Johnson , who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, Mr Johnson , who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as the Daily Telegraph Brussels correspondent and assistant editor. In Mr Johnson , who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party seven years as MP for the ultra - safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 Mr Johnson , who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice - chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture. Mr Johnson , who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign Mr Johnson , who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as Mr Johnson , who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party beat Mr Livingstone by 54 % to 47 %. Days after Mr Johnson , who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party victory Mr Johnson , who flirted briefly with the centre - left Social Democratic Party banned alcohol consumption on public transport.

Although suffering a series of high - profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair' s departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said Sir Ian Blair ' s was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson.

In 2011 Mr Johnson told the BBC' s Newsnight Mr Johnson did not expect to do\" another big job in politics\" after leaving the mayoralty. told was not universally accepted at face value. Mr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about Mr Johnson ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond Mr Johnson remit in London, in particular on Europe.

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. I give Dingledine ' s the benefit of the doubt - Dingledine ' s arguably blasé attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend Dingledine ' s creation. Dingledine ' s is the co - creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web. To some, Tor is a menace: a ( largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet. To others, Tor , the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted. Dingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with the dark web - with its drug deals , weapons sales and child abuse imagery drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, Dingledine ' s argues. But we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year' s Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas. The timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200, 000 users and $ 1bn ( £ 0. 7bn) a year in revenue. Dingledine' s talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in Dingledine ' s talk Dingledine ' s criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web.\" Dingledine ' s think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,\" Dingledine ' s tells I,\" where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read journalists article.\" The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and The story' s been the story for a while - so journalists need a new story.\" The Tor Project' s website has a section called\" Abuse FAQ\". It is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that Tor , the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes. When talking about the most controversial side of Tor use : that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes, Dingledine invokes the\" guns don' t kill people\" defence. Tor does not commit crime, Dingledine ' s says, criminals do.\" Dingledine ' s would say that there are bad people on the internet and bad people' re doing bad things, but Tor does not enable bad people to do the bad things.\" It' s not like there' s a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists.\" I guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make a novice essentially untraceable online.\" Dingledine still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,\" Dingledine insists.\" Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There' s a lot of crime out there.\" In layman' s terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track. There have been rumours that law enforcement has\" cracked\" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid.\" As far as Dingledine know, no, law enforcement haven' t [ cracked Tor].\" Tor is the best option there is out there, but is doesn' t mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect.\" Any major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old - fashioned policing.\" Which is frustrating,\" Dingledine interjects,\" Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old - fashioned police work is hard, takes energy.\" Tor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden' s whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading\" Tor Stinks … but it could be worse\", the National Security Agency ( NSA) noted:\" the National Security Agency ( NSA ) will never be able to de - anonymise all Tor users all the time.\" Given this, you would think the US ( and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban the project ' s, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep the project ' s alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project' s inception in the nineties. Dingledine is confident that funding will continue.\" A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet.\" The reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In The FBI , CIA , military and others all ideal world, Tor would exist, but The FBI , CIA , military and others all would hold a secret key to break in. In 2014, Facebook' s London team announced Facebook ' s London team had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month. \" About 97 % of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and people want to go there more safely,\" Dingledine says.\" Whereas 3 % of the traffic has to do with this ' dark web ' thing …. Dingledine have to wave Dingledine hands when Dingledine say the phrase.\" The ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online. But given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor' s justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing.\" Dingledine think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un - free countries,\" Dingledine says. ___________.

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The secretary of state was, by all accounts, a member of the\" Remain Campaign\" lobbying against a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. So President Trump' s\" Climate Brexit\" was a blow to Mr Tillerson - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company Mr Tillerson used to head supports the accord while the government Mr Tillerson now represents does not. President Trump ' s \" Climate Brexit \" was also a blow to the State Department, and to diplomacy. How much of a personal setback is not clear because on President Trump ' s \" Climate Brexit \", as on other issues, Tillerson kept a low profile. Twenty - four hours after the decision, the only comment Mr Tillerson' d made was an aside at a photo - opportunity. Mr Tillerson declared that the US would continue the US efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things\" in perspective\". Tillerson had previously said the US should\" maintain the US seat at the table\" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation' s top diplomat and one that Mr Tillerson reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement. But publicly Mr Tillerson showed none of the passion demonstrated by Mr Tillerson predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president' s daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super - engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony. Mr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday - act - of - resistance, we don' t know. A State Department official said only that Mr Tillerson was in Mr Tillerson office and\" maintained Mr Tillerson schedule, preparing for Mr Tillerson trip today to Australia and New Zealand\". No doubt Pruitt ( and the climate change sceptic in the administration , Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt , who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that the climate change sceptic in the administration , Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt , who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony was preaching to a president sympathetic to the climate change sceptic in the administration , Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt , who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony economic and nationalist arguments. But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. Mr Tillerson' s already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut Mr Tillerson department. And the president' s son - in - law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than Mr Tillerson does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House. Clearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement. Where the State Department , which has yet to issue a statement once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, the State Department , which has yet to issue a statement' s now been dropped off the map. The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement. Finally, it' s a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck.\" The US have now slapped every country in the world in the face,\" says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration.\" The US' ve said The US know this matters to every country in the world a lot, The US know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, The US know that some of every country in the world are particularly vulnerable, but The US drop out. drop' s the worst way you could treat other countries.\" To be fair, it is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush' s decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty. But it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. international diplomats from across the global spectrum struggle to find the people who can listen to international diplomats from across the global spectrum concerns or tell international diplomats from across the global spectrum what' s going on. So while it will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends. Follow Barbara on Twitter.",
