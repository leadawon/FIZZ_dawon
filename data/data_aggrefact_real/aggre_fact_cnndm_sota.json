Ogane claims that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not connected to the £200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward against Albirex Niigata in March . FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto .

International goals: 1 . Did you know? Muto graduated from Keio University in Tokyo with an economics degree two weeks ago . Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said: 'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. 'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, would be the first Japanese player to represent Chelsea if he moves to west London.

A £4million deal for the youngster has been mooted, but Muto admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Muto scored 13 times in his debut season with FC Tokyo and was named in the J-League's best XI.

The 22-year-old has a shot at goal during Japan's Asian Cup match against Palestine in January this year . He has continued his fine form during the current campaign, helping his club to third place in the division with three goals in four games. Yokohama Rubber - one of the world's largest tyre manufacturers - will become Chelsea's official shirt sponsors from the start of the 2015-16 season.

    "document": "Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. This frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys. 'Epidemic': By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight (file photo) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak.",

    "document": "This is the embarrassing moment a Buckingham Palace guard slipped and fell on a manhole cover in front of hundreds of shocked tourists as he took up position in his sentry box. The Queen's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera. He lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle. The Queen's Guard (pictured) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week. Unfortunately for him, the entire incident was caught on a tourist's camera . The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded . The moment it all started to go wrong: The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip . The unidentified young guard's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away . The guard, wearing full regalia, falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up . 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard.

Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House. The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day. He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s. Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s . But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified, he claims. Mr Lawler, now 64, said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother’s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27. He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift. Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them – one a senior member of staff, he said. He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself. ‘That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me,’ he told the Sunday People. ‘I was staggered. The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me, holding me in the chair. Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence . ‘They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room.’ Afterwards, Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet. A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House – so he packed his bags immediately. Mr Lawler, a former Port of Liverpool police officer, said he was ‘haunted’ by the incident for years. After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace, but was twice rebuffed. Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard. A retired royal aide, who is now in his 80s, was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time.

    "document": "A dress worn by Vivien Leigh when she played Scarlett O'Hara in the classic 1939 film Gone With the Wind has fetched $137,000 at auction. Heritage Auctions offered the gray jacket and skirt, featuring a black zigzag applique, plus more than 150 other items from the Academy Award-winning film at auction on Saturday in Beverly Hills, California. The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. Scroll down for video . An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday . The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color . The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite, played by Vivien Leigh, and co-starred Clark gable as Rhett Butler . Hattie McDaniel (left), Olivia DeHavilland (middle), and Vivien Leigh: McDaniel famously became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award . Other top selling items from the auction were a straw hat worn by Leigh that sold for $52,500; the trousers and jacket from a suit worn by Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, selling for $55,000; and a black bonnet worn by both Leigh and Olivia De Havilland as Melanie Wilkes, which fetched $30,000.

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said.

    "document": "Sir Bradley Wiggins will bid for cycling's hour record on June 7 at London's Olympic Velodrome. The four-time Olympic champion and 2012 Tour de France winner, who is 35 on April 28, will attempt to add to his accomplishments by riding the furthest distance in 60 minutes at the Lee Valley VeloPark. 'The Hour Record is a holy grail for cyclists,' Wiggins said. Four-time Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins will bid to break cycling's hour record in June . Wiggins finished his Team Sky career in the Paris-Roubaix 253.5km one-day race on Sunday . Australian rider Rohan Dennis poses after breaking the world hour record on February 8 in Grenchen . 'It's been fought over tooth and nail by some of the greatest names in our sport for over a hundred years and it's time for me to have a crack at it. 'I like the idea of challenging myself and want to motivate people to do the same - so why not get your bike out of the shed and see how far you can go in an hour?' Wiggins, whose track pedigree includes three Olympic gold medals, is expected to set a mark which will last for some time. Wiggins will hope for a capacity 6,000 crowd to spur on his attempt, with tickets going on sale from April 19, while the event will be broadcast live on Sky Sports. In June, Wiggins will hope to race in front of a sell-out crowd at London's Olympic Velodrome . Wiggins (left) alongside his Team Sky colleague Luke Rowe after the pair raced the Paris-Roubaix . Wiggins will look to beat the record of Dennis (pictured), who managed to cycle 52.491km in an hour . The Briton finished his Team Sky career at Paris-Roubaix last Sunday and will ride in next month's inaugural Tour de Yorkshire for his eponymous team before preparing for the Hour as part of his return to the track. The world time-trial champion is targeting a British record eighth Olympic medal - he has four gold, one silver and two bronze - at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the four-man, four-kilometre team pursuit. The current Hour record is 52.491km, set by Australian Rohan Dennis in February after the UCI, cycling's world governing body, reformed regulations, reigniting interest in the event. German Jens Voigt was the first to make an attempt last September, recording 51.115km, a mark which stood for six weeks before Austria's Matthias Brandle rode 51.852km, while Jack Bobridge was the first to fall short in his attempt.

    "document": "Sir Bradley Wiggins will bid for cycling's hour record on June 7 at London's Olympic Velodrome. The four-time Olympic champion and 2012 Tour de France winner, who is 35 on April 28, will attempt to add to his accomplishments by riding the furthest distance in 60 minutes at the Lee Valley VeloPark. 'The Hour Record is a holy grail for cyclists,' Wiggins said. Four-time Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins will bid to break cycling's hour record in June . Wiggins finished his Team Sky career in the Paris-Roubaix 253.5km one-day race on Sunday . Australian rider Rohan Dennis poses after breaking the world hour record on February 8 in Grenchen . 'It's been fought over tooth and nail by some of the greatest names in our sport for over a hundred years and it's time for me to have a crack at it. 'I like the idea of challenging myself and want to motivate people to do the same - so why not get your bike out of the shed and see how far you can go in an hour?' Wiggins, whose track pedigree includes three Olympic gold medals, is expected to set a mark which will last for some time. Wiggins will hope for a capacity 6,000 crowd to spur on his attempt, with tickets going on sale from April 19, while the event will be broadcast live on Sky Sports. In June, Wiggins will hope to race in front of a sell-out crowd at London's Olympic Velodrome . Wiggins (left) alongside his Team Sky colleague Luke Rowe after the pair raced the Paris-Roubaix . Wiggins will look to beat the record of Dennis (pictured), who managed to cycle 52.491km in an hour . The Briton finished his Team Sky career at Paris-Roubaix last Sunday and will ride in next month's inaugural Tour de Yorkshire for his eponymous team before preparing for the Hour as part of his return to the track. The world time-trial champion is targeting a British record eighth Olympic medal - he has four gold, one silver and two bronze - at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the four-man, four-kilometre team pursuit. The current Hour record is 52.491km, set by Australian Rohan Dennis in February after the UCI, cycling's world governing body, reformed regulations, reigniting interest in the event. German Jens Voigt was the first to make an attempt last September, recording 51.115km, a mark which stood for six weeks before Austria's Matthias Brandle rode 51.852km, while Jack Bobridge was the first to fall short in his attempt. Dennis' mark will come under threat from Briton Alex Dowsett, who will make his attempt on May 2 in Manchester having had to postpone it previously after suffering a broken collarbone.

    "document": "(CNN)Eight Iranian border guards have been killed in clashes with militants near the border with Pakistan, Iranian state media reported. Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur, the state-run news agency IRNA reported. The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari, the deputy governor of Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province, who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan. Iranian officials have reportedly asked Pakistani authorities to catch the surviving assailants. A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization. According to Pakistani media, Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan, the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran. The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory. One of the deadliest was in October 2013, when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan. Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks, the militants have fled back into Balochistan. \"Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists,\" IRNA said, referring to Pakistan. The Pakistani government condemned Monday's attack, calling it an \"act of terrorism.\" \"The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident, which took place on Iran's territory, and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have,\" the government said in a statement Wednesday.

    "document": "(CNN)The classic video game \"Space Invaders\" was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. \"When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,\" Nakatani said. He continued: \"They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth.\" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as \"among the most respected men in sports-entertainment\" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's \"basketball diplomacy\" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

    "document": "Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man . A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail.",

Japanese photographer Yûki Aoyama's latest series of images capture po-faced teenagers pictured next to their fathers leaping into the air. In each picture the daughter looks directly into the camera smiling while her father pulls a dramatic pose. A series of images by photographer Yûki Aoyama sees fathers leaping into the air next to their daughters . The images are from the 37-year-old's latest book which roughly translates into Daughter and Salary Man. According to the  photographer's website the images allow the father who usually has to act serious to express his fun side by being 'a hero jumping the sky, enfold(ing) strong excitement and hope.' Salary man may refer to the choice of clothing in the shoot which sees each dad in a sharply dressed suit. The images see the fathers pull energetic poses despite their age with some of the expressions of the older fathers looking slightly pained. Very little else is known about the pictures or why they have come into existence but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online for their curious nature. The 37-year-old's images are said to be part of a book which roughly translates as Daughter and Salaryman . Each image sees the daughter stood po-faced as their father makes an energetic leap . Some of the older fathers adopt a pained expression as they make their jump . Each photograph sees the daughter wearing casual clothing with her father in a sharp suit . The pictures see the families pose in front of various Japanese landmarks . Very little is known about the set of photos but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online . Some of the jumps are more subtle than others with this father opting for a classic jump . This young girl can't help but giggle at her dad's ambitious leap .

A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the Dallas Morning News. She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials. At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her. A spokesman for the police department said: 'There was some discussion, some rumoring, there may have been a second person involved. 'That information came from within the school, and it turned out to be true.' Granado, who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas (pictured), was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy, also 15, and lettin him touch her breasts . Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday, and released after posting a $50,000 bail. It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her. A spokesman for Irving school district said: 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details, we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action. 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property.'",

Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday, and released after posting a $50,000 bail. It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her. A spokesman for Irving school district said: 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details, we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action. 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property.'",

The clip shows a large croc calmly moving through the marina in the tourist hotspot of Puerto Vallarta, in Mexico, with a black dog wearing a red collar lifeless in its mouth. New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when the attack happened and described how 'the crocodile kept the dog in its mouth for ages, not moving at all'. Mr Weston told Daily Mail Australia the dog belonged to the local bike shop's owner. Scroll down for video . The large croc proudly held on to its catch for hours as it lurked around the Puerto Vallarta marina, in Mexico . 'There's a sanctuary for these crocodiles up the river (200m away) which runs out to the sea and the marina,' Mr Weston explained. 'The dog went to the water's edge to see the crocodile (being curious I guess) but things didn't go according to plan obviously. 'It was certainly a shock to the system. Guess that's nature though,' he said. In the video the beast glides through the water, with rocks on one side and a footpath on the other, as crowds gasp in amazement.

At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation . They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year. I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation. Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone . 'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope. We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all. Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope. We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.' James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth . Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday. But the Dutchman left with his own problems, after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice. Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules cannot be broken by anyone.

    "document": "A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.",

While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday . The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.'

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (left) hasn't disciplined Sterling (pictured) or Ibe for the incident . Ibe was present among the Reds squad during their training session on Friday ahead of their FA Cup semi . Rodgers, who has Steven Gerrard available for the FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa, spoke to Sterling and Ibe in his office on Thursday but neither will be disciplined and Rodgers now wants to draw a line under the matter. He said: ‘It is understanding that when you are a professional, elite sportsperson, there are things you can and cannot be doing and be seen to be doing. ‘It’s not just for your welfare but also because of your responsibilities. ‘It is difficult. Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things — and I’m not talking about this instance — (but) how it gets framed is totally different.’ Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard, available after a three-match suspension, an immediate recall against Villa, making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign. They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January, but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress. Reds have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension . ‘When you get so close, whether it was in the title race or the cup, it hurts,’ said Rodgers. ‘Trace back the winners in sport. If you look at everything they have won, also look at what they have lost. You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on. ‘Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals.

The German star was in fine form as the World Cup winners beat Georgia 2-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday, and is now setting his sights on the Premier League encounter with Liverpool at the weekend. And Ozil gave an insight into what he does in his downtime after taking a snap of him playing with his pet with the caption: 'Home Sweet Home'. Mesut Ozil posted a picture on Twitter relaxing with his dog on Wednesday after returning home to London . Ozil impressed on international duty as Germany beat Gerogia 2-0 in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday . The midfielder, who was signed for £42.5million from Real Madrid in 2013, missed Arsenal's last game against Newcastle through illness, but will be expected to start against Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium. Ozil was said to have been spotted in a Berlin nightclub after missing the Gunners' 2-1 win at St James' Park, though manager Arsene Wenger rubbished those claims. He has been doing the business on the pitch after returning from injury though,  wracking up four assists and scoring three goals since January. And the former Schalke man says he is finally adjusting to English football, claiming he fits in 'perfectly'. 'There are a lot of what we call 'English weeks' in Germany - where you play twice, and there's no winter break either,' he said. 'It's demanding because you don't have many breaks to recover, but as a footballer it's great to have so many games and I'm the sort of player who prefers playing in many matches - that's why I fit perfectly here.'

    "document": "Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’",

He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. \"The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,\" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.",

The Premier League title holders give star players like Sergio Aguero, David Silva, Joe Hart and Yaya Toure incentivised contracts to make sure the club stay within financial fairplay requirements and they will miss out on a big payday if City fail to reach the group stages of Europe's top competition. Manuel Pellegrini's lost to rivals Manchester United in the 169th Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday with their European hopes still in the balance. Manchester City stars such as Sergi Aguero could miss out on £500k bonuses if they finish fifth . Manuel Pellegrini's team are on incentivised contracts to stay within financial fairplay rules . City are in fourth place and will be just four points ahead of main rivals Liverpool after defeat in the Manchester derby and if Brendan Rodgers' side beat Newcastle United on Monday.

In total, the City squad have around £12million resting on reaching their European target. Pellegrini has admitted City have let their season disintegrate after starting 2015 joint-top with Chelsea. They have subsequently lost seven times including early exits in the FA Cup and Champions League.

Manuel Pellegrini's lost to rivals Manchester United in the 169th Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday with their European hopes still in the balance. Manchester City stars such as Sergi Aguero could miss out on £500k bonuses if they finish fifth . Manuel Pellegrini's team are on incentivised contracts to stay within financial fairplay rules . City are in fourth place and will be just four points ahead of main rivals Liverpool after defeat in the Manchester derby and if Brendan Rodgers' side beat Newcastle United on Monday. The top three finishers in the Premier League qualify automatically for the Champions League with the fourth-place team required to win a qualifying round to join them. In total, the City squad have around £12million resting on reaching their European target. Pellegrini has admitted City have let their season disintegrate after starting 2015 joint-top with Chelsea. They have subsequently lost seven times including early exits in the FA Cup and Champions League. Yaya Toure is another player who could miss out on a big payday if City fail to finish in the top four .

'We are doing some things very badly, that’s why we must improve.' They now face a battle to sign world-class players like Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba who also interests United. Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal saw his side go four points clear of City after the victory and is confident of adding top-class talent in the next transfer window.

For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team.

In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal.

    "document": "(CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: \"Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.\" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to \"reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California.

    "document": "(CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: \"Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.\" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to \"reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.",

The 69-year-old collaborated with NBC's Today show to launch a contest for one Elvis-obsessed couple to win the 'ultimate wedding'. The winning duo - announced next Monday - will tie the knot at Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel inside the Westgate Hotel on Thursday, April 23. Novel idea: Priscilla Presley will serve as a witness at the first wedding to be held at an all new chapel of love in Las Vegas . Westgate, formerly the Las Vegas Hilton, is where Elvis performed more than 830 sold-out shows. Along with the singer's former wife in the audience, the winning couple will  win a free wedding reception and hotel suite for two nights. To top it off, airfares and concert tickets to the Elvis Experience theater show will also be thrown in. While Priscilla agreed to make an appearance, the woman who wed Elvis in 1967 made one thing clear before unveiling the latest wedding chapel to bear his name: No impersonators. 'This is all first-class,' she told the Associated Press recently. 'This is not a joke. The wedding chapel is not a joke.' The actress and business magnate has been involved in the look and feel of the chapel that officials say is part of the first permanent Graceland exhibit of the singer's artifacts outside his iconic Memphis, Tennessee, home. Couples wanting to be the first  to  wed at the Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel must submit a video or photos along with an explanation detailing why they deserve the prize.

    "document": "Roma ended their four-month winless streak at home with a victory over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday in a key match for Champions League places. Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half. 'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack . Pjanic (second left) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe, and Daniele de Rossi after scoring . Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio, who play later on Saturday. They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth. Security was tight for Napoli's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game . Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points . Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order. But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post. A few minutes later, Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi, who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in. Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home . Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma, who have fallen off the pace recently . Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there wasn't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli, who officiated last year's World Cup final. In the second half, De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions. The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th. Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net. Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November.",

He has something about him, as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson’s face during the Ashes series. He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return.

The top two sides in Group B meet at the Cardiff City Stadium on June 12 with Wales in their best position to qualify for a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden. Belgium and Wales both have 11 points from five games with Marc Wilmots' side - ranked fourth in the world - on top spot because of a superior goal difference. Wales'  Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium this summer has been declared a 33,000 sell-out . Gareth Bale fires homes a brilliant free-kick during Wales' 3-0 victory over Israel in Euro 2016 qualifying . Real Madrid star Bale celebrates as the victory took Wales to the top of the Group B table on goal difference . But Wales' comprehensive 3-0 victory in Israel last weekend has seen expectations rise that Chris Coleman's charges can claim one of the two automatic qualifying spots and make it all the way to the 2016 finals in France. 'The stunning performance in Israel has created a huge buzz around Chris Coleman's team and the FAW has been inundated with orders for tickets,' the Football Association of Wales said in a statement on its website. 'Due to overwhelming demand, general admission tickets for the European qualifiers match between Wales and Belgium at the Cardiff City Stadium have now sold out.' It is understood the Wales squad prefer to play at the Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium . There had been speculation that Wales would play Belgium at the 74,500 capacity Millennium Stadium with so much interest in the match. But that was never going to happen as UEFA rules prevent the venue being changed within 120 days of the scheduled date. It is understood Gareth Bale and company would prefer playing at the more intimate Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium, where they have not played since meeting England in a Euro 2012 qualifier in March 2011.",

    "document": "A woman who suffered seven miscarriages has spoken of her distress after a family friend stole the money set aside for her babies' grave stone. The bereaved mother, named Dawn, was appearing on The Jeremy Kyle show and accused long-term chum, convicted burglar Jamie, of making off with the cash. When one of Mr Kyle's famous lie detector tests revealed that Jamie, who lives with Dawn and her partner who is also called Jamie, had done the deed, she burst into tears and stormed off. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Dawn, who has had seven miscarriages, was furious to discover her friend had stolen from her . The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that £207 set aside for a £500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.' Unable to prove it, she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back, it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash. Caught out: Jamie, who has been to prison for burglary, was found to be lying after taking a test . Outraged: Dawn, who was going to spend the money on a gravestone, was left furious by the revelation . Mr Kyle also revealed that Jamie had sent a Facebook message to Dawn during the journey to London in which he declared his undying love and confessed to taking the money but blamed it on girlfriend Carol. Speaking after the show, a sobbing Dawn said:  'I've had seven miscarriages and only one of them I've had to bury. 'That was Daniel James and the £207 was put aside because the head stone was going to cost £500 altogether. 'We had to stand there and say goodbye to Daniel James and the last thing I wanted to do for Daniel James was put a head stone on him so he knew how much his mummy and daddy loved him. I feel betrayed, horrible. You try and do a good gesture to people and then you get it thrown in your face.'

    "document": "(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.",

Rodgers' future at Anfield has been questioned after a third straight season without a trophy, but the former Liverpool defender backed the Reds manager. Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday, Carragher said: 'I don't think your whole future should be determined by one game. Jamie Carragher shared this image on Instagram after collecting a Beacon Award on Tuesday . 'It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four. 'That's his job. He has to identify where in the team they need to improve; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer. Brendan Rodgers is under pressure at Liverpool after a third straight season without a trophy . Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup by Aston Villa in a disappointing semi-final performance . 'The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. Carragher, pictured at the 26th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, backed Rodgers to stay at Anfield . The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. 'I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would. 'There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area.'",

Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four. 'That's his job. He has to identify where in the team they need to improve; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer. Brendan Rodgers is under pressure at Liverpool after a third straight season without a trophy . Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup by Aston Villa in a disappointing semi-final performance . 'The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. Carragher, pictured at the 26th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, backed Rodgers to stay at Anfield . The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. 'I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would. 'There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area.'",

    "document": "Four-year-old James Hayward had his toy gun confiscated at East Midlands Airport . A four-year-old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk. James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video . After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun . The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport . The £6 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.' East Midlands Airport said that 'no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item'",

    "document": "Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs . Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise) Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call . Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters . A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason. 'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write.

    "document": "(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for \"Barbara,\" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the \"warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited \"three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,\" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. \"For her to go to Mexico,\" Mate said, \"It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from.\" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to \"navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,\" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. \"Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look,\" Mate said.

    "document": "Residents on the east coast of Japan's Hokkaido Island had an unexpected change of scenery this morning after 1,000ft of seabed was forced to the surface overnight. The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby, when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video . Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan . 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide', local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday. The mass, which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level,  measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide, a town official said. The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the land movement overnight . 'The local residents said they didn't hear any sounds and there were no tremors (when the land appeared),' said Katsuhiro Tanaka, the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association, who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered. The mass, which has risen some 50ft above sea level, measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide .

The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby, when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video . Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan . 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide', local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday. The mass, which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level,  measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide, a town official said. The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the land movement overnight . 'The local residents said they didn't hear any sounds and there were no tremors (when the land appeared),' said Katsuhiro Tanaka, the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association, who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered.

In a bizarre statement on his party's website, Mr Katter said the Government believes Mr Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence - and later admitted to his criminal past. Mr Katter, federal MP for Kennedy, is of Lebanese descent. He said he's been personally subjected to racist attitudes from both major parties in the past, and that he sympathised with Mr Gordon's position. Federal MP Bob Katter, who released a statement today accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence . Mr Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history from Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk . He announced on Wednesday he will remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent, throwing the Government, which holds a razor-thin majority, into chaos. 'In the last two cases where this occurred in the federal parliament, there was never any question raised about the member resigning. So why was it assumed here that Billy Gordon would resign?' Mr Katter's statement reads. 'I can't help but think that the Queensland Government thought they had a little black puppet on a string. Mr Gordon, who  was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history . The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with users questioning his terminology. 'Irrespective of his weird use of the term 'black puppet' it's kinda odd how Bob Katter is speaking on Billy Gordon's behalf' wrote Benjamin James. Not that John wrote: 'Wow, Bob Katter calls Billy Gordon, 'black puppet on a string' and the lefty loons stay silent. What if Abbott had said it?' The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with some users questioning his terminology . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet in light of his personal experiences . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet 'because I'm dark and I come from Cloncurry.' 'I can understand and I can identify with the attitudes that these people have and I'm going to call it for what it is,' he said. 'I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought, because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones.' Mr Katter used federal MPs Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott as examples of independents becoming puppets for the government and sacrificing their independence, but he vowed Mr Gordon would not make that mistake.",

He said he's been personally subjected to racist attitudes from both major parties in the past, and that he sympathised with Mr Gordon's position. Federal MP Bob Katter, who released a statement today accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence . Mr Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history from Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk . He announced on Wednesday he will remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent, throwing the Government, which holds a razor-thin majority, into chaos. 'In the last two cases where this occurred in the federal parliament, there was never any question raised about the member resigning. So why was it assumed here that Billy Gordon would resign?' Mr Katter's statement reads. 'I can't help but think that the Queensland Government thought they had a little black puppet on a string. Mr Gordon, who  was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history . The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with users questioning his terminology. 'Irrespective of his weird use of the term 'black puppet' it's kinda odd how Bob Katter is speaking on Billy Gordon's behalf' wrote Benjamin James. Not that John wrote: 'Wow, Bob Katter calls Billy Gordon, 'black puppet on a string' and the lefty loons stay silent. What if Abbott had said it?' The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with some users questioning his terminology . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet in light of his personal experiences . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet 'because I'm dark and I come from Cloncurry.' 'I can understand and I can identify with the attitudes that these people have and I'm going to call it for what it is,' he said. 'I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought, because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones.' Mr Katter used federal MPs Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott as examples of independents becoming puppets for the government and sacrificing their independence, but he vowed Mr Gordon would not make that mistake.",

On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were \"unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,\" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will \"file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels\" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it \"one of the most dangerous close passes in decades.\" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident.

An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window.

    "document": "Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against Burnley at Goodison Park. The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick – awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon – rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch . Barkley's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park . Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it. Otherwise, I am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how they feel at that moment,' argued the Everton manager. Baines (left) has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League . 'Ross showed incredible responsibility to take it. I love seeing players take control of the big moments and Leighton was happy to given him that responsibility.' Barkley's penalty was well-struck but wasn't put in the corner and Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton dived to his right to save.

    "document": "Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction, and even the odd Bond movie. But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.",

But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.",

    "document": "A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'",

Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. \"In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,\" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,\" Sterling said.

The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title.

Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December – but didn’t have enough cash to pay for it. An inquest heard he ran from the driver, who gave chase at the seaside town of Penarth, South Wales. Cabbie Dave Sidaway told the inquest: ‘I stopped because I couldn’t see where I was going. I had no idea how much danger he was in.’ Jacob Phillips, 23, was found dead at the end of the disused Northern Promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff . The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to ‘use an ATM’ before making a run for it. ‘The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi – I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,’ Mr Robinson told the inquest. ‘Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.’ Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker. Paramedics arrived at the scene after his body was discovered in the morning by a dog walker . A long way down: Mr Phillips fell down this cliff after a night out.  Tthe taxi driver said he would not have left him if he knew where they were . Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Andrew Barkley said: ‘It is likely that he became disorientated and there is no evidence that he knew where he was at the time. ‘There is no way he could have known the danger that lay in front of him. The following day with the benefit of light it was clear the danger he faced by the sheer drop off the cliff just yards beyond the fence.’ Mr Phillips worked for Pretty Green, the clothing label run by Oasis star Liam Gallagher. He had grown up in Barry, South Wales, before studying accountancy at the University of Birmingham. The inquest heard that he had returned to Wales for Christmas and had been staying with his mother in the upmarket Cowbridge area. Mr Phillips had planned to stay at a friend’s house but he and his friends didn’t have enough money to complete the journey, so decided to trick the driver by ‘dodging’ the fare. Mr Phillips ran off into the ‘pitch black’ and fell down a cliff at the end of the disused Northern Promenade – also called The Dardanelles. Police search the scene at the bottom of the cliff where his body was discovered .",

I had no idea how much danger he was in.’ Jacob Phillips, 23, was found dead at the end of the disused Northern Promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff . The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to ‘use an ATM’ before making a run for it. ‘The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi – I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,’ Mr Robinson told the inquest. ‘Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.’ Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker. Paramedics arrived at the scene after his body was discovered in the morning by a dog walker . A long way down: Mr Phillips fell down this cliff after a night out.  Tthe taxi driver said he would not have left him if he knew where they were . Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Andrew Barkley said: ‘It is likely that he became disorientated and there is no evidence that he knew where he was at the time. ‘There is no way he could have known the danger that lay in front of him. The following day with the benefit of light it was clear the danger he faced by the sheer drop off the cliff just yards beyond the fence.’ Mr Phillips worked for Pretty Green, the clothing label run by Oasis star Liam Gallagher. He had grown up in Barry, South Wales, before studying accountancy at the University of Birmingham. The inquest heard that he had returned to Wales for Christmas and had been staying with his mother in the upmarket Cowbridge area. Mr Phillips had planned to stay at a friend’s house but he and his friends didn’t have enough money to complete the journey, so decided to trick the driver by ‘dodging’ the fare. Mr Phillips ran off into the ‘pitch black’ and fell down a cliff at the end of the disused Northern Promenade – also called The Dardanelles. Police search the scene at the bottom of the cliff where his body was discovered .",

At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses. Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips. Scroll down for video . The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer . Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved . This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.",

    "document": "It's amazing what a bit of make-up can do. In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name. But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale. One commenter wrote: 'Your [sic] amazing at what you do. Promise has been posting YouTube make-up tutorials for six years now having started her channel in 2009 and now has 2.8 million subscribers. On her YouTube profile she writes:  'I use make-up to transform myself into famous celebrities and characters. 'It started out as a hobby 4 years ago and now I am here using this awesome platform to teach and entertain millions around the world.' Promise colours her lips in before adding a Mac lipstick on top - the make-up brand created a collection inspired by the film Promise uses a pair of tweezers to place false eyelashes onto her eyelid Her Facebook page states: 'I am not a professional make-up artist nor did take any lessons in it. I am purely self taught!' Along with Disney princesses, she's also transformed herself into the likes of Drake, Johnny Depp and Michael Jackson. In the four minute video Promise talks her viewers through the steps that she took to get her Maleficent look. She uses many products from Mac's Maleficent collection including the eye shadows and eyelashes. Here we look back at some of her other amazing looks...

Bueno played for Derby on loan five years ago, but with just five goals in 29 games he looked anything like Champions League material. After returning to Valladolid he moved to Rayo Vallecano and at the club with one of the lowest budgets in Spanish football he has had the season of his life. Now Champions League quarter-finalists Porto, coached by Spaniard Julen Lopetegui, are ready to poach him. Alberto Bueno (left) in action for Derby against Norwich during his unsuccessful spell with the club Bueno celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Real Union in November 2008 Bueno has scored 17 goals for Rayo Vallecano this season and could soon move to Porto AGE: 27 CLUBS (League record only) Real Madrid (2006-09): 97 apps, 22 goals Real Madrid (2008-09): 3 apps, 0 goals Valladolid (2009-13): 85 apps, 13 goals Derby (loan, 2010-11): 29 apps, 5 goals Rayo Vallecano (2013-) 65 apps, 26 goals Seventeen of the 35 goals that Rayo have scored this season have come from Bueno. He hit four in one game earlier this year against Levante and will be gunning for his old club on Wednesday night. Bueno came through at Real Madrid in the 2006-07 season when then manager Fabio Capello fast-tracked him from the C-team to train with David Beckham, Luis Figo and Raul. He eventually made his full debut in both La Liga and the Champions League two seasons later but like so many strikers from Real Madrid’s youth system before him he was going to have to leave to really launch his career. Following in the footsteps of Alvaro Negredo and Roberto Soldado he left the club in 2009 signing for Valladolid from where he spent a season at Derby before ending up back in Spain.

    "document": "Tim Sherwood has urged Aston Villa to man up as he labelled their clash with relegation rivals QPR the club's 'biggest game' for years. They host Rangers on Tuesday with Sherwood admitting he does not have the players to grind out results. Victory would move Villa five points clear of the Barclays Premier League drop zone but they will return to the bottom three if QPR, three points behind with a better goal difference, win. And Sherwood underlined the magnitude of the game ahead of the showdown. Tim Sherwood (from left to right), Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey during their time at White Hart Lane Sherwood (right) sits on the bench with Tottenham Hotspur staff Ferdinand (centre) and Ramsey (left) Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor celebrates his goal by saluting Sherwood (right) and Ramsey (centre) 'I think this is the biggest game that a lot of these players have ever played for this football club,' he said, with Villa in 17th. 'This is without doubt the biggest game of the season for Villa and possibly one of the biggest in a number of years. 'This is the biggest (of my managerial career).' But the boss believes he must instil a different mentality into his players as he tries to keep them in the top flight. 'We've got different types of players, you look through QPR's side and they've got a lot of players who are men - with a lot of experience in there,' he said. 'We've got a few men in there - but we've got a lot of pretty much icing-on-the-cake players and I'm trying to get that mentality into them to forget about digging out results. It's not what we're cut out to do. 'I haven't identified many players who can't cope with the pressure, but you don't know until they get out there.' Sherwood is without Alan Hutton, Ashley Westwood and Scott Sinclair while Tom Cleverley, Kieran Richardson and Aly Cissokho are doubts. Sherwood faces his friend and former Tottenham assistant, QPR boss Chris Ramsey, for the first time since they both left Spurs last summer.

He added: 'If there was ever an opportunity for me to work with him again I would do that. 'I would have to speak to the club about whether we could find a role for him here.

    "document": "John Carver knows only too well that a Tyne-Wear derby can make or break a manager. His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory – or a loss – could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that. 'We had a good football match last weekend (2-1 defeat at home to Arsenal) and got nothing for it. At the end of the day, it's all about getting the win.' Carver was also assistant manager to Alan Pardew, who lost four successive games against Sunderland",

    "document": "A series of images capturing the late actor Peter O’Toole on set for the last time have been released in conjunction with today’s release of Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria. In the pictures O’Toole, the star of 1962 classic film Lawrence of Arabia, can be seen laughing and joking with fellow cast members despite suffering from a long-term illness that would eventually prove fatal. Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria has been dubbed one of the biggest independent films for decades and features Steven Berkoff, Edward Fox, Joss Ackland and Nicole Keniheart alongside O’Toole. Scroll down for video According to Michael Redwood, inevitable wind-ups surfaced 'whenever the devil inside' Peter O'Toole needed entertaining Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria attempts to pay homage to Saint Katherine Director Michael Redwood paid tribute to O’Toole. He said: ‘Peter was certainly not the type to let illness decide over his career, and despite his being poorly at the time of filming, he remained full-on 10 hours a day, showing great interest in the storylines, angles of shots and the lighting.’ He added: ‘Of course, the inevitable wind-ups surfaced whenever the devil inside him needed entertaining. Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria attempts to pay homage to Saint Katherine by portraying her as a real women who experiences fear and torment while remaining steadfast in her beliefs regarding the denouncement of Rome’s enforced pagan worship upon the masses. Director Michael Redwood said Peter O’Toole was certainly not the type to let illness interrupt his career Redwood said: ‘My agenda was simple: painstaking research, to create an intelligent screenplay and to seek out Britain’s best performers for their unrivalled ability to help portray the story of this religious icon. ‘The dialogue demanded some of the world’s most recognisable voices such as Peter O’Toole and Edward Fox, who were an inspiration to work with. Katherine’s voice had to be most haunting in its delivery.’ The director also paid tribute to the late actor’s sense of humour and noted that his onscreen chemistry was quickly established with Keniheart on account of the pair discovering that they had both had similar, difficult pasts. Michael Redwood stated that on screen chemistry was quickly established between Peter O'Toole and Nicole Keniheart Director Michael Redwood has a word with Peter O’Toole on the set of Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria Redwood said: ‘Peter managed to politely subdue his mischievousness with Keniheart, but not for long, as she well found out when filming an intimate library scene together. ‘I'd asked Peter to perhaps whisper something to make Ms Keniheart smile after about 30 seconds of a long tracking shot that contained no dialogue, and what he said did indeed make her burst into a grin, but, what he said could never be printed.’ O’Toole enjoyed a long and decorated career and was nominated for a total of eight Academy Awards, received an honorary Oscar, and won four Golden Globes. Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria is available in cinemas and can be purchased on DVD starting today. Dudley Sutton, Peter O’Toole and Steven Berkoff enjoy a joke together while reading a magazine on set Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria is available in cinemas and on DVD from April 6",

    "document": "They are the peculiar concrete markings that have been spotted all across America, prompting hikers and travellers to wonder what on Earth they could mean and where they are pointing to. But these giant arrows, which can measure up to 70ft in length, are actually a forgotten remnant of a bygone age. Dotted among scrubland, placed in seemingly random spots, these huge arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the US - forming the first land-based navigation system in the world. A huge concrete arrow is found in perfect condition in Bloomington, Washington County, Utah The Bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith, who have travelled across the US to photograph the monuments The concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways, showing pilots the direction they needed to fly in to reach the next stop-off to deliver mail. Airmail in the US began as early as 1911, with the first official flight departing Petaluma, California, and arriving in Santa Rosa, California. As the flights got longer, with more frequent stop-offs, so the beacons and arrows were placed to help pilots on their way. Following World War One, the US Postal Service began to use surplus war planes for mail delivery and many were flown by former army pilots. The arrows define a moment in history at the beginning of the 21st century when the US Postal service began delivering air mail Perfectly set against the snow-capped mountains of Nevada, this arrow was photographed in Golconda, Humboldt County Captured near the tiny town of Medicine Bow in Wyoming, this beacon was on the famous New York to San Francisco route One of the most important flight routes and the first to be completed, stretched across the US from New York to San Francisco The giant arrows started to be placed across the country, sometimes at 10-mile intervals, from 1924. Painted bright yellow and placed alongside beacon with a gas light at the top, the idea was that the markers could be seen for a distance of up to 10 miles so pilots could find their way. In the summer of 1924, they stretched from Wyoming to Ohio and by the following year, the arrows had reached New York. By 1929, the arrows could direct flights all the way across the width of America. The main New York to San Francisco air route stretched from New York to San Francisco, following the yellow concrete trail. Medicine Bow town in Carbon County has a population of just 284 and was originally established due to the construction of a transcontinental railroad Not all the arrows are in good condition, with each passing winter more cracks appear in the concrete, such as with this arrow in Mote, Nevada Pumpernickle n Nevada has its own concrete arrow too, which one again is overlooked by the state's beautiful mountains In the days before radio and satellite communications, the arrows were a way to ensure pilots could find their way, even in poor weather. While the arrows are now long-forgotten, with many lost forever, there are fans who, having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside, have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind. Retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith were sent an email which piqued their interest and have been hunting down the arrows ever since. The email playfully explained: 'Every so often, usually in the vast deserts of the American Southwest, a hiker or a backpacker will run across something puzzling: a large concrete arrow, as much as seventy feet in length, sitting in the middle of scrub-covered nowhere.' The couple say they have found 102 arrows so far and have set up their website Arrows Across America as part of their photography site dreamsmithphotos.com so fellow fans can share their own pictures and help map where the remaining arrows are. The Smiths told MailOnline Travel: 'We have located 102 arrows or portions of arrows, some are badly deteriorated and not much is left. Arrowheads and ancient earth mounds have been discovered at Poverty Point, in Utah, but it also has a more recent concrete arrow A beacon has survived in good condition in New Mexico (left) and at Cottage Grove in Oregon (right) - many of these were lost as the metal was used in the war effort during the Second World War At Thayer Juntion, in Wyoming, there are boards that supply information about the arrows and their use to passers-by 'Our interest grew out of an email circulating in August 2013, we wanted to know where they were, and set out to find them. 'We have managed to take photos of approximately 40, and have a trip planned this fall to take more photos of some that we were unable to get to last spring. 'Eventually we hope to have photos of all the arrows that we have located, but time and money will dictate how long that will take us. 'Before our research we knew nothing about airways, beacons or concrete arrows, it has been a marvelous journey of discovery and we cannot believe that all of this has been \"forgotten.\"'.",

Boffins are currently working towards digitally recreating the cognitive abilities of the Apis Mellifera or European Honeybee. Their final aim is to build a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like the tiny insects. Scientists are working towards building a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like a honeybee Professor James Marshall said if they were able to recreate a fraction of the honeybees ability they would have made 'tremendous advances' The artificial brain is being created by the Green Brain Project, which is a collaboration between researchers from the Universities of Sheffield and Sussex. One day it is hoped the remote controlled machines could be used to pollinate crops or even assist on search and rescue missions. 'Bees and all other insects are miracles of engineering which we are nowhere near equalling,' Professor James Marshall reportedly told the BBC. 'If we could even recreate a fraction of their abilities in a robot system then we would have made a tremendous advance.' Building an artificial brain is a complex process and so far, scientist have only managed to clone the part of the bee's brain which allows it to see. To do this they mapped out the  brain of the honeybee and recreated it with circuits that fire on and off in an organic brain, Discovery Magazine reported. The software is then uploaded into the drone's circuitry which enables it to  fly around in a similar fashion to the bee. The projects team now has three quadcopters and one ground robot, each with unique abilities and configurations. Tests are being carried out in a dedicated flying room based at the University of Sheffield. In a video footage showing initial tests the drone, powered by the artificial bee brain, can be seen flying down a corridor. On the Green Brain website it states: 'Since the start of the project, the GB team has setup the lab, built and tested our robots, and begun to demonstrate some sophisticated visual-based navigation and cognitive functions through embodiment. 'Current projects include navigation using the GB models, flight tests of our models with the BeeBot quadcopter, developing a Ground Control Station, initial testing with the chemosensors and more.'

    "document": "Wanted: Police in Maryland have issued a warrant for the arrest of 26-year-old karate instructor Alexander Soumbadze who has been charged with eight counts of child pornography Police in Maryland have launched a manhunt for a 26-year-old karate instructor who has been charged with possessing child pornography. The Montgomery County Police Department said Friday that Alexander Soumbadze faces eight possession of child pornography counts. Soumbadze has recently admitted to trading and receiving child pornography, after which police say the Georgian national fled the country. An investigation also uncovered videos of the martial arts expert inappropriately touching and engaging in sexual acts with adolescent males at a Maryland karate studio where he was co-owner and instructor. Officials say the videos were taken before October 2011 and that they are attempting to locate victims to determine possible additional charges. According to Montgomery County police, the 26-year-old, a native of Tbilisi, Georgia, fled the US after confessing to the crimes. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of the Bethesda resident. According to a press release put out by the Montgomery County police Friday, in December 2014, the agency was tipped off by colleagues in South Dakota that a Maryland resident was uploading child pornography. Vile acts: Police have recovered videos showing the martial arts teacher (far right) molesting boys at the On The Mat Sports International in Chevy Chase, formerly known as DC Martial Arts Fugitive: The Tbilisi, Georgia, native admitted to trading child pornography videos earlier this month. Two days after his interview with police, he fled, possibly returning to his native country Armed with court orders, detectives in Maryland were able to obtain subscription information corresponding to the suspect, which led them to Soumbadze. On April 1, 2015, police executed a search warrant at Soumbadze’s home in Bethesda, seizing several electronic devices that yielded eight pornographic videos featuring children. Other recordings recovered by police allegedly showed the suspect molesting boys at his karate studio on Wisconsin Avenue in Chevy Chase. Soumbadze has been affiliated with the On The Mat Sports International karate studio, formerly known as DC Martial Arts, since he was a young child and took classes there as a martial arts student. During an interview with police, the 26-year-old sensei admitted to trading and receiving child porn. Close ties: Soumbadze has been affiliated with karate studio (pictured) since he was a young child and took classes there as a martial arts student Two days after Soumbadze was questioned by police, he fled the country, possibly returning to his native Georgia. Police spokeswoman Rebecca Innocenti told Bethesda Magazine that Georgia has an extradition treaty with the US, but their goal now is to complete the investigation and identify the victims in the videos before setting the diplomatic process in motion. In a profile of the On the Mat studio in February, Soumbadze told BethesdaNow.com that his parents, both Georgian diplomats, brought him to the US when he was 5 years old. He graduated from Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in 2006.",

    "document": "People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13% higher than a colleague The cost of divorce can wreck retirement many years after the break-up of a marriage, according to research. People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce. It means an extra £2,100 a year – £17,800 rather than £15,700 – to anyone who has kept their marriage intact, or who has never married, according to the survey for the Prudential. It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles. The debt of a divorced retiree averages £22,100, Prudential’s report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers. Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that £9,500 – the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday’s report said. The impact of divorce on a former spouse’s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working. The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up. Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health. The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult, studies suggests The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands, wives and children suffer during a divorce – usually including loss of income, the price of running two homes instead of one, legal costs, and the long-term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse – does not fade away even as old age approaches. Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children, a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through ‘pension-splitting’ arrangements. One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles, according to research Prudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat said: ‘Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement. ‘A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple will have to split in the event of a divorce. Professional advice is particularly important in the face of the recent changes to pensions legislation and divorced retirees acting on advice received under the previous rules may want to consider seeking updated advice on any post-retirement plans they have made. ‘During a divorce the costs can quickly mount up, with legal fees, the cost of setting up a new home and the effect of splitting any existing retirement savings all potentially impacting the ability of those involved to continue saving into a pension. Unfortunately divorce is most likely among those aged 40 to 44, the period in many people’s lives when earning potential peaks and the most valuable pension contributions can be made.’ The findings were based on a survey carried out by Research Pluse among 7,687 people aged over 45, who included 1,012 people intending to retire this year.",

    "document": "Gary Locke will be confirmed as Kilmarnock’s permanent manager on Friday - exactly eight weeks after he was asked to take charge until the end of the season. An announcement will be made by the Rugby Park club on Friday morning, with the former Hearts boss being given a three-year deal. And on Thursday the 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since he replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February. Kilmarnock will confirm Gary Locke as the club's new permanent manager on Friday ‘I’d be over the moon to get it as it’s something I’ve worked hard towards,’ said Locke while negotiations were being finalised at the Ayrshire club. ‘I had a taste of it (management) at Hearts and really enjoyed it. I’m fortunate I was put into this position at a great club. It’s a fantastic opportunity. ‘But I’ve said all along, it’s not about me. It’s about players. If they perform, you get a better reputation as a manager and that has been the case here with a great response from them. ‘That’s how football works. If they play well, your stock rises. Equally, if they don’t play well, it’s the manager who gets the stick. ‘I’ve got broad shoulders and I know what to expect but I can’t praise the players highly enough. They have worked so hard and they have taken on board everything I have tried to tell them.’ Ex-Killie and Hearts player Locke, who was crestfallen not to be retained by the Tynecastle club as head coach after they were relegated last season, added: ‘(Coaches) Alan Robertson and Billy Thomson have done a fantastic job in helping me, too. ‘You can’t do all of these things by yourself and backroom staff can be as important as the players. I can’t thank all of these people enough.’ Locke, who returned to Rugby Park last summer, had been working as No 2 under Johnston when the manager announced in February that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season, indicating that the £150,000 sale of teenage forward Robbie Muirhead to Dundee United had been a factor in his decision. After Johnston was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy, assistant Locke was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop-gap appointment. But he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship. They only suffered their first reverse under Locke when Ross County beat them 2-1 in Dingwall two weeks ago. Kilmarnock went unbeaten during Locke's first six games in charge of the club He has impressed Mann not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm. Kilmarnock are currently eighth in the Premiership and still remain in the hunt for a top-six place. It was expected that Locke would have been appointed permanently before now, but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top-six finish this season. ‘When you are dealing with contracts, they take a bit of time and I certainly don’t foresee any problems,’ he said. ‘There hasn’t really been a hold-up. As any player or manager will tell you, when it comes to the terms of a contract, it doesn’t just happen overnight. There are a lot of things to discuss and I have done that. ‘I will keep all that private because that is the way it should be and the club have dealt with it brilliantly. ‘I’ve no complaints there, so I hope it will be sorted before Saturday and I can concentrate on our home game against Motherwell. ‘Our new board of directors have been fantastic. I’ve been really impressed with the way that they have handled everything. The club itself is trying to be as positive as possible. ‘There are a lot of plans in place to make the club even better than it is right now, so there are loads of positives and I would like to be part of that.’ Having resolved his own situation, Locke will next week turn his attention to the futures of nine first-team players at Kilmarnock — Manuel Pascali, Alexei Eremenko, Craig Slater, Craig Samson, Sammy Clingan, Greg Kiltie, Conor Brennan, Chris Chantler and Mark O’Hara — who will become free agents this summer. ‘I’ve said for a number of weeks now that once my own position was sorted out, there are a few players out of contract and they will want to know what their futures are,’ he said. ‘So it will be great to get moving on all of that and prepare for next season. ‘You can’t do that until you are the main man.’",

    "document": "A new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis. The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Scroll down for video The white-cheeked macaque, from Tibet, China, has a distinctive rounded penis compared to other macaques Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in Tibet. Human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis, but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom. An evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species. He concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners, or even as a way of cooling the body down. The relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe in his latest 'How Did We Get Here?' video series for the University of New South Wales, Australia. Gorillas have small penises and small testicles, while chimps have medium-sized penises and large testicles. By comparison, human males have the longest penis and medium-sized testicles. 'Amazingly the size of the reproductive organs, especially the testicles, are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially,' explained Professor Curnoe. 'Why the difference? Well for the testicles it's pretty straight forward. 'It all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps, and their sperm, have when they mate with females.' But he said there wasn't a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. He said: 'Medog County is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science. 'Furthermore, it locates in southeastern Tibet and close to McMahon line which is a political sensitive area. Very few have people studied primates there. 'This species has long been identified as Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) because no clear photos or good specimens are available.' In an attempt to better study the animals living in the region, Cheng Li, a photographer with the Imaging Biodiversity Expedition in Beijing, set up camera traps in the area's remote tropical and evergreen mountain forests. They captured 685 photos of macaques and Mr Li was also able to follow a group of macaques allowing him to obtain close up images. When the researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, examined the images they started to notice some monkeys that had different features. They the animals hd relatively short hairless tails and almost white hairs around their face. They also had long thick hairs on their neck. But the most distinctive feature was the creatures genitalia. Most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises. However, Macaca leucogenys had far more rounded penis and a dark hairy scrotum. Scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails (like those above) and light coloured markings around their face, leading them to identify a new species of primate The images above show the more usual 'arrow-shaped' genitalia that macaques in the area have Videos also revealed that Macaca leucogenys produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by Macaca assamensis as an alarm call. Dr Fan said the species seemed to inhabit a diverse range of habitats and was found living in tropical forests at 1,395 metres, evergreen broad-leaved forests at 2,400 metres and a mixed broad leaf and conifer forest at 2,700 metres. However, the researchers, who also included Choa Zhao from the Southwest Forestry University in Kunming, China, warned that the new species may be under threat. They said: 'The white-cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations. The white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of Medog in south east Tibet, China The researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of Macaca leucogenys become paler and more prominent with age. Infants can be seen in the images A and B while a juvenile is labelled C. Adult females are in the image D and adult males are seen on the far right of image E. Adults have few dark hairs on their faces 'Discovery of this new primate species further highlights the high value for biodiversity conservation of southeastern Tibet and calls for more intensive surveys, studies, and environmental protection in this area.' Dr Fan added that it was possible there could be other species of primate still to be discovered in the area. He said: 'This area has been little studied. 'Although primates have been intensively studied for decades, two new macaque species (Macaca munzala and M. leucogenys) were discovered and described in this area in the past 10 years. 'As for other species groups that received less attention, We believe there are still some species remain undiscovered. 'It is highly possible that some primate species still remain undiscovered.' Adult Macaca leucogenys (above) have long hair on their muzzles simiarl to another species Macaca thibetana",

Al-Douri, 72, headed the Naqshbandi Order insurgent group, an important faction behind the recent rise of ISIS. Scroll down for video Al-Douri was an Iraqi military commander and was Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council, until the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the famous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse He was one of Saddam's most trusted henchmen, helping to lead his 1968 bloodless coup. Both Al-Douri and Saddam came from the same Tikriti tribal background. He was then deputy to Saddam when he was deposed following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December, 2006, Al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Ba'ath Party. Al-Douri was deemed the most high-profile official of Saddam's Ba'ath Party to evade capture after the invasion. He was ranked sixth on the US military's list of the 55 most-wanted Iraqis after offensive to overthrow Saddam and had a $10m bounty on his head. He was the King of Clubs in the infamous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse. His dead body was pictured on social media today with his teeth missing, an unkempt orange beard and a bloody head wound. Salahuddin governor Raed al-Jabouri said soldiers and allied Shia militiamen killed him in an operation east of Tikrit - a city that was recaptured by the government two weeks ago. He said: 'This is a major victory for those involved in the operation. He is considered a mastermind for this terrorist group. 'For sure this will have an impact on them...there will be a break among them.' ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. However, in recent months Iraqi forces, supported by US-led air strikes, have captured large areas from the terrorist group. But today, a car bomb killed three people outside the U.S. consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region that is allied with Washington in a war against Islamic State, which claimed the attack. No U.S. personnel were hurt in the blast, according to the State Department which said a 'vehicle-borne improvised explosive device' exploded right outside the entrance to the heavily fortified compound. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for two car bombings in Baghdad that killed at least 27 people on Friday. 'The fighters of the Islamic State detonated two car bombs in the heart of the Iraqi capital this evening and a third in Erbil,' the group said via its news agency. Such attacks are relatively rare in Kurdistan, which has managed to insulate itself from the worst of the violence afflicting the rest of Iraq. A car bomb killed three people outside the U.S. consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region, today Kurdish security forces respond to an explosion at the pedestrian entrance to the U.S. Consulate complex In the invasion of Iraq by a US-led coalition, the military developed a set of playing cards to help troops identify the most-wanted members of Saddam's regime. This was mostly high-ranking members of the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party or members of the Revolutionary Command Council. The cards were officially named the 'personality identification playing cards'. Each card contained the wanted person's address and, if available, the job they carried out. The highest-ranking cards, starting with the aces and kings, were used for the people at the top of the most-wanted list. Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the pack of cards.",

    "document": "(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the \"power of the press\" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and \"the return of class\" -- who express views like, \"Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies. At least Britt McHenry owns up to it.",

Herrera netted a brace against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon without actually looking at Brad Guzan's goal as his eyes appeared to be shut when making contact with the ball. In fact, six of Herrera's seven goals have been scored without him even having to glimpse at either the ball or the opposition's net. Manchester United star Ander Herrera scores his side's opening goal against Aston Villa with his eyes shut The Spanish midfielder appears to have his eyes closed as he strikes at Brad Guzan's goal Aston Villa and England midfielder Fabian Delph attempts to block Herrera's left-footed shot His eyes were wide open when he struck an impressive first-time shot against Yeovil in the third round of the FA Cup back in January. However his double against Aston Villa and his goals against Queens Park Rangers, Leicester, Preston and Swansea all came without Manchester United's summer signing having to make eye contact with the ball. Herrera appears to have a history of shooting with his eyes closed as the image of his goal for Spain's Under 20 side back in 2009 shows. Herrera hits the back of the net while representing Spain's Under 20 side against Tahiti The former Athletic Bilbao joined the Red Devils for £29million in the summer due to his vision and creativity in midfield. Louis van Gaal heaped praise on the 25-year-old's shooting ability after Saturday's Premier League encounter at Old Trafford, by stating: 'He has a very good kicking technique and he should be more composed,' Van Gaal said to MUTV. 'I said to him 'you have to control the ball before you shoot'. 'I said that to him again in yesterday's training session, and then I kissed him at half-time because he had controlled the ball for the first time in his life and then he shot.' Herrera's eyes were also shut for Manchester United's third goal against Aston Villa on Saturday His only Manchester United goal scored with his eyes wide open came against Yeovil Town back in January Herrera scored in Manchester United's 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers without looking at the ball The former Athletic Bilbao man flicked the ball past Preston's players without having his eyes on the ball Herrera scored in Manchester United's 2-1 defeat by Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium in February He also netted in Manchester United's shock 5-3 defeat at the hands of Premier League strugglers Leicester",

One of the men 38-year-old Lianna Barrientos wed was deported back to Pakistan for making threatening statements against the United States in 2006 after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, it has been revealed. Barrientos, originally from the Dominican Republican, lived with her partner and two children in the Bronx until her arrest in February, however was legally married to at least four people at the time. In court today, prosecutors said Barrientos married men from Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, Mali and Georgia - countries that were 'red flags' for immigration, according to The New York Daily News. At one time she was married to eight men simultaneously. Always the bride: Liana Barrientos, 39, of the Bronx, pleaded not guilty on Friday to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences Sullen: Barrientos, seen here in Bronx Supreme Court on Friday, is accused of marrying 10 men over the course of 11 years in an apparent immigrant scam Charged: The Bronx district attorney's office says she faces two counts of felony fraud charges Swindle: Barrientos is accused of accepting money in at least one of the marriages, prosecutors say All of her marriages took place in New York state, allegedly starting in 1999. Authorities only cottoned on after she said her 2010 marriage to Salle Keita, of Mali, -  the tenth time she tied the knot - was actually her first, the New York Post reported. This launched an investigation that unraveled a totaly of ten times Barrientos has allegedly walked down the aisle. Barrientos would spell her name differently on some marriage licenses and would file all over the state, in places including Westchester County, Mamaroneck, White Plains, Ramapo and Long Island, investigators said. Six of the sham marriages occurred in one year, authorities allege. The Daily News reported that it was her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, that was deported to his home country of Pakistan following an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. She has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences. 'This is a huge breach in security,' national security expert Manny Gomez told WABC. 'If someone could remarry 10 times without bringing it to the attention of the authorities, potentially an al-Qaeda plant could come in, marry this woman and be in this country illegally, plotting, recruiting, perhaps even executing a terrorist attack.'

The Times reported that for her first three 2002 marriages, Barrientos wed Koridze on Valentine's Day, before she went on to marry Goktepe approximately two weeks later, then soon tied the knot with Paharelau.

Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things — and I’m not talking about this instance — (but) how it gets framed is totally different.’ Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard, available after a three-match suspension, an immediate recall against Villa, making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign.

If you look at everything they have won, also look at what they have lost. You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on. ‘Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals.

But amateur footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch, where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff who were believed to have stopped his friends from walking between the stadium's West and East stands. Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after appearing to fight with stewards After initially being restrained (first photo), Spahic became involved in a clash with staff after the game Spahic later seemed to aim a headbutt at a member of stadium staff, even after the angry clash had died down Spahic is pictured taking on Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm for the ball during the DFB-Pokal quarter-final The incident has been referred to the public prosecutor in Cologne and could now be investigated by police.  Spahic will issue an apology for his behaviour. A Bayer spokesman said: 'It is clear that there has been a physical dispute after the final whistle. We will review the incident and try to clarify now who was there and why they were there.'

    "document": "Birmingham is the rat capital of the UK and the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs, according to new research. The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. Scroll down for video A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_ While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland. The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.' Wasp numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years (left) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country (right) The number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in Scotland in the last five years, data showed, with those in Fife most likely to report a problem",

    "document": "A Hollywood-inspired experiment to help dementia patients by waking them up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place in New York. The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'",

    "document": "(CNN)\"A long, long, time ago...\" Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece \"American Pie.\"  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled.  \"Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\"  By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\"   When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when \"American Pie\" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing \"American Pie\" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing \"and they were singing\" everybody spontaneously joins in with the \"Bye, Bye\" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes \"American Pie\" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When \"American Pie\" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like \"Danny Boy\" or \"Streets of Laredo\" or \"Shenandoah,\" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, \"American Pie\" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret \"American Pie,\" it's fair to surmise that \"the king\" is Elvis Presley, \"Helter Skelter\" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the \"jester on the sidelines in a cast\" is Bob Dylan, and \"Jack Flash\" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to \"American Pie.\" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose \"American Pie\" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were \"Over the Rainbow\" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y \"Yip\" Harburg), \"White Christmas \"(by Irving Berlin), \"This Land is Your Land\" (by Woody Guthrie) and \"Respect\" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, \"American Pie\" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.",

The Premier League champions have written to 300 fans who took them up on their offer of free transport for the Bank Holiday evening clash at Selhurst Park. Palace's South London home is notoriously difficult to get to and the club acted after the game was scheduled for an 8pm start, making it impossible for supporters to travel by train. Edin Dzeko and his Manchester City team-mates reflect on their Premier League defeat at Crystal Palace Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany looks dejected after seeing his side slump to defeat in London However, after being sent on their way from the Etihad Stadium at 1.30pm by City legend Mike Summerbee, all of those onboard the six coaches missed the kick-off with some arriving as much as 20 minutes after the start. Some complained that Summerbee's send-off had gone on for too long and was responsible for their late arrival. Now, the club has acknowledged the coaches set off too late and have written to supporters to apologise and advise them that they will be refunding the cost of their match tickets. The letter, seen by Sportsmail, reads: 'The free coach travel was provided to enable supporters to attend this match on a day when return rail travel from Manchester wasn’t an option due to the kick-off time, and the time of the final train back to Manchester. Glenn Murray is mobbed by his Crystal Palace team-mates after he opened the scoring against Man City Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew celebrates with the home fans during their win against Manchester City 'We have liaised with our travel partner and wanted to advise that whilst this was a Bank Holiday, which was factored in to the journey planning, it is accepted that the coaches should have left the Etihad Stadium earlier than they did. 'As a gesture to you and all supporters who travelled on the official coaches, the club will be refunding the money that you paid for your match ticket within the next seven working days. We will contact you if we require any further details to process the refund. 'We would like to apologise for the delayed arrival at Selhurst Park and thank you for your patience and support on the day.' The move is likely to cost the club in the region of £12,000. Things did not get much better for the City fans when they finally arrived for the match as Manuel Pellegrini's side went down 2-1 to all-but-end their hopes of retaining their title.",

    "document": "Economy passengers have long wished they were in first class with lie-flat beds and nice meals, but now it seems there is someone else to envy - the cabin crew. A new plane design has revamped the areas where cabin crew can enjoy from rest and relaxation in flight, and it seems they have more space than any passengers. A slick bunk bed design has been unveiled by Zodiac Galleys Europe, giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut-eye during long-haul flights. Scroll down for video First class accommodation! Zodiac Aerospace have revealed their new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew The lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest Drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents, their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious, private and with maximum personal comfort. Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system. In order to maximise the sense of space, innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented. The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week, which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing. The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests for Airbus A330/A340 since the '90s and is the market leader for this area. Each section boasts a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual  in-flight entertainment systems and air conditioning They aimed to start from a clean slate  in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas, and conducted extensive market research to achieve this. 'The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight, but also to enhance the user experience,' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift. 'In every step of the process users were involved. 'The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests.' Cabin envy! The deluxe areas were created after Zodiac Aerospace spoke to 30 flight attendants from four different continents Last year other rare photographs revealed the tiny space quarters afforded to flight attendants on Boeing 373 Dreamliners. Unlike the Aerospace lower deck areas, the Boeing Crew Rest Departments (CRCs) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane, or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers. Enough room to swing a cat? A file picture reveals the Crew Rest Department on board a Boeing 777 On a Cathay Pacific 777-300ER there is a concealed staircase leading to the CRC at the rear of the plane. Attendants have to duck to get through it, but there is room for eight flight staff with six foot bunk beds with heavy curtains for blocking out noise from other crew members. Instructions state that one crew member can be on a bunk at a time, and never during taxi, take off and landing. When not in use, the secret door must be closed and latched to avoid passengers wandering in. Sleep tight: The cosy and comfortable looking crew sleeping quarters on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Pilots have their own separate sleeping quarters, such as this one, on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Looking out over the passengers: Cabin crew can keep an eye on everyone on the flight in case of any issues",

The friends were on their way to see Les Misérables on Broadway, DNA Info reports, and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a crowded rush-hour 6 train. 'We came here for vacation. We’ve been here one day. We’re no heroes, just tourists,' Makrus Åsberg, a 25-year-old officer with the police Uppsala, Sweden, told the New York Post. 'We're no heroes, just tourists': The Swedish cops (pictured left to right) Erik Näslund, 26, Samuel Kvarzell, 25, Makrus Åsberg, 25, and Eric Jansberger, 28, said they were just answering the call of duty Mr Asberg, along with Erik Naslund, Samuel Kvarzell and Eric Jansberger, subdued an enraged homeless man who was viciously beating another rider on the train. The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports. Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info. 'We don't have authority or anything but we thought somebody might need help,' he said. When NYPD officers showed up, they took custody of the aggressor and the four tourists went on their way to Les Misérables.

    "document": "Alec Stewart has expressed his interest in becoming the new Director of England Cricket following the sacking on Wednesday of Managing Director Paul Downton. Stewart, who played in a record 133 Tests for England and is currently director of cricket at Surrey, has not yet been approached by the ECB. But he said: ‘When England come calling, you shouldn’t say no.’ The early bookies’ favourite for the post is Michael Vaughan, the former England captain who is close to the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, and has also made clear his desire to help English cricket out of its current state of chaos. Alec Stewart stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday Stewart lines up with Surrey players for the team photo at the KIA Oval Test matches: 133 Highest score: 190 Runs: 8463 Centuries: 15 Half-centuries: 45 Batting average: 39.54 Stumpings: 14 First test: West Indies, Kingston, Feb 24, '90 Last test: South Africa, The Oval, Sep 4, '03 Stats via ESPNcricinfo But Stewart, who also spoke highly of the early impression Kevin Pietersen has made on his return to the Surrey team, remains a respected figure in the game. And he is open to offers. Asked whether he’d be interested in the post – created by the ECB’s new chief executive Tom Harrison, who confirmed Downton’s demise Wednesday evening – Stewart said: ‘I can’t just say yes until I know what the role and the responsibility are. But, of course, if it was the right role, you’d be stupid not to look at it. ‘As a player I did just about anything that was asked of me. If they asked me to take on a role, and it’s the right role, of course I’d listen and have a big conversation – once the ECB have asked Surrey permission to speak to me, of course, because I’m under contract here. ‘I just want England to be the best side in the world. And if the ECB felt I was the right person to help take them to No 1, then of course I’d look at it. ‘I’ve got a big job here, and that’s what I’m concentrating on. But at the same time you’ve got to make yourself aware of other opportunities, and when England come calling, you shouldn’t say no. ‘If they want someone with experience of being a director of cricket, then I’d have thought I’d be very close to being at the top of that list.’ Stewart (centre front) poses in the Surrey team photo ahead of the start of the County Championship season Stewart was a wicketkeeper-batsman for England. Here he looks on as Australia's Steve Waugh plays a shot towards England fielder Graham Thorpe in the fifth test of an Ashes clash at Edgbaston in 1993 Stewart is carried by team-mates Steve Harmison (left) and Andrew Flintoff, after playing his final Test match, at the Oval in September 2003 against South Africa But Stewart made clear he’d be interested in the job only if there was a clear definition of his accountability. ‘If you do well, you get patted on the back, if you don’t do well, you get moved on. To me, it’s straightforward. But if there are too many bits and pieces in the jigsaw, people can hide. ‘I’m not one for hiding. It’s about making tough decisions, and living and dying by those decisions. And making sure the players play without fear.’ Stewart, who led England in 15 Tests and scored nearly 8,500 runs, was effusive in his praise of Pietersen, whose chances of a surprise England recall increased from highly unlikely to merely improbable following the sacking of Downton – who in turn had sacked Pietersen over a year ago. Kevin Pietersen will feature for Stewart's Surrey outfit in this year's county championships and the former wicket-keeper batsman believes the 34-year-old could still make a comeback at international level ‘We’ve never had a problem with him,’ said Stewart. ‘I’m sure other dressing-rooms may not say the same, but we don’t have to handle him. ‘He fits in well. When he walked in, he went to his locker straightaway: it was like he’d never been away. We can only speak in glowing terms of him. And that’s how I judge people, is how I find them – not hearsay, or from other people. ‘England have said he’s not on their radar. But you should never say never. If he’s racking the runs up, and England are struggling, if the players aren’t getting runs or there’s an injury to a batsman, and he’s in top form – why wouldn’t you want to bring him back?’",

Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo  claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

    "document": "A spring snowstorm and icy roads caught Colorado drivers by surprise Friday, causing a 39-vehicle pileup near Boulder and other bad wrecks that shut down highways during the morning commute. No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars. Lisa Lai told the Daily Camera newspaper she avoided hitting a crash in front of her and ended up propped against a highway barrier — and out of the way — as other peoples' vehicles piled up. A tow truck driver works to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36, Friday near Boulder, Colo. A car is stuck under a semi tractor trailer at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36 Numerous crashes and spin outs on icy and snowy highways have closed portions of several interstates and highways in the Denver and Colorado Springs area as well as the mountains 'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado. We have four seasons in one day,' Schmidt said after the sun emerged. A tow truck driver works to clear the scene of cleanup on the pileup  on Drivers of damaged cars wait at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars And drought-weary Californians, who can't expect much encouragement from mountains elsewhere in the West: Snow that fills the Colorado River is lagging, too, officials said Friday. The snowpack in the Colorado and Wyoming valleys where the river originates now ranges from 51 to 79 per cent of normal, said Brian Domonkos, Colorado supervisor of the U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey, which monitors snowfall and water availability. The Colorado River supplies water to about 40 million people and 6,300 square miles of farmland in seven states, including California. A driver stands amid vehicles involved in an accident on wrecked cars The Rocky Mountain snow that melts into the river doesn't flow directly to California and other downstream users. Instead, it's held in a series of reservoirs that release enough water to fulfill the legal allotments to southwestern states under a series of agreements and court rulings. The reservoirs have sufficient water to provide California and other downstream states with their full shares this year and for the foreseeable future, said Matthew Allen, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the reservoir system. California also gets water from the Sierra Nevada range, where the snow cover was the lowest it has ever been in 65 years of record-keeping as of Wednesday. Warm temperatures and scarce snowfall in early March caused the snowpack in Colorado to shrink significantly. 'To see the decline that we saw at the beginning of March, that is abnormal,' Domonkos said. 'And to see it continue almost unabated, almost to now, that's quite abnormal.' Emergency personnel and tow truck drivers work to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup A storm brought up to 11 inches of snow on Thursday and Friday to parts of the Colorado mountains and foothills, but much of it fell east of the Continental Divide and will eventually melt into the South Platte and Arkansas rivers. Preliminary readings showed the snowpack on Friday in the South Platte basin was 87 per cent of normal and 79 percent of normal in the Arkansas basin. The U.S. Drought Monitor says 40 per cent of California is in an exceptional drought, the most severe category, and another 25 per cent is in an extreme drought, the second-most severe. A pedestrian moves along a sidewalk while framed by branches covered with snow from a spring storm in Denver A cows grazes as her calves lay next to her on a farm after a light snow, near Eldorado Springs, Colo., not far from a lagging Colorado River Gov. Jerry Brown ordered mandatory, statewide water cutbacks by cities and towns, aiming for a 25 percent cut in water use.

Milder drought conditions extend across the rest of the West, except for most of Montana and Wyoming. Other states served by the Colorado River are Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Nevada.

Twice the teenage winger visited the national stadium to cheer on his boyhood club in 2010 but Villa lost both times, to Manchester United in the League Cup final and Chelsea in the FA Cup final four. Grealish, 19, was handed his first Premier League start by Tim Sherwood in the 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers and is hopeful of retaining his place for the April 19 date. Jack Grealish made his first Premier League start for Aston Villa against QPR on Tuesday night Grealish saw Villa lose twice at Wembley in 2010 - in the League Cup final and in the FA Cup semi-final ‘I went twice to Wembley as a fan, the Man U game and Chelsea game five years ago,’ said Grealish. ‘Unfortunately we didn’t win either of them, hopefully this time we can go and get a result. ‘It would be brilliant to stay in the team for Wembley but at the end of the day the gaffer will pick who he thinks he will win.

You can see what he did at Tottenham with the young lads, bringing them through. Grealish expressed his gratitude towards manager Tim Sherwood for giving him his first start ‘Here he’s brought the younger lads to come and train next to the first team, which is so little but means so much.’ The return to form of Christian Benteke also inspires survival hope. ‘Yes, when you have Christian in the team who can score goals every game,’ Grealish said. ‘We are going to go in Saturday's game (at Tottenham) positive and 100 per cent we will stay up.’",

In comparison, the retired hairdresser, prefers to dress up in kinky outfits and go out drinking until the early hours. Pat, 69, pictured left in her police woman fancy dress outfit, enjoys pole dancing with friend Julia, 67, right 'I really enjoy myself, I party hard,' she admitted on the Channel 5 show OAPs Behaving Badly. 'I have heard of the saying \"grow old gracefully\" but I don't understand it.' Grandmother-of-three Pat lost her husband 12 years ago to prostate cancer after dutifully caring for him during the last nine years of his life following his diagnosis. Now she's focused on enjoying herself and wants to make the most of the time she has left. She said: 'I have cared for people all my life. I don't want to look after someone full-time again, I want to look after me now. 'Whatever time I have left I am going to party and love it till I die.' Pat in another of her risque outfits gets to grips with an Elvis impersonator in Menorca While Pat likes to hit the town at night, during the day she hits the gym and also enjoys pole-dancing lessons. Thanks to keeping fit and active, she says she feels confident about her appearance as she nears 70 and as a result, she is happy to show off her body in a number of 'kinky' outfits. Her wardrobe includes a risque fancy dress police woman look, air hostess and French Maid outfits, as well as a leather jumpsuit, and she teams them all with stilettos. She said: 'I like to dress sexy, if I can't walk in high heels, I won't go outside. I just like to have fun and feel good in whatever I wear. 'For my age I don't have a bad body. I can walk into a room and I still turn heads and I like that.' Pat, pictured again with the Elvis impersonator, loves to party and stay out dancing on tables Far from being embarrassed by their party pensioner grandparent, Pat's family think she's great fun and love it if she joins them on nights out. Her granddaughter, Paris, 20, said: 'She stays out till 1am dancing on the tables, it's not embarrassing, I don't think \"my nanna shouldn't do that\", it's cool.' Pat isn't alone in her desire to party. She has a partner in crime in her friend Julia Church, 67, who now lives in Menorca. Julia, also a retired hairdresser, moved to the Spanish island with her husband and now parties with her fellow British expats following his death seven years ago. Pat regularly visits her and the pair get glammed up for nights out where they drink and dance the night away. Pat on a night out with Julia, left, who says 'we'll just keep going till we fall to bits' The friends often party all night in Menorca where Julia now lives Julia said: 'You can't judge others like us, we're not normal, we're crazy. Being 67 or 27 it doesn't make any difference, we're exactly the same. 'I don't like the thought of getting old, we'll just keep going till we fall to bits. There's no point worrying about it, you'll make yourself depressed.' Pat has been single for years following the death of her husband and said she has dated some younger men - including a man in his 40s who was younger than her 49-year-old son. But now she's found happiness with Colin, 66. She said: 'We have a fantastic time together, we have good sex, we enjoy each others' company. 'I realised how much I missed that, having someone to care for me and protect me and treat me like a lady.' Julia shows off her pole dancing skills. She admits: 'I don't like the thought of getting old' OAPs Behaving Badly is on Channel 5 Wednesdays at 9pm",

    "document": "A youngster has emulated Barcelona star Martin Montoya and scored an audacious 27-yard goal into a basketball hoop - twice. Schoolboy Frankie Franz watched the Spanish right-back pull off the staggering trick shot in a video recorded at Barcelona’s Ciutat Esportiva training ground earlier in the month. The viral clip shows the 23-year-old defender lifting the ball into the net to the sound of gasps from his team mates at the Catalonia club. Joking  that he could do the same with his mum and grandmother, nine-year-old Frankie, who is an academy player with Dagenham and Redbridge Football Club, took to the garden to have a go. He moved the basketball hoop into the middle of the goal and after a little run up sent the ball straight through the net first time. In the video he can be seen turning to face the camera looking absolutely gob-smacked as he places his hands behind his head. A slow motion look at the clip captures the trajectory of the ball, which bounces off the backboard and goes through the hoop below. His mother Lucy, 32, of Upminster, east London, said: ‘He loves football and after he saw the Barcelona player do the show he said ‘I’ll be able to do that’. Frankie decided to have a go at the trick shot after watching Barcelona star Martin Montoya pull it off in a video recorded at the club’s Ciutat Esportiva training ground The nine-year-old kicks the ball and sends it straight through the net on the first time of trying just like Spanish right-back Montoya The gob-smacked youngsters places his hands behind his head after scoring while Montoya (right) wheels away in celebration ‘Me and my mum just said ‘really?’ and he went to get the net, pulled it over and bang - it went in first time. ‘Me and mum were like ‘oh my god’ we couldn’t believe it. ‘He is very good at football, but that was just amazing. It was very special.’ According to Lucy, although not captured on camera, the youngster had another go immediately after and netted again. \"I think he's got it down now,\" said Lucy, who helps run a building firm with husband Matt, 34. \"He is very confident but you can tell by the look on his face I think he was surprised too.\" The talented young centre midfielder has played football since he could walk and dreams of one day turning out for Real Madrid or Barcelona.

We know how to look,\" she said. \"In most cases, we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it. And so I think we're definitely on the road.\" NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa. The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release. \"Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter's moon) Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice,\" the agency noted. There are some caveats involved, of course. NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant; it's referring to microorganisms. \"We are not talking about little green men,\" Stofan said at the panel. \"We are talking about little microbes.\" Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it's an exciting time -- and he thinks it's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well. \"I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star,\" he said. And, he added, who knows what that life will look like? \"Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it's similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low,\" he said. \"And I think that's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting.\"",

    "document": "The woman falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo has been snapped cutting lines of a suspicious-looking white powder. Sarah Watson, 34, had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender at a Christmas party for the team. But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort £100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her £25,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare. Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle. In one, she is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of an unknown white power in Las Vegas. In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight. The 34-year-old had met Rojo at Manchester United's private Christmas party in a Manchester bar. She said the footballer had approached her and complimented her looks and dress. Despite calling his approach 'cheesy', she had decided to give him her phone number. Later that evening Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. 'My love, where are you?' he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's – known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit – made a shocking proposition. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers. She was depicted in court – and in the national press – as a scheming blackmailer who demanded £100,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model And it was on this basis that the player's lawyers obtained a High Court order preventing her from speaking out. ‘People who look after Marcos claimed I had demanded £100,000 to keep quiet about our encounter,’ she said.. ‘But it was a lie and they knew it. They tried to trap me.’ ‘I didn’t set out to do a kiss and tell, but the chance to make some money to pay for my personal training course was very tempting. I’m a single woman and I had not done anything illegal or that I was ashamed of. '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me £100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated £25,000 legal costs. The defender has not spoken about the incident publicly, while his friend Bereit - who Sarah claims offered her the money - declined to comment.",

    "document": "Up to 100 Islamic teachers could be banned from working in schools for life following an investigation into their alleged links to the Trojan Horse scandal. It is understood a teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in Birmingham where extremist Islamic views were being forced on pupils and staff. This includes allegations an al-Qaeda style video featuring masked gunmen was copied in a classroom and teachers punished pupils by making them kneel on tiles. More than 50 teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged as many as 3,000 messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby was a hoax. Scroll down for video Park View School in Birmingham was one of the schools placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism - up to 100 teachers are now being investigated It is understood the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) - the profession's watchdog responsible for banning teachers from classrooms - is looking at 30 disciplinary cases, with an expectation many more teachers will be targeted for their part in the affair. The probe into the Islamic plot last year found evidence of anti-Western rhetoric, intolerance towards gays and creating the perception of a worldwide conspiracy against Muslims. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Allegations under investigation include claims that an al-Qaeda style video was copied at Park View Academy and teachers punished children by making them kneel on the floor, the Sunday Times reports. A group of teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group where they claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby and the Boston bombings, where two bombs were set off at the finish line of the city's marathon, were a hoax. Professional hearings are set to begin next month. More than 50 teachers alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich,  was a hoax In his report, Peter Clarke (pictured) found there had been a 'coordinated, deliberate and sustained action' to introduce an aggressive Islamic ethos in the schools The teaching watchdog has obtained 'dossiers' about some of the 100 staff it is investigating from the Department for Education as part of its inquiries. They are understood to include information from last year's Trojan Horse probe headed by Peter Clarke, the former head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard. His report, published in July, found there had been a 'co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action, carried out by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos into a few schools in Birmingham'. It also highlighted a 'disconcerting pattern' in the schools, including nepotism in staff appointments, bullying of senior teachers, a 'strategy of harassment to oust the head teacher' and the 'reinforcement of Muslim identity to the exclusion or disparagement of others'. A source told the Sunday Times: 'The 100 or so include teachers, teaching assistants and teaching staff. The Department for Education is feeding in information to help corroborate some of what the NCTL has, and, in other cases, flag up new targets.' 'In some cases, some of those teachers and staff are still working at schools, and in other cases they have been removed. 'But although some of them have been removed, the NCTL does not want them to end up anywhere else.' The Trojan Horse scandal started with an anonymous letter in March last year describing an Islamic plot to take over schools in Birmingham called 'Operation Trojan Horse'. The document - now thought to be a hoax - proposed a campaign of installing governors and undermining and then replacing school leaders with staff who would be more sympathetic to their religious agenda. That in turn led to 21 schools being inspected by schools inspector Ofsted, which put six schools in special measures and said five had not done enough to protect children from extremism. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Then in November last year, inspectors found evidence that six independent faith schools in Tower Hamlets, in east London, had an unbalanced curriculum. Several teenage girls have fled to join ISIS in Syria from schools in Tower Hamlets. This Easter, tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed by Tower Hamlets council advising parents to 'lock away' their children's passports if they fear the youngsters may be planning to travel to Syria over the holiday period. Tower Hamlets is the only local authority in London where Muslims account for the largest single religious group. An estimated 35 per cent of the population practise Islam, compared with 4.4 per cent across the country according to the latest census.",

After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The bizarre post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for £5million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements.

    "document": "Odds on the second royal baby being called Sam have been slashed, following the success of Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree, the Duchess' close friend Prince George's brother or sister could be called Sam - after the jockey that helped the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge rekindle their romance. Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25 Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National. In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding. And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin. Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to £10,000. Her team will be led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household. Waley-Cohen is a Celebrity Ambassador for The Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT) and was famously pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge at the Roller Disco he organised to raise money for a ward in memory of his brother.",

    "document": "Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus has revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Speaking in the latest issue of Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former senator and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine Short and sweet: Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose ideology revolves around getting 're-elected at all costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female politicians get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There’s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let’s do something about that,' she said. 'Let’s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that’s OK, and if it does look good, that’s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld. On Tuesday it was announced that she would be making an appearance on her former co-star's Crackle channel web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.",

    "document": "An obese mother who enjoyed takeaways and boozy nights out has lost more than seven stone after a child on a bus pointed at her and asked whether she was pregnant. Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: \"Has she got a baby in her belly?\"' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week.

    "document": "A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, \"Wow!\"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.",

    "document": "(CNN)The last time Frank Jordan spoke with his son, Louis Jordan was fishing on a sailboat a few miles off the South Carolina coast. The next time he spoke with him, more than two months had passed and the younger Jordan was on a German-flagged container ship 200 miles from North Carolina, just rescued from his disabled boat. \"I thought I lost you,\" the relieved father said. Louis Jordan, 37, took his 35-foot sailboat out in late January and hadn't been heard from in 66 days when he was spotted Thursday afternoon by the Houston Express on his ship drifting in the Atlantic Ocean. \"I was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me, and I was grateful to God that my parents were not going to be worried about me,\" Jordan told CNN. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan told CNN. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" The younger Jordan said he took his sailboat out to the Gulf Stream to find some better fishing, when it capsized.  He broke his shoulder when the boat flipped. Because of the injury, Jordan couldn't repair the boat's mast, which had snapped. \"Everything I owned got broken -- all my electronics, my GPS devices,\" Jordan said.  He was dead in the water. Jordan drifted in the Atlantic, rationing food and water until his shoulder healed. He was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, Jordan said, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" he said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned that they were attracted to his laundry that he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jodran came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital at about 7:30 p.m. Jordan was reported missing January 29, a few days after his last contact with his father. Two months of concern poured out in a phone call with his son's rescuers. Frank Jordan thanked the captain of the Houston Express. \"You're a good man, I swear.  You did what you are supposed to do, and I sure do appreciate it,\" he says. \"And I know my son appreciates it.\" CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.",

The child was rescued by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. Scroll down for video A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5.

    "document": "Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table looking at a range of living standards. Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings. With figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese, Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure. Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world. Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table, put together by a Harvard Business School academic, looking at a range of living standards Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world Despite national earnings that make us the world’s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a ‘social progress index’ suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers – for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: ‘Overall, within Europe the UK’s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world’s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) ‘The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK’s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.’ The table – which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world – lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd. For Press freedom, the UK is ranked 27th. Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, who headed the research, said: ‘A striking finding is that gross domestic product is far from being the sole determinant of social progress.’",

Ben Elton took a swipe at Myleene Klass over her criticism of Ed Miliband's mansion tax plans, at the event also attended by Eddie Izzard, Joey Essex and Sally Lindsay. The comedian told a 1,000-strong crowd at Warrington's Parr Hall the popstar - who claimed the planned levy on homes worth more than £2 million would hit 'little grannies' - had made her money 'showering in a bikini' and should be 'proud to make a contribution'. Elton, who distanced himself from the party under Tony Blair, told supporters he was 'back with Labour'. He said: 'It's no secret that I am now one of that wealthy minority. Me and Myleene Klass. Scroll down for video Comedian Ben Elton, left, took a swipe at Myleene Klass, right, during a rally for Labour supporters The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex posed for a selfie with a fan during rally in Warrington 'I made my money cracking knob gags, she made her money showering in a bikini. 'We should both be proud to make our contribution.' Elton lashed out at the glitzy Black and White fundraising ball staged annually by the Conservatives to raise funds. 'Apparently we are the ones that sneer. Really? Have you seen the Black and White ball? 'Just a little bit of sneering going on I think.' Long-time Labour supporter Eddie Izzard said the party would offer a 'fair chance for everyone'. Actress Sally Lindsay told the crowd 'it makes me sick' that people are having to turn to foodbanks because they cannot afford to eat. The former Coronation Street star backed Labour's plans to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts and called for a 'decent minimum' wage. Coronation Street actress Sally Lindsay joined Justine Miliband and Eddie Izzard at the campaign event Joey Essex was among the crowd at the rally where Ed Miliband announced a £5 billion Future Homes Fund 'That's why I'm voting Labour, that's why I support Ed.' Martin Freeman, one of Britain's most bankable Hollywood stars, was the first celebrity face to back Labour's 2015 General Election campaign. Joey Essex, who posed for selfies with excited fans, was attending the event ahead of interviewing all the party leaders for a TV special. At the rally in Warrington, Ed Miliband told supporters a Labour government would 'get Britain building again'. Announcing a £5 billion Future Homes Fund, he said Labour would build 125,000 new homes. In a speech, he said: 'There's nothing more British than the dream of home ownership. Starting out in a place of your own. But for so many young people today that dream is fading.' He went on: 'Our plan is the first real plan for housebuilding in a generation. 'We will build at least 200,000 homes a year by the end of the Parliament. 'We won't let those large developers just hoard land. 'Waiting for it to go up in value when it could be used to build homes. 'We'll say: either you use the land or you lose the land. 'We will build a new generation of towns, garden cities and suburbs creating over half a million new homes. Ed Miliband, speaking at the rally,  said a Labour government would 'get Britain building again' 'We will make housing the top priority for additional capital investment.' Mr Miliband added: 'The banks will benefit from the taxpayer support we will provide to help people save for their first home. 'In return, we will expect the banks to invest in homes for the next generation. Unlocking £5 billion for 125,000 homes. 'A Labour government will get Britain building again.'",

    "document": "A Saudi Arabian man has been arrested at the Mexican border after attempting to flee the country to avoid facing rape charges in Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state – let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah – especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later. Alshammari's attorney Ron Yengich declined to comment on Tuesday, saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest. When asked about Alshammari's connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege. Police did not offer details about the royal connection, besides saying that federal officials reported Alshammari is related to royalty and has family connections to the Saudi Arabian government.",

    "document": "Every country in the world may have its rich kids of Instagram, but in Mexico the increasingly ostentatious displays of wealth by the young elite is taking on a political dimension. In a country where a significant majority of citizens live in poverty, the self-styled Mirreyes (my kings), with their champagne and sports cars, are increasingly exposing the amount of wealth concentrated into a relatively small number of hands. Mirreyes, which refers to individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' and are 'placed above all others', post pictures of luxuries with a hashtag of the same name. Scroll down for video Ballers and shotcallers: Mirreyes are often the sons and daughters of the members of Mexican high society Laying out and living it up: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes showcase luxurious vacation spots It's just one big fiesta: A glance through the social media profile of a Mirrey often reveals a party picture Bling: Good clothes, nice watches and a flashy style are almost prerequisites for becoming one of the Mirreyes Ready for takeoff: An expert on the subject of Mirreyes said 'the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts' Three for the money: Mirreyes' displays of wealth can  lead to political and legal advantages down the road They are often the sons and daughters of government officials, wealthy businessman and other members of Mexican high society and although their displays of wealth can be embarrassing, they can also lead to political and legal advantages, Maclean's reported. One such individual, the eldest son of then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a cruise ship off the coast of Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and vanished without a trace, Before he jumped off the ship's 15th floor and disappeared beneath the waves, 29-year-old Jorge Alberto López Amores told his friends to take cellphone videos of his leap. He said: 'I'll stop this cruise, I'll make history.' López got his wish as the boat stopped for two hours to search for him, according to Vivelo Hoy. His story is not the only example of the celebration of excess gone wrong. In 2012, the daughter of oil workers' union boss Carlos Romero Deschamps was brought into the spotlight for posting photos of her luxury lifestyle, including Gucci bags and expensive wine, on Facebook. Her flashy pictures did not sit well in a country where people work an average of 2 226 hours a year and households take in an average of $12,850 per year after taxes. Their stories are just examples of what the author of a book about Mirreyes called the Mexican 'Generation Me'. Keeping time: People often post pictures of watches and other luxuries like designer bags and or alcohol Rought: In Mexico, the images of wealth are shocking as households take in an average of $12,850 per year Symbol: Jorge Alberto López Amores (right), who likely died after jumping off a boat, is an example of a Mirrey Purchasing power: Mirreyes might not even think twice about spending hundreds of dollars on a stuffed bear Selfie star: López, the son of then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a yacht in 2014 No need to pimp my ride: Mirreyes obtain cash from sources like inheritance, theft, corruption or the lottery Kiss the bling: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes will either have a shiny watch, fancy champagne, or both The author of Mirreynato, the Other Inequality, Ricardo Raphael, wrote in his book: 'The economic wealth Mirreyes use is the main marker of class. 'No matter where the money comes - work, inheritance, theft, corruption or lottery- the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts'. By identifying themselves as Mirreyes on social media, these seemingly spoiled brats are possibly creating connections which could be important for business and politics in the future because money attracts powerful friends. They are certainly being noticed. In 2011, a  a website called Mirrreybook was created by Pepe Ceballos. He began posting photos of mMirreyes on the site and it quickly became popular. Ceballos said: 'Mirreyes, who don't have anything to do with narcos [narcotics traffickers], seem like they're competing with them to see who has more. 'We've suddenly seen it in the kind of fashion or the bling-bling. There's more influence from the narcos.' In a recent source of embarrassment, Mirreyes were also featured in a controversial video that showcased the class of 2015 from private school Instituto Cumbres in Mexico City. In the professionally-produced video, well-dressed male students were shown drinking alcohol while carrying out a casting call with young women who dance, strip and wash their feet. Popping bottles: Mirreyes are individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' The flash and the not-so-furious: Members of this select group seem to have few reasons to be upset with life Up in smoke: Some Mirreyes post photos implying they have something in common with narcotics traffickers Look at me: The selfie has become somewhat of a status symbol and Mirreyes frequently use them to show off Future endeavors: By identifying themselves on social media, Mirreyes are possibly creating good connections The all-male  Catholic school was accused of sexism and promoting privilege after the video began to spread across the internet, according to the National Catholic Reporter. The school issued an apology late last month. It said: 'The Cumbres Institute Mexico asks for an apology for the content of the video that offended various persons, who have expressed anger. 'This video in no way represents the values and principles of the school, students, families and graduates. ''The necessary measures are being taken with the students involved and to establish rules so that it does not occur again.' Permanent vacation It seems Mirreyes travel frequently to foreign destinations judging by the photos they post Power: Mirreyes could be important for business and politics in the future because cash attracts friends Ouch: Pics of Mirreyes relaxing don't sit well in a country where people work an average of 2 226 hours a year",

    "document": "Michael Vaughan has confirmed that he has held talks with the ECB over becoming England’s new supremo as the governing body’s new regime move closer to replacing Paul Downton. The 2005 Ashes winning captain is the hot favourite on the three-man shortlist compiled by the ECB at Thursday’s management board meeting ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart, who have both registered their interest. Vaughan spoke with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison for an hour and has worked closely in the past with chairman-elect Colin Graves at Yorkshire and looks set to be offered the job if he can reach agreement. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket Vaughan spoke to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No 1 choice Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday ‘I had a good chat with Tom which was just about general stuff,’ said Vaughan. ‘We had a one-hour conversation. I have not got a clue what the role is, what the parameters are or what they are looking for. ‘It was the first time I have met him since he was made chief executive because I’ve been away at the World Cup. I knew him from his IMG days and back in the day when he played for Derbyshire but we had not met in person for a long time,’ Vaughan told the Daily Telegraph. ‘It was just a chance to meet up and have a chat and try to kick around a few ideas. It was away from England stuff. It was about the game, the structure and Twenty20. Everything. ‘I like the way he works and his vision for the game and he and Colin Graves will be the perfect partnership. But nothing has changed as far as I’m concerned. I am keen to talk to them when I understand more about the role and what skills are required. 'There will be many others, really good guys, keen to talk who are the type of guys needed to move English cricket forward. ‘I am certainly not in a position to be anywhere near being appointed because I don’t know what the job is. Until we know what it entails I, like all the other candidates, have to look at it and see whether it is for me.’ Former England stars Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role That may be so but the ECB are keen to make a quick appointment and Vaughan looks certain to be the one they want to effectively become a football manager type figure with overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Peter Moores, who is preparing to coach England in their Test series here in the Caribbean, said on Thursday he could work with Vaughan even though the pair had an uneasy relationship when they were captain and coach in 2007. Vaughan has also been a strong critic of Moores in his second coming as coach in his various media roles and it is the amount of successful interests Vaughan has that remain the biggest obstacles towards his appointment. ‘I am loving my job at the moment,’ said Vaughan. ‘I really enjoy the media work and I am now looking forward to getting to the West Indies to watch England win a series they should win and continue where they left off in Test cricket against India last year.’ It will be fascinating to watch Vaughan commentate for BBC’s Test Match Special on a team he may well soon be in charge of. England coach Peter Moores has said he could work with Vaughan despite their uneasy relationship Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket Alec Stewart (Age 52) CURRENT JOB: Director of cricket at Surrey. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Played 133 Tests, more than any England cricketer. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Has established a rapport at Surrey with the out-of-favour Kevin Pietersen — says English cricket needs to be bold. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He’s only interested if there’s a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Andrew Strauss (Age 38) CURRENT JOB: Sky commentator. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Widely respected within English cricket for taking the team to the top of the Test rankings. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: Strauss is still in the early days of his career as a commentator – and is enjoying it. Michael Vaughan (Age 40) CURRENT JOB: Broadcaster and columnist. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Famously led England to the 2005 Ashes — and 26 Test wins overall, a national record. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Joe Root is a particular favourite — he is next in line to replace Alastair Cook as Test captain. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Vaughan is interested in the job in principle, and is close to incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He may decide he’s enjoying his media career too much to risk entering firing line.",

    "document": "When Utah photographer Alan Lawrence learned that his newborn son, Wil, had Down Syndrome his 'mind was flooded with many emotions, most of which were not positive.' Now, 18 months later, Lawrence tells ABC that little Wil 'brings a light to our family.' He said he once believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish. Instead, Lawrence said, little Wil has taken the limits off and 'opened so many doors' for his family In return, the father of five has taken the limits off the child and given him a one-of-a-kind ability. The ability to fly. Scroll down for video 'Wil Can Fly:' A Utah photographer, Alan Lawrence (left), created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, Wil (right), who has Down Syndrome appears to be flying The father created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly' in which the toddler appears to be flying in many different scenes. Lawrence, who began taking the photos when Wil was just months old, created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and later cropping himself out. He posted the photos on his blog -- That Dad Blog -- and later on his Instagram account. After receiving positive feedback, Lawrence decided to compile the photos in a calendar and plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down Syndrome foundations, KSL reports. The family recently started a Kickstarter campaign 'When Wil was little, he would lie on his stomach and raise his arms and legs like he was flying. It wasn't something any of my other kids did,' Lawrence told ABC. 'We all said, 'Look, he's flying!' Lawrence said his goal is to raise awareness about Down Syndrome. He admitted in his blog that he and his wife Nikki knew very little about the disorder when Wil was born in October 2013. The father said he hopes to photograph Wil 'flying' in other destinations to raise more awareness. He also told ABC he hopes to help people overseas who do not have access to the same level of care through his YouTube channel by posting therapy tutorials.

    "document": "An argument between two Brisbane neighbours over noise levels has ended in tragedy with one man dead and another charged with manslaughter. Leon Yeaman, 55, was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip Pama, 28, during a row in front of their north Brisbane homes. Mr Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller Road making a lot of noise at around 9pm Thursday night. Phillip Pama covered his face as he left Brisbane Magistrate Courts where he was granted conditional bail on Friday Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr Yeaman was making a commotion. Pama’s defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music and yelling at ‘the world at large’. Pama then confronted Mr Yeaman and it was at that point the situation escalated. Mr Peters said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out ‘blindly’. ‘He was being pushed at the same time he was throwing the punch,’ Mr Peters revealed during a bail application for Pama. ‘He didn't see it connect but he felt it connect.’ The father of three allegedly killed his 55-year-old neighbour with one punch after he refused to turn his music down Paramedics were unable to revive Mr Yeaman who was pronounced dead at the scene at around 11pm on Thursday night. Neighbours described Mr Yeaman as king and generous while his friend John Fisher told ABC Radio he was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music. Pama shielded his face from reporters outside Brisbane Magistrate Courts when he was granted bail on Friday. The Samoan man was ordered to surrender his passport, aherre to a curfew from 6pm to 2am and will have to report to the local police station twice a week. Pama, who has no history of violence, was reportedly ‘beside himself’ with grief. The case is due to return to court on May 18.",

    "document": "Although Hillary Clinton boasts a robust 3.6 million Twitter followers, not even a vast right-wing conspiracy would be able to interact with 2 million of them. According to two popular online measuring tools, no more than 44 per cent of her Twitter fan base consists of real people who are active in using the social media platform. And at least 15 per cent – more than 544,000 – are completely fake. StatusPeople.com, the oldest publicly available Twitter-auditing tool, reports that 44 per cent of the former secretary of state's followers are 'good'; 15 per cent are 'fake'; and 41 per cent are 'inactive,' meaning that they never tweet or reply to any tweets. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO FAKERS: According to one popular online audit tool, only 44 per cent of Hillary Clinton's Twitter followers are real people who participate on the social media platform 'I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT': Clinton has cast herself as a champion of 'everyday Americans' Another Twitter sleuthing website sampled more than 320,000 of Clinton's followers and found that a much larger number of them were 'fake' Just 4 per cent of President Barack Obama's Twitter followers, by comparison, are considered fake. The White House worked overtime to purge most of them after a September 2013 report found that more than half of his followers didn't really exist. Michelle Obama's Twitter audience is 25 per cent fake, according to StatusPeople, along with 21 per cent of Vice President Joe Biden's. Another tool, TwitterAudit.com, sampled 320,000 of Mrs. Clinton's followers and found that 18 per cent were fake. The new measurements will add to the Clinton presidential campaign's embarrassment following news on Tuesday that a large number of her Facebook fans may represent 'likes' that were purchased rather than earned. REALLY? Hillary Clinton's Twitter follower-count appears to be significantly inflated FACEBOOK FAKERY: Clinton boasts two-thirds of a million Facebook 'likes,' but more than 46,000 of them list 'Baghdad' as their hometown Vocativ reported that at least 7 per cent of them listed Baghdad, Iraq as their hometown, a larger number than any U.S. city. That would represent more than 46,000 people. Additional evidence of digital astroturfing is that while most of her U.S. Facebook fans are older than 55, most of the Baghdad contingent is in the 18-34 age range. While Clinton was America's top diplomat, her State Department was buying Facebook 'likes,' according to an Associated Press report from last year. 'In 2013, the State Department, which has more than 400,000 likes and was recently most popular in Cairo, said it would stop buying Facebook fans after its inspector general criticized the agency for spending $630,000 to boost the numbers,' the wire service reported. Clinton left the agency while the inspector general was investigating. ASTROTURF? A woman cast as a kindly, gardening grandma in Clinton's campaign launch video is actually a former abortion lobbyist who once helmed a campaign for Texas state Senator Wendy Davis WHERE'S SCOOBY? Clinton's caravan was spotted in Maumee, Ohio on Monday when she lunched at Chipotle, but no one recognized her Facebook says it has entire teams of employees tasked with rooting out schemes to artificially boost statistics. 'When we catch fraudulent activity, we work to counter and prevent it – including blocking accounts and removing fake likes,' the company reports on its website. Clinton is in Monticello, Iowa on Tuesday for the first stop on her nascent presidential 'listening' tour. She was driven from New York in a van that her campaign aides have dubbed 'Scooby,' after the 'Mystery Machine' van in the Scooby-Doo cartoon series. Daily Mail Online visited Kirkwood Community College on Monday, the site of the event, and heard from students that the former first lady is a 'control freak' who may be pursuing legal status for illegal immigrants because the Democratic Party needs a new pool of loyal voters.",

    "document": "Jonjo O'Neill hosted a media stable visit on Thursday at his Jackdaws Castle yard in Gloucestershire and said he could not be happier with favourite for the Crabbie's Grand National, Shutthefrontdoor. He trains Shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy, the record-breaking Jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys' championship and retire. McCoy has not decided yet whether he is riding Shutthefrontdoor in the £1million Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on  April 11, but everything points to him doing so. Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey AP McCoy rides Shutthefrontdoor to Grand National success later this month O'Neill told Betfred: 'Shutthefrontdoor is in great form. I could not be happier with him. I would have liked to have got a run into him (before the Grand National) but he had an abscess on his sinus in January/February time which took a while to find out where it was. 'We did think about giving him at run at Cheltenham (at the Festival in March) but decided not to. I think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly I did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he wasn't as well as he is now. He is schooling well and is spot on. 'He is a clean-winded horse, who is not hard to get ready. He was ready to run and win first time out at Carlisle. He is going to Aintree fresh and well. It is all down to AP now if he is going ride him. 'You need to have a good classy horse for the National. Before, you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck, now it is a proper race. Aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class. 'He likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan. If he got luck in running over the first mile, I would ride him myself. 'I don't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - I am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at Stratford or whatever! This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11). 'Holywell will run in the Betfred Bowl (April 9) after a great run (fourth) in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit. He put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home. 'He came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [Wednesday] morning. He came alive there last year and seems to like the track.'",

    "document": "The family of murdered Australian baseball player Chris Lane broke down in court as they listened to an emergency call revealing the distressing final moments of his life. The 22-year-old, from Melbourne, was jogging along a street in the rural southern Oklahoma city of Duncan in August 2013, when he was shot in the back with a .22 calibre handgun. His parents, Donna and Peter Lane listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency phone call made by Oklahoma resident who witnessed their son collapsed on the side of the road. Chancey Luna, 17, was charged with  first-degree murder. The teen was riding in a Ford Focus with two teenage friends when he allegedly pulled the trigger as the vehicle drove past. Scroll down for video Family and friends, along with his then girlfriend Sarah Harper (right) broke down as they listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency call made by witnesses who tried to save Chris Lane's (left) life Joy Smith: He's turning blue. 9-11 dispatch: Is he talking to you right now? Joy Smith: No he's [gasping noise], that's all he's doing, making that noise. 9-11: All right, you just stay on the line with me, OK? Joy Smith: If you don't hurry, he's gone. 9-11: Ma'am, they're coming OK, I can't make them come any faster. Joy Smith: Oh my gosh how long's it going to be? He's stopped breathing. Mr Lane, who was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University, was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was randomly gunned down. Family and friends, including Mr Lane's former girlfriend Sarah Harper, heard details about how two bystanders tried to resuscitate the young man who had stopped breathing and wept during the proceedings at the Duncan's District Court on Wednesday. Members of the family broke into loud, uncontrolled sobs when authorities showed the white baseball cap Lane wore when he was shot and photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue. Linda Prior cried as she told court how she attempted to shut Lane's 'big brown eyes' but wasn't able to after failing to resuscitate him. 'The big brown eyes were just staring at me,' Ms Prior, who has first aid training and performed CPR, told the court.

Another local, Richard Rhoades, who also tried to help Lane, said he took off his shirt to place it over Lane's face when they realised he was dead. 'I just thought it would be nice to close his eyes,' he said. Luna's lawyer, Jim Berry, made a shock admission in court on Tuesday that his client had fired the bullet that killed Lane but added the teen was 'reckless' and was only trying to 'scare the jogger'. The lawyer told the jury that for Luna to be found guilty of first degree murder, the prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt the murder was premeditated. Prosecutors said Luna internationally pulled the trigger. The trial continues.

Authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself somewhere inside after ramming the front gates. However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street. Now police believe the suspect, only described as a man in his 30s or 40s, may even be tied to another shooting that occurred Thursday in the Southeast quadrant of the city. Scroll down for video Critical: A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau was shot and critically wounded outside its headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Shooter: Heavily armed tactical teams swarmed to the campus amid reports the shooter had barricaded himself inside 'This started and ended in D.C.,' an FBI source told WUSA. The shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once, according to reports. The campus, built in 2006 and employing thousands, was locked down until about 9pm as authorities unsure where the shooter had gone quickly swarmed. According to the Associated Press, the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car. He went to investigate and it cost him his life. Sharp shooters positioned themselves outside the campus as authorities sought to determine where the shooter had fled Reports: Reports from the scene indicated that loud bangs rang out inside the campus around 8pm, but it wasn't immediately clear if they came from guns or, perhaps, from police 'flash-bang' grenades used to disorient suspects The guard died before 10pm after he was taken to a Washington area hospital, NBC reported. But the gunman trail of violence continued back into DC. Witnesses say some 40 cruisers finally boxed the shooter's green Honda in at 11th and H Streets in Northeast D.C. The barricade caused a collision between the suspect's car and a police cruiser, NBC reports. The suspect was shot several times. Two police officers were also wounded in the showdown, but reportedly had non-life threatening injuries.",

    "document": "A university undergraduate has claimed that the cost of trying to study in London left her with no other choice than to turn to prostitution. As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than £1,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work– even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman – who asked to remain anonymous – spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her. She said: 'I started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs: in a coffee shop, a pub and as a waitress. None paid enough. 'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.' She added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially. 'I had trouble keeping up with course work, especially if I worked evenings. 'For example at the pub, I'd earn £7 an hour for an eight hour shift, two nights a week, so I'd bring home about £100 weekly. 'I'd just moved to London from the north of England. My family are not well off, so cannot afford to help me much. The student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in London 'I didn't know anyone in London so when I moved here it was starting from scratch.' Initially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better. 'It was an overcrowded, noisy flat with other students,' she said of her halls. She moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services. 'I could afford a place of my own. I advertise through a website and have regular clients. 'I visit them at home, in hotels and occasionally at their workplace.' Despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies. 'It is flexible and fits around my course. 'I can work the hours I want to and scale back around exam time or if I have extra course work.' The woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money. 'In my first year at university I started hearing about students turning to sex work,' she said. 'After a time I met someone on another course who'd been working as a stripper in a bar. 'Through her I met another student doing escorting, she clued me in, said where to advertise, and how to avoid bad clients and work safely. 'She gave me the English Collective of Prostitutes' Rights sheet which tells about the laws and how they work. Although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in London the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work. 'My biggest worry is about being arrested because if I get a criminal record it would stay with me for life. It would be massive obstacle to getting other jobs.' However she remains adamant that this is the best option for her after seeing other friends trying alternative routes. 'Sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work I know of. 'Friends at university are working 10 hour shifts for under the minimum wage. Others are working on zero hour contracts and never know how many hours they will get. 'Sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills. 'I know students who've dropped out and left courses due to financial pressures.' However she is well aware of the risks she is taking and says she takes appropriate precautions to avoid being found out. 'Mostly students doing sex work don't talk about it. If it comes out, it could affect your future and job prospects.' The student's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities: 'Since I started escorting I've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent. 'Another woman I know worked as a part time sex worker to earn enough to travel home to visit her family. 'Sex work among students is much more common than people think, and it is likely to increase as long as fees, rent and the cost of living is so high.'",

Billy Thompson was last seen on Saturday at Sugar Bear's home in McIntyre, Georgia, where Mama June's daughter Jessica was preparing to go to prom. Since then Billy hasn't been seen and he isn't returning any phone calls or texts. Scroll down for video Reality star 'Mama' June Shannon and her estranged husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson have filed a missing persons report after his older brother disappeared three days ago Billy Thompson, center, was last seen on Saturday at Sugar Bear's home in McIntyre, Georgia, where Mama June's daughter Jessica was preparing to go to prom The family have filed a report with the local police department and are especially worried because Billy has been struggling to find work and recently suffered a difficult split from the mother of his children, reports TMZ. The family's popular reality show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, was cancelled by TLC after photos emerged of Shannon spending time with convicted child molester Mark McDaniel. June's oldest daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, has accused McDaniel of repeatedly abusing her when she was just a child. In the wake of the cancellation, Thompson's younger brother - Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson – revealed to The National Enquirer  that Shannon had indulged in a 'threesome' with Sugar Bear and older brother Billy back in 2007. 'June said all of the kids were out of the house and Billy came over to visit them,' Uncle Poodle told the Enquirer in December. 'Billy happened to see her in her undergarments. He then told June, \"If you are dressed like that when I get back, I'm going to have sex with you.\"' Billy, pictured with June's daughter Jessica on the day of Mama June and Sugar Bear's wedding in May 2013 hasn't been seen since April 11 and isn't returning phone calls or texts Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson, above, claimed in December that Mama June had enjoyed a 'threesome' with Sugar Bear and his older brother Billy Poodle then says that when Billy came back June was 'naked in bed and they ended up having a threesome.' When asked about the incident, Billy said he 'couldn't remember.' In the wake of the Enquirer's revelation, Poodle posted a text message exchange he had with June in which she reportedly told him; 'IM GOING TO CONFRONT EVERYONE ON EVERYTHING BCYES YOU HAVE STARTED SOME LIES.' She then reportedly wrote; 'OH AND YEAH YOUR FAKE DATE WITH NATIONAL ENQUIOR WHEN YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT ME BILLY AND SUGAR BEAR IT'S OKAY BC THAT IS MY PAST.' Mama June didn't respond officially to the claims, and Uncle Poodle refused to back down. 'I would be more than happy to take another polygraph test (based) on what June told me,' he said. 'If she denies it.'",

    "document": "Dundee have vowed to stand by Paul McGowan after the bad boy midfielder was spared jail for a third assault on a policeman. But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night – before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Travolta told the Tampa Bay Times that he has not seen the documentary, \"and I don't really care to.\" \"I've been so happy with my (Scientology) experience in the last 40 years that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative,\" Travolta said. The actor, one of the Church of Scientology's most high-profile members along with stars like Tom Cruise and Kirstie Alley, is premiering his new film, \"The Forger,\" in Clearwater, Florida. The HBO documentary is based on the book \"Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief\" by Lawrence Wright and is critical of the organization, which has close ties to the showbiz industry. Travolta said he believed the doc was a result of \"people who were disgruntled with their experiences\" with the Church of Scientology, which he touted as a positive experience for him. \"I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?\" Travolta asked. \"It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom (Cruise), I imagine.\" He called Scientology \"brilliant\" and credited the church with helping him to survive the death of his teen son, Jett, after a seizure while the family was on vacation in the Bahamas in 2009. \"Oh, my God, I wouldn't have made it,\" said Travolta, whose wife, Kelly Preston, is also a member. \"Honestly.\"",

Hamilton was relaxed. Vettel was downcast, but said that the race may be a different story from qualifying. Hamilton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently, perhaps heeding the advice of Niki Lauda, his team chairman, who told him via Sportsmail to ‘sort himself out’. McLaren will be towards the back of the grid. Jenson Button will start 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the two former champions. A naturally disappointed Button said: 'The car didn't feel bad so it's interesting when you find a good balance but the lap time is not there. We've made good improvements this weekend, but qualifying just wasn't for us. 'Hopefully we'll be racing the cars in front tomorrow, but we hoped to be competing with them in qualifying as well.' Sebastian Vettel qualified third but could threaten Hamilton's supremacy with the Ferrari stronger than Mercedes over a long run Rosberg waves to the crowd after qualifying on the front row, but the German was clearly frustrated to have missed out on pole position Hamilton's impressive lap on his first run on Q3 was enough to claim his third successive pole at the Chinese Grand Prix Vettel starts ahead of Williams pair Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, with Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen down in sixth place as he struggled in Q3, with his best lap in Q2. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was seventh quickest ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, with Sauber pair Felipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson performing superbly to claim ninth and 10th. Pastor Maldonado lines up 11th, missing out on a place in the top 10 by seven thousandths of a second, with Daniil Kvyat a surprisingly lowly and disappointing 12th in his Red Bull.

    "document": "Barry Beavis, 48, lost his case at the Court of Appeal Millions of motorists face spiralling parking fines after judges ruled yesterday that £85 was not an 'excessively high' penalty for staying too long in a car park. Barry Beavis launched a legal bid to overturn his fine, saying it was unfair, disproportionate and unenforceable. But in a landmark ruling, appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither 'extravagant or unconscionable'. Motoring groups reacted in fury to the decision, accusing the judges – who are thought to earn more than £200,000 a year – of being 'out of touch'. Mr Beavis, from Chelmsford, Essex, had gone to court to fight what he called the 'bullying and threatening' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces. The 48-year-old, who runs a fish and chip shop, got the £85 fine in April 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the Riverside Retail park in Chelmsford. The car park, run by parking firm ParkingEye Ltd, allowed two hours of free parking, but Mr Beavis stayed for three. He claimed the £85 charge against him was disproportionate and vowed to fight the companies who 'extort money by threatening and bullying people into paying up'. But yesterday judges said the fine was enforceable because it was not 'excessively high'. Mr Beavis said he was 'absolutely furious' and planned to appeal. Meanwhile motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys and would open the floodgates for unscrupulous profit-hungry firms 'falling over themselves' to ramp up the already hefty penalties they impose. Ian Taylor, of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'I think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think £85 isn't extravagant. 'An £85 penalty may not seem much to a rich lawyer – it's probably less than many charge for an hour. But for the average hard-pressed motorist trying to make ends meet, it's a very heavy and unfair burden.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said the ruling would hand parking firms a 'blank cheque' to milk drivers, adding: 'This decision could cost motorists millions. 'If judges believe £85 is not an extravagant amount then what is? £100? £200? Our fear is that parking firms will now be falling over themselves to raise their penalty charges and punish drivers.' Mr Beavis had parked his car at the Riverside Retail Park in Chelmsford, pictured above, on April 15, 2013, The retail site, pictured above, offers two free hours of parking and Mr Beavis was fined after he returned 56 minutes late Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said: 'We are concerned that this decision waters down the law on penalty charges and may encourage excessive default charges.' And AA president Edmund King said: 'Britain's motorists really will think judges are out of touch with everyday life if they consider £85 to be a reasonable amount of money for a parking penalty. £85 may not seem much to highly paid lawyers but it represents a great deal of money to cash-strapped motorists.' He added: 'This is a licence to print money for people who have now been handed an open cheque-book and invited to make up the figures as they like.' Speaking outside of the Court of Appeal Mr Beavis said he would now be taking the case to the Supreme Court Parking trap: Many motorists face steep fines for running a few minutes over their allotted time The three judges who unanimously dismissed the challenge – Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lord Justice Patten and Sir Timothy Lloyd – are all thought to earn around £202,000 a year. Yesterday ParkingEye welcomed the judgment, saying it gave 'clarity to motorists and the parking industry' and 'further confirms that our parking charges are fair, reasonable and legally enforceable'. But speaking outside court, Mr Beavis said: 'These firms are not run on a moral basis, they're only out to make as much money as they can, to profiteer from unsuspecting motorists. I am utterly furious and will continue the fight.' Mr Beavis's action comes after the Daily Mail revealed how rogue firms are making millions of pounds from fines handed to motorists who overstay – sometimes for only a few minutes – in car parks at hospitals, railway stations and shopping centres. Cancer sufferers and patients whose treatments have over-run are among those who have been ripped off by the parking firms. Three judges unanimously dismissed his challenge at the Court of Appeal, saying the amount he was charged 'is not extravagant or unconscionable'.",

    "document": "Gordon Brown has warned that the Scottish nationalists want an SNP vote in the General Election to force a second referendum on independence. The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion'. But that her party want 'chaos and constitutional crisis' at Westminster to force another independence referendum. Scroll down for video Gordon Brown, pictured campaigning this week, has warned that the SNP want to use the chaos after the election to force another referendum on Scottish independence and urged 'patriotic Scots' to vote Labour And he warned that those casting their vote on May 7 will be deciding the future of Scotland for the next few years. Mr Brown was speaking during a joint event with local Labour candidate and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander at Elderslie Village Hall in Renfrewshire. He said: 'There is an SNP candidate in this constituency. She says vote SNP, get SNP MPs at Westminster and we will twist their arms and get another referendum. 'Remember what the SNP used to say - the referendum was once in a generation, then it changed a little to once in a lifetime, then it was once every 15 years and now when you ask Ms Sturgeon about this her answers are all evasion. She cannot give a straight answer to the question. 'But does not the SNP candidate in this constituency tell the truth, that what they want is an SNP vote not to deliver social justice but to deliver the chaos and constitutional crisis at Westminster to as she said force a second referendum. 'And I say I don't want the divisiveness, I don't want the bitterness, I don't want the acrimony, I don't want the divisions between families and communities in the next few months that we had in the past few months.' The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion' Mr Brown urged people to vote Labour to end the bedroom tax, food bank poverty, zero-hours contracts and the neglect of the NHS. He added: 'When you vote on May 7 remember that you are not just voting to end Tory austerity and the possibility of five more years of the bedroom tax and everything else, you're also voting on whether you are going to allow the SNP to use your vote to try to force a second referendum on this country within a few months or after the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.' He also said that Labour will hold an economic summit immediately after the General Election to boost jobs, expand city deals, encourage investment and provide jobs and training for young people. Mr Brown also urged people to be 'proud patriotic Scots' and back Labour's plan for full employment in Scotland. He said: 'Patriotism means, yes, supporting a strong Scottish parliament, but it doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation across the whole country that can deliver us full employment and more jobs. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the money that comes from the bankers' bonus tax that will allow Scottish young people to have jobs in the future. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation on research and innovation that will replace the Linwoods of the past and the lost jobs of the present with the new high-quality jobs of the future. 'And, yes, patriotism means a strong Scottish parliament but it doesn't need or require us to reject the partnership that allows us to fund the pensions of this country, sharing the resources of 60 million people across the whole country, far better than pooling the resources of only five million people, to secure the best pensions imaginable.' SNP Leader Nicola Sturgeon joins  female activists in Glasgow's Buchanan Street to launch the party's womens pledge today Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: 'While Gordon Brown appears to be re-fighting last year's referendum, the SNP are out talking to voters about next month's General Election and the huge opportunity to make Scotland stronger at Westminster. The contrast could not be clearer.

    "document": "Greece has denied it will fail to pay a multi-million pound loan following reports it has drawn up plans to introduce parallel drachma currency to pay domestic bills. The country is due to repay a £330million loan to the International Monetary Fund on Thursday but there were concerns the heavily indebted nation would default on the payment. Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time. Greece has denied it will miss a repayment of £330million to the International Monetary Fund after reports it had drawn up plans to introduce a parallel drachma currency to pay its bills He said: 'We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time. We are ready to pay on April 9.' Sources close to the ruling Syriza party claimed the government was prioritising paying wages and pensions over any loans due, according to the Telegraph. It  reported that the nation no longer has the funds to repay the debt unless the eurozone agrees to pay the next portion of its interim bail-out deal in time. A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer. 'We may have to go into a silent arrears process with the IMF. This will cause a furore in the markets and means that the clock will start to tick much faster.' German magazine Der Spiegel quoted a finance ministry general secretary, Nikos Theocharakis, as saying Greece would probably not pay next week's IMF tranche, prompting a further denial from the Greek finance ministry. Theocharakis said Greece would be 'close to the end' on April 9 and called the technical teams from its creditors 'completely useless,' according to an extract of the article due to be published on Saturday. 'Mr. Theocharakis never characterised the technical teams of the institutions with the phrase attributed to him,' the ministry said in a statement. 'On the contrary ... he referred to them as saying they include 'top-notch people with impressive skills.'' Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas (pictured) said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time Germany's Spiegel Online quoted Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt as saying that Greece postponing the repayment due on April 9 was 'out of the question', otherwise a Greek exit from the eurozone could no longer be ruled out. He said the Eurogroup would not release further funds to Greece until Athens implemented some of the reforms it had promised. Athens has not received bailout funds since August last year and has resorted to measures such as borrowing from state entities via repo transactions to tide it through the cash crunch. The government is hoping approval of its latest reforms package will unlock remaining aid of 7.2 billion euros under its EU/IMF bailout and lead to the return of about 1.9 billion euros in profits made by the European Central Bank on Greek bonds. Mardas said, without providing figures, that state revenue in March had topped targets and that the government had made progress in talks with lenders on its latest reforms list. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Greece would receive fresh funds only once its creditors approve the reforms Athens has presented.",

    "document": "Germans now think of themselves as the victims of Hitler and his Nazi Regime Germans no longer see the Second World War as a defeat and now think of themselves as victims of the Nazis, it has been claimed. Nearly 70 years after the end of the conflict, attitudes are reportedly changing among the younger generation. Research carried out by the Forsa Institute found the number of people who considered the end of the conflict a defeat fell to just nine per cent - a 25 per cent drop in the last decade. Instead, they now exploring the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans, the Times reported. The findings have been published exactly 70 years after Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin. Author Florian Huber has sold tens of thousand of copies of his book, Child Promise Me You Will Shoot Yourself, which examines the number of German suicides after peace was declared. 'German journalists are interested in my book, but they keep asking me whether I am doing something to make Germans out as victims, which is not allowed, it seems,' he reportedly told the newspaper. 'We have to think of ourselves as the bad guys, and it is still a controversial thing to suggest otherwise.' Crimes committed against ordinary Germans by the Allies and the millions that were left uprooted by war are also the subject of other tomes. The German city of Munich is today opening a new museum dedicated to exploring its past as the birthplace of the Nazi movement. The Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism charts the rise of the Nazi party from its founding in the Bavarian capital in 1920, a year before Adolf Hitler became its leader. German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters praised the city for tackling what she called 'the long repressed confrontation with the special role Munich played.' Gruetters noted that Germany's effort to examine its past - which encompassed World War II and the murder of millions the Nazis considered unworthy of life - is getting harder by the year because the number of witnesses is dwindling. Only nine per cent of Germans now consider the end of the conflict a defeat. Pictured:Operation Overlord in June 1944",

    "document": "They are a stunning visualisation of the art - and how it is orange. A programmer has created these stunning graphs to reveal the dominant colour of artworks through history They show Orange has always been the most popular colour - although in recent years blue has begun to catch up. The software extracts the relevant colour information from images or artworks found online. The plot above is based on 94,526 images for the years 1800-2000. The graph shows a clear trend toward more blue paintings toward the end of the 20th Century, with all colours increasing except for orange. 'I made a visualization of the change in colors of paintings over time,' said Martin Bellander, a PhD student in psychology at the Karolinska Institute who created the graph. To do this, he wrote software first to scrape the images of the paintings from sites where they were available for free download - BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. Then, the software extract the relevant colour information from them, and plots it in a nice way. He found the paintings change over time - from orange to blue. 'The changes in color might be a results of a combination of factor,' he wrote. 'One of these could of course be trends in the use of colour. 'If we assume a smooth linear deterioration of certain colours in oil paintings, it would be possible to subtract that change and study the short term fluctuation in colour use. 'For example the marked increase of blue at the time of the First World War, might actually reflect a true trend in colour use.' Two versions of Van Gogh's Sunflowers painting on show at the National Gallery in in London, England: Yellow and orange are the most popular colours in artworks from 1800, it has been found. Bellander used freely available images for the project. 'There are a bunch of different sites where you can access (photos of) paintings,  for instance the BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. .'One of my favorites is the BBC's site where you can browse through over 200K of well organized paintings - an amazing resource. 'For many of these there is also information on the year they were painted, the artist, etc.' He believes that some experts who have claimed perhaps the change is due top the price of paint are wrong. 'I haven’t found any data on the prices of blue, so that explanation is hard to elaborate on. 'However, it is not only blue that increases but all colors except orange, which might speak against the pigment prices explanation. ' The same graph, but with only oil paintings 'UnTrou sur l'Orange' by Jesus Rafael Soto: Researcher have found orange is by far the most common colour in art.",

Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

    "document": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Stan Freberg, whose freewheeling comic career in advertising garnered him worldwide acclaim and whose satirical entertainments abounded on TV, the radio and on records, has died. He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. \"He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,\" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a \"guerilla satirist.\" The New York Times dubbed him the \"Che Guevara of advertising,\" and years later, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. \"Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,\" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. \"RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend.\" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. \"Wun'erful Wun'erful,\" his 1957 spoof of \"champagne music\" — on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May — lampooned \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit \"Cry,\" which Freberg rendered as \"Try.\" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including \"St. George and the Dragonet,\" a 1953 send-up of the series \"Dragnet.\" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, \"That's Rich.\" Three years later, he presented \"The Stan Freberg Show\" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: \"Mad Men's\" return He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for \"The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows.\" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy \"Time for Beany,\" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an \"office\" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show \"Toast of the Town.\" Hollywood Reporter: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" -- the untold story Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as \"Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,\" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in \"Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was \"More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,\" and he even had a corporate motto: \"Ars Gratia Pecuniae\" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon \"What's Brewin', Bruin,\" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's \"Three Little Bops.\" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's \"Lady and the Tramp\" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, \"Back in Action\" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear.

    "document": "Mike Tindall wouldn't have moved any quicker had he been surging towards the posts in a Six Nations clash at Twickenham. In Aintree's crowded unsaddling area, the former England captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number '3', with his wife, Zara Phillips, scampering in hot pursuit. Not even a hug from AP McCoy could check his momentum. No wonder. Tindall was beaming from ear-to-ear having just seen Monbeg Dude, the horse whom he owns with James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson, run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior, who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1, returned. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall and wife Zara Philipps at Aintree ahead of the Grand National Tindall celebrates after watching his horse Monbeg Dude finish third in the National Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost £12,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. Here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the Crabbie's Grand National. The £88,400 was by far the biggest pot Monbeg Dude has collected in his 24-race career but the reactions of Tindal et al (ITALICISE) showed this was about far more than money. 'Pride is the word I would use,' said Michael Scudamore. 'I am so happy for the horse. He is unbelievably tough and brave. To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow. But what a great day. I really appreciate everything about this atmosphere now.' He wasn't the only one. Aintree, even when you are defeated, is a place where dreams can come true.",

    "document": "Spain's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday brought back bitter memories of their disastrous 2014 World Cup, but coach Vicente del Bosque will not be too worried about a third straight friendly defeat, insists Gerard Pique. Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team. Stefan de Vrij (right) headed Holland in front against Spain at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday Gerard Pique (left) could do nothing to stop Davy Klaassen doubling the Dutch advantage Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo became the 55th and 56th players to debut under Del Bosque, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea, defenders Raul Albiol, Juan Bernat and Dani Carvajal and midfielder Mario Suarez all started the game. 'The national team's state of health is good,' centre back Gerard Pique told reporters. 'We are in a process where players are coming into the team and gathering experience,' added the Barcelona defender. 'We are second in qualifying (for Euro 2016) and these friendly games are for experimenting. 'I am not that worried about this match because we lost friendlies in previous years and then ended up winning titles.' David de Gea was given a start by Vicente del Bosque but could not keep out De Vrij's header here Dani Carvajal (centre) was another squad player given a chance to impress against Holland Del Bosque will be confident he can find the right mix of players to secure Spain's berth at Euro 2016 in France next year, when they will be chasing an unprecedented third straight title. Slovakia are the surprise leaders in qualifying Group C thanks to a 2-1 win over Spain in Zilina in October and have a maximum 15 points from five of 10 matches. Spain are second on 12 points, three ahead of Ukraine, who they beat 1-0 in Seville on Friday. Del Bosque's side host Slovakia in September in a match that could decide who goes through to the finals as group winners. 'The team is in good shape,' forward Pedro told reporters. 'We have a very clear idea of our playing style and we are able to count on people who are gradually making a place for themselves in the team.'",

    "document": "Documented and undocumented immigrant population in the United States could reach a record high of 51million in just eight years, according to U.S. Census figures. And by 2060, immigrants could account for 82 per cent of all population growth in the country. One in seven U.S. residents will be an immigrant by 2023, the report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) said. Documented and undocumented immigrants in the United States could reach a record high in the United States by 2023, when their share of the population could hit 14.8 per cent That number could rise to one in five by 2060, when immigrant population reaches 78 million. This report comes as President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) policies. Net immigration will steadily increase over the next 45 years, totaling at 64million Without no change in current immigration policy, by 2023 the total immigrant population in the United states will reach 14.8 per cent, the highest ever recorded in American history Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population and will reach 15.8 per cent of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent by 2060 In 1990, immigrants accounted for just 7.9 per cent of U.S. population U.S population could grow to 417million by 2016. In 2010 the population was 306million Without a change to immigration policty, immigrants who arrive in the future and their descendants could account for three quarters of future U.S. population Center for Immigration Studies This could potentially exempt about five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. And with the surge in immigrant population, Republican presidential candidates have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established. CIS director of research Steven Camarota said that the growth in immigrant population has 'important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment'. 'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner. There are also more than 4.4million people on a U.S. State Department green card waiting list. And within years, Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population. From a starting point of 2010, immigration population will reach 15.8 per cent (57million) of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 (65million) per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent (78million)  by 2060. Immigrants and their descendants will account for 75.5 per cent of the nation's population growth between 2010 and 2050 and 82 per cent of growth between 2010 and 2060. By 2060, immigrants and their descendants will account for 82 per cent of the nation's population growth since 2010 President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand immigration policies, which could potentially exempt about 5million undocumented immigrants from deportation Alabama Rep. Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has been a leader in the immigration debate, said in a letter to the New York Times on Saturday that an increase of immigrants in the country will hurt the middle class. He wrote: 'It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. 'Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?' Key business leaders form a group association with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are meeting on Friday to discuss expanding immigration. The meeting it titled 'Understanding and Improving the High-Skilled H-1B Visa Program', according to the examiner. Republican leaders, particularly those running in the presidential race for 2016, have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established",

Great Manchester Police Chadderton division revealed a man lodged a complaint that the weather on his holiday was 'too hot' The incident was shared by the police press office on its Facebook page, along with a warning that members of the public should not waste police time. There was a warning that such an offence can carry a maximum punishment of six months' imprisonment and/or a fine. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police told MailOnline Travel: 'The male was advised that this was not a police problem.' Following the post being shared on Facebook, there were mixed reactions to the man's actions. Janine Gamblen wrote: 'Some people really are just stupid,' while Sarah Edwards added: 'Only in Oldham.'

However, Joanne Parker made light of the incident writing: 'Haha funny...would love to have seen the police face.' The current temperatures in Algeria is 28C, and this has remained fairly constant over the last week or two. Temperatures are set to peak at 25C over the next three days in England, however the north will see slightly lower temperatures than the south.

Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his phone in the middle of a match. The two-time national champion was exposed when his opponent lodged a complaint when he grew suspicious about his frequent trips to the lavatory. Tournament organisers found Nigalidze had stored a mobile phone in a cubicle, covered in toilet paper. They announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page. The complaint was made by Nigalidze's opponent in their sixth-round match in the tournament, Armenia's Tigran Petrosian. He said: 'Nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet. 'I noticed that he would always visit the same toilet partition, which was strange, since two other partitions weren't occupied. 'I informed the chief arbiter about my growing suspicions and asked him to keep an eye on Gaioz. 'After my opponent left the very toilet partition yet another time, the arbiters entered it. 'What they found was the mobile phone with headphones; the device was hidden behind the pan and covered with toilet paper.' Tournament organisers at the Dubai Open Chess tournament announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page When officials confronted the Georgian, he denied owning the device but officials found the phone was logged into a social networking site under his name. They also found his match being analysed in one of the chess applications. He was promptly removed from the tournament and could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game. When questioned about the offence, Nigalidze said: 'Not everything is true in what Petrosian said'. This is not the first time a player was caught cheating at a chess tournament. In July 2013, Bulgarian player Borislav Ivanov was suspended from playing for four months by his national federation. It had been found most of his moves matched those of the leading computer chess analysis programs. Two years earlier the French chess federation suspended three players, including the national team captain, when it was alleged they used text messages, a remote chess computer and coded signals to beat the opposition at the 2010 Chess Olympiad. In 2008, at the Dubai Open, an Iranian player was banned when he was found to be receiving help from someone watching the game's live broadcast on the internet and was sending the moves through text messages. Tournaments sanctioned by the International Chess Federation - including the Dubai Open - do not allow players to carry mobile phones and other electronic devices during matches.",

    "document": "Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight.

The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents.

    "document": "This is the embarrassing moment a Buckingham Palace guard slipped and fell on a manhole cover in front of hundreds of shocked tourists as he took up position in his sentry box. The Queen's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera. He lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle. The Queen's Guard (pictured) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week. Unfortunately for him, the entire incident was caught on a tourist's camera . The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded . The moment it all started to go wrong: The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip . The unidentified young guard's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away . The guard, wearing full regalia, falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up . 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard. Contrary to popular belief they are not purely ceremonial and are fully operational soldiers. The Ministry of Defence said they would not comment on 'a young man falling over while doing his job'.

Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House. The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day. He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s. Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s . But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified, he claims. Mr Lawler, now 64, said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother’s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27. He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift. Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them – one a senior member of staff, he said. He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself. ‘That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me,’ he told the Sunday People. ‘I was staggered. The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me, holding me in the chair. Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence . ‘They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room.’ Afterwards, Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet. A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House – so he packed his bags immediately. Mr Lawler, a former Port of Liverpool police officer, said he was ‘haunted’ by the incident for years. After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace, but was twice rebuffed. Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard. A retired royal aide, who is now in his 80s, was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time. Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work ‘exhaustively and co-operatively’ with any police probe. A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment ‘as investigations continue’.",

The clip, which features Jesse and Melissa Meek rapping as they drive in a car, has been viewed over 1.7 million times on YouTube. 'In Happy Valley, Oregon, livin' it wed, bought our first house and started to build our homestead,' Melissa says in the clip. Parents: Jesse and Melissa Meek announced they are expecting a child in a video set to the theme song from '90s television sitcom 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' The original song for the popular NBC sitcom, sung by star Will Smith, details how his character grew up in West Philadelphia, where he got into a neighborhood fight - and at his mother's insistence, moved to his aunt and uncle's home in their wealthy Los Angeles neighborhood. In the Meeks' parody video, Melissa raps, 'When our family and friends, who were up to no good, started asking questions about parenthood. 'We told one little lie, said \"It's not time yet.\" Parents said \"We're ready for grandkids, get a move on it!\"' Jesse raps that the couple thought it would take longer than the two months the pair spent trying to conceive. Melissa says in the video 'I woke up in the morning about 7 or 8 and I thought to myself, \"Oh man, I'm late!\" Looked at the test and it was finally there. The little plus sign. We're now three. Not a pair.' At the end of the video, the Meeks smile and share a sonogram of their unborn child. It took five takes to film the clip, the couple told KPTV. After finding out the gender of the child, another video is a possibility for the Meeks, the couple told the Fox affiliate. Original: Will Smith is seen here rapping the theme for 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' during the show's title sequence . Big reveal: At the end of the clip, the Meeks share a sonogram of their unborn child . According to KPTV, the video was made so loved ones living far away could know about the baby. Melissa told the Fox affliate of the video's success 'It was completely unexpected. Like, that was the last thing we thought would happen, that it would blow up to what it had, or what it has.' Jesse told the Oregonian 'It has been a lot of fun, but definitely way more than we ever expected.' He is the great-great-grandson of Oregon pioneer Joseph Lafayette Meek, the newspaper reported. The Oregonian reported that Melissa earlier made a video which captured Jesse's reaction when he found out about the pregnancy. Jesse learned the news after reading a tag Melissa placed on their dog, which indicated a baby was on the way.

A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5.

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea .

The four-time Olympic champion and 2012 Tour de France winner, who is 35 on April 28, will attempt to add to his accomplishments by riding the furthest distance in 60 minutes at the Lee Valley VeloPark. 'The Hour Record is a holy grail for cyclists,' Wiggins said. Four-time Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins will bid to break cycling's hour record in June . Wiggins finished his Team Sky career in the Paris-Roubaix 253.5km one-day race on Sunday . Australian rider Rohan Dennis poses after breaking the world hour record on February 8 in Grenchen . 'It's been fought over tooth and nail by some of the greatest names in our sport for over a hundred years and it's time for me to have a crack at it. 'I like the idea of challenging myself and want to motivate people to do the same - so why not get your bike out of the shed and see how far you can go in an hour?' Wiggins, whose track pedigree includes three Olympic gold medals, is expected to set a mark which will last for some time. Wiggins will hope for a capacity 6,000 crowd to spur on his attempt, with tickets going on sale from April 19, while the event will be broadcast live on Sky Sports. In June, Wiggins will hope to race in front of a sell-out crowd at London's Olympic Velodrome . Wiggins (left) alongside his Team Sky colleague Luke Rowe after the pair raced the Paris-Roubaix . Wiggins will look to beat the record of Dennis (pictured), who managed to cycle 52.491km in an hour . The Briton finished his Team Sky career at Paris-Roubaix last Sunday and will ride in next month's inaugural Tour de Yorkshire for his eponymous team before preparing for the Hour as part of his return to the track. The world time-trial champion is targeting a British record eighth Olympic medal - he has four gold, one silver and two bronze - at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the four-man, four-kilometre team pursuit. The current Hour record is 52.491km, set by Australian Rohan Dennis in February after the UCI, cycling's world governing body, reformed regulations, reigniting interest in the event. German Jens Voigt was the first to make an attempt last September, recording 51.115km, a mark which stood for six weeks before Austria's Matthias Brandle rode 51.852km, while Jack Bobridge was the first to fall short in his attempt. Dennis' mark will come under threat from Briton Alex Dowsett, who will make his attempt on May 2 in Manchester having had to postpone it previously after suffering a broken collarbone. Tickets to watch Sir Bradley Wiggins attempt to break the UCI Hour Record at the Lee Valley VeloPark on June 7 will go on sale to the general public through Sky Tickets from Friday, April 19 (10am) price £49, £39 and £29, on line sale only through the Sky Tickets website.",

The Briton finished his Team Sky career at Paris-Roubaix last Sunday and will ride in next month's inaugural Tour de Yorkshire for his eponymous team before preparing for the Hour as part of his return to the track. The world time-trial champion is targeting a British record eighth Olympic medal - he has four gold, one silver and two bronze - at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the four-man, four-kilometre team pursuit. The current Hour record is 52.491km, set by Australian Rohan Dennis in February after the UCI, cycling's world governing body, reformed regulations, reigniting interest in the event. German Jens Voigt was the first to make an attempt last September, recording 51.115km, a mark which stood for six weeks before Austria's Matthias Brandle rode 51.852km, while Jack Bobridge was the first to fall short in his attempt. Dennis' mark will come under threat from Briton Alex Dowsett, who will make his attempt on May 2 in Manchester having had to postpone it previously after suffering a broken collarbone. Tickets to watch Sir Bradley Wiggins attempt to break the UCI Hour Record at the Lee Valley VeloPark on June 7 will go on sale to the general public through Sky Tickets from Friday, April 19 (10am) price £49, £39 and £29, on line sale only through the Sky Tickets website.",

The US  were beaten 3-2 as Williams and Alison Riske were thrashed 6-0 6-3 in the doubles rubber by Errani and Flavia Pennetta, meaning they were relegated to World Group II. American tennis star Serena Williams fought back to beat Italian Sara Errani in the Fed Cup play-off on Sunday .

    "document": "(CNN)Eight Iranian border guards have been killed in clashes with militants near the border with Pakistan, Iranian state media reported. Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur, the state-run news agency IRNA reported.

A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization. According to Pakistani media, Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan, the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran. The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory. One of the deadliest was in October 2013, when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan. Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks, the militants have fled back into Balochistan. \"Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists,\" IRNA said, referring to Pakistan. The Pakistani government condemned Monday's attack, calling it an \"act of terrorism.\" \"The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident, which took place on Iran's territory, and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have,\" the government said in a statement Wednesday.

Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. \"When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,\" Nakatani said. He continued: \"They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth.\" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as \"among the most respected men in sports-entertainment\" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's \"basketball diplomacy\" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet.

    "document": "Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man . A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail.",

Japanese photographer Yûki Aoyama's latest series of images capture po-faced teenagers pictured next to their fathers leaping into the air. In each picture the daughter looks directly into the camera smiling while her father pulls a dramatic pose. A series of images by photographer Yûki Aoyama sees fathers leaping into the air next to their daughters . The images are from the 37-year-old's latest book which roughly translates into Daughter and Salary Man. According to the  photographer's website the images allow the father who usually has to act serious to express his fun side by being 'a hero jumping the sky, enfold(ing) strong excitement and hope.' Salary man may refer to the choice of clothing in the shoot which sees each dad in a sharply dressed suit. The images see the fathers pull energetic poses despite their age with some of the expressions of the older fathers looking slightly pained. Very little else is known about the pictures or why they have come into existence but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online for their curious nature. The 37-year-old's images are said to be part of a book which roughly translates as Daughter and Salaryman . Each image sees the daughter stood po-faced as their father makes an energetic leap . Some of the older fathers adopt a pained expression as they make their jump . Each photograph sees the daughter wearing casual clothing with her father in a sharp suit . The pictures see the families pose in front of various Japanese landmarks . Very little is known about the set of photos but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online . Some of the jumps are more subtle than others with this father opting for a classic jump . This young girl can't help but giggle at her dad's ambitious leap . This dapper dad adds a peace gesture into his final pose . This father can't help but jump for joy in his portrait .",

A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the Dallas Morning News. She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials. At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her. A spokesman for the police department said: 'There was some discussion, some rumoring, there may have been a second person involved. 'That information came from within the school, and it turned out to be true.' Granado, who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas (pictured), was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy, also 15, and lettin him touch her breasts . Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday, and released after posting a $50,000 bail.

At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation . They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year. I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation. Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone . 'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope. We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all. Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope. We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.' James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth . Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday. But the Dutchman left with his own problems, after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice. Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules cannot be broken by anyone. Koeman said: 'I already had a word with Mane but we will talk to the team about that because maybe I have to mention it a bit more clearly.'",

    "document": "A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.",

While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday . The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home.

    "document": "Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil seemed to be in a enjoying his home comforts after arriving back in London following the international break, posting a picture putting his feet up with his dog. The German star was in fine form as the World Cup winners beat Georgia 2-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday, and is now setting his sights on the Premier League encounter with Liverpool at the weekend. And Ozil gave an insight into what he does in his downtime after taking a snap of him playing with his pet with the caption: 'Home Sweet Home'. Mesut Ozil posted a picture on Twitter relaxing with his dog on Wednesday after returning home to London . Ozil impressed on international duty as Germany beat Gerogia 2-0 in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday . The midfielder, who was signed for £42.5million from Real Madrid in 2013, missed Arsenal's last game against Newcastle through illness, but will be expected to start against Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium.

The club's vice-captain had 14 months remaining on his current contract and his advisors had been in talks with Liverpool since the beginning of this season. They have now reached a resolution and Henderson is expected to put pen-to-paper on improved terms that are likely be worth in the region of £100,000. His new deal will run to 2020. Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson is set to sign a new long-term contract at Anfield . Henderson chases down Aston Villa's Jack Grealish during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat at Wembley . Henderson's new deal is worth around £100,000-a-week and will run until the summer of 2020 . Henderson, 24, is the third big player in Brendan Rodgers' squad to agree a contract extension, following on from Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho. The England international, who was signed by Kenny Dalglish in June 2011 for £16million from Sunderland, has been one of the most improved players under Rodgers' watch. His form this season has been excellent and he has contributed 13 assists as well as seven goals from midfield; he will be considered for the role of club captain when Steven Gerrard moves to LA Galaxy.

    "document": "Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’",

He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. \"The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,\" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.",

April 19 West Ham United (H) April 25 Aston Villa (H) May 3 Tottenham Hotspur (A) May 10 Queens Park Rangers (H) May 17 Swansea City (A) May 24 Southampton (H) 'In the last three months, we have thrown it into the garbage,' admitted the City manager. 'We are doing some things very badly, that’s why we must improve.' They now face a battle to sign world-class players like Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba who also interests United. Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal saw his side go four points clear of City after the victory and is confident of adding top-class talent in the next transfer window. 'I don't have any doubt that players are coming to Manchester United,' he said.",

For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser.

That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: \"Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.\" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to \"reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.",

The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.",

The 69-year-old collaborated with NBC's Today show to launch a contest for one Elvis-obsessed couple to win the 'ultimate wedding'. The winning duo - announced next Monday - will tie the knot at Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel inside the Westgate Hotel on Thursday, April 23. Novel idea: Priscilla Presley will serve as a witness at the first wedding to be held at an all new chapel of love in Las Vegas . Westgate, formerly the Las Vegas Hilton, is where Elvis performed more than 830 sold-out shows. Along with the singer's former wife in the audience, the winning couple will  win a free wedding reception and hotel suite for two nights. To top it off, airfares and concert tickets to the Elvis Experience theater show will also be thrown in. While Priscilla agreed to make an appearance, the woman who wed Elvis in 1967 made one thing clear before unveiling the latest wedding chapel to bear his name: No impersonators. 'This is all first-class,' she told the Associated Press recently. 'This is not a joke. The wedding chapel is not a joke.' The actress and business magnate has been involved in the look and feel of the chapel that officials say is part of the first permanent Graceland exhibit of the singer's artifacts outside his iconic Memphis, Tennessee, home. Couples wanting to be the first  to  wed at the Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel must submit a video or photos along with an explanation detailing why they deserve the prize.

    "document": "Roma ended their four-month winless streak at home with a victory over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday in a key match for Champions League places. Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half. 'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack . Pjanic (second left) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe, and Daniele de Rossi after scoring . Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio, who play later on Saturday. They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth. Security was tight for Napoli's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game . Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points . Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order. But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post. A few minutes later, Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi, who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in. Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home . Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma, who have fallen off the pace recently . Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there wasn't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli, who officiated last year's World Cup final. In the second half, De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions. The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th. Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net. Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November.",

The top two sides in Group B meet at the Cardiff City Stadium on June 12 with Wales in their best position to qualify for a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden. Belgium and Wales both have 11 points from five games with Marc Wilmots' side - ranked fourth in the world - on top spot because of a superior goal difference. Wales'  Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium this summer has been declared a 33,000 sell-out . Gareth Bale fires homes a brilliant free-kick during Wales' 3-0 victory over Israel in Euro 2016 qualifying . Real Madrid star Bale celebrates as the victory took Wales to the top of the Group B table on goal difference . But Wales' comprehensive 3-0 victory in Israel last weekend has seen expectations rise that Chris Coleman's charges can claim one of the two automatic qualifying spots and make it all the way to the 2016 finals in France. 'The stunning performance in Israel has created a huge buzz around Chris Coleman's team and the FAW has been inundated with orders for tickets,' the Football Association of Wales said in a statement on its website.

The top two sides in Group B meet at the Cardiff City Stadium on June 12 with Wales in their best position to qualify for a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden. Belgium and Wales both have 11 points from five games with Marc Wilmots' side - ranked fourth in the world - on top spot because of a superior goal difference. Wales'  Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium this summer has been declared a 33,000 sell-out . Gareth Bale fires homes a brilliant free-kick during Wales' 3-0 victory over Israel in Euro 2016 qualifying . Real Madrid star Bale celebrates as the victory took Wales to the top of the Group B table on goal difference . But Wales' comprehensive 3-0 victory in Israel last weekend has seen expectations rise that Chris Coleman's charges can claim one of the two automatic qualifying spots and make it all the way to the 2016 finals in France. 'The stunning performance in Israel has created a huge buzz around Chris Coleman's team and the FAW has been inundated with orders for tickets,' the Football Association of Wales said in a statement on its website.

The bereaved mother, named Dawn, was appearing on The Jeremy Kyle show and accused long-term chum, convicted burglar Jamie, of making off with the cash. When one of Mr Kyle's famous lie detector tests revealed that Jamie, who lives with Dawn and her partner who is also called Jamie, had done the deed, she burst into tears and stormed off. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Dawn, who has had seven miscarriages, was furious to discover her friend had stolen from her . The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that £207 set aside for a £500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.' Unable to prove it, she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back, it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash. Caught out: Jamie, who has been to prison for burglary, was found to be lying after taking a test . Outraged: Dawn, who was going to spend the money on a gravestone, was left furious by the revelation . Mr Kyle also revealed that Jamie had sent a Facebook message to Dawn during the journey to London in which he declared his undying love and confessed to taking the money but blamed it on girlfriend Carol.

    "document": "(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.",

Jamie Carragher shared this image on Instagram after collecting a Beacon Award on Tuesday . 'It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four.

'The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. Carragher, pictured at the 26th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, backed Rodgers to stay at Anfield . The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. 'I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would.

The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. Carragher, pictured at the 26th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, backed Rodgers to stay at Anfield . The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. 'I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would. 'There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area.'",

    "document": "Four-year-old James Hayward had his toy gun confiscated at East Midlands Airport . A four-year-old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk. James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video . After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun . The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport . The £6 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.'

Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs . Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise) Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call . Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters . A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason. 'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write.

    "document": "(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for \"Barbara,\" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the \"warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited \"three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,\" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. \"For her to go to Mexico,\" Mate said, \"It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from.\" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to \"navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,\" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. \"Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look,\" Mate said.

    "document": "Residents on the east coast of Japan's Hokkaido Island had an unexpected change of scenery this morning after 1,000ft of seabed was forced to the surface overnight. The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby, when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video . Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan . 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide', local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday. The mass, which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level,  measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide, a town official said. The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the land movement overnight . 'The local residents said they didn't hear any sounds and there were no tremors (when the land appeared),' said Katsuhiro Tanaka, the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association, who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered. The mass, which has risen some 50ft above sea level, measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide . No clue: Local residents on Hokkaido island say they felt no tremors overnight, or heard any sounds to indicate movement, and that the landmass just appeared . New view: Local residents from Rausu, Hokkaido, take a look at the newly emerged coastline . Authorities have not been able to determine exactly when the landslide hit the snow-covered coastline, but they do not expect it to expand further, said an official at the central government's Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau. 'Our understanding is that this is different from earthquakes,' he told AFP. It is not believed to be related to the 7.8magnitude earthquake that struck the Kathmandu Valley on Saturday, which so far has claimed more than 4,000 lives. Under the sea: Marine organisms such as seaweed and sea urchins are still attached to the land mass .",

The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby, when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video . Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan . 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide', local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday. The mass, which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level,  measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide, a town official said. The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the land movement overnight . 'The local residents said they didn't hear any sounds and there were no tremors (when the land appeared),' said Katsuhiro Tanaka, the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association, who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered. The mass, which has risen some 50ft above sea level, measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide . No clue: Local residents on Hokkaido island say they felt no tremors overnight, or heard any sounds to indicate movement, and that the landmass just appeared . New view: Local residents from Rausu, Hokkaido, take a look at the newly emerged coastline . Authorities have not been able to determine exactly when the landslide hit the snow-covered coastline, but they do not expect it to expand further, said an official at the central government's Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau. 'Our understanding is that this is different from earthquakes,' he told AFP. It is not believed to be related to the 7.8magnitude earthquake that struck the Kathmandu Valley on Saturday, which so far has claimed more than 4,000 lives. Under the sea: Marine organisms such as seaweed and sea urchins are still attached to the land mass .",

The former Manchester City striker's deal with the Serie A champions does not expire until the end of next season but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer . Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory . 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016.

'I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought, because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones.'

Mr Gordon, who  was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history . The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with users questioning his terminology. 'Irrespective of his weird use of the term 'black puppet' it's kinda odd how Bob Katter is speaking on Billy Gordon's behalf' wrote Benjamin James. Not that John wrote: 'Wow, Bob Katter calls Billy Gordon, 'black puppet on a string' and the lefty loons stay silent. What if Abbott had said it?' The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with some users questioning his terminology . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet in light of his personal experiences . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet 'because I'm dark and I come from Cloncurry.' 'I can understand and I can identify with the attitudes that these people have and I'm going to call it for what it is,' he said. 'I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought, because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones.' Mr Katter used federal MPs Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott as examples of independents becoming puppets for the government and sacrificing their independence, but he vowed Mr Gordon would not make that mistake.",

Her hope is that the video not only entertains, but inspires others to think before judging.

Patient satisfaction: A chiropractor in Iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients.

The agreement requires that Manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to Manuel's home from the Des Moines Register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time.

On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were \"unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,\" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will \"file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels\" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it \"one of the most dangerous close passes in decades.\" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident.

An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft, which the police report states happened overnight. The theft happened just a week before Obama (pictured during his visit) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month . Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case.

The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick – awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon – rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch . Barkley's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park . Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it. Otherwise, I am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how they feel at that moment,' argued the Everton manager. Baines (left) has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League . 'Ross showed incredible responsibility to take it. I love seeing players take control of the big moments and Leighton was happy to given him that responsibility.' Barkley's penalty was well-struck but wasn't put in the corner and Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton dived to his right to save. Fortunately for the young England player, it didn't prove costly as Mirallas went on to score the only goal of the game after 29 minutes.

    "document": "Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction, and even the odd Bond movie. But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.",

Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.",

    "document": "A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'",

She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. \"In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,\" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,\" Sterling said.

    "document": "Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal's recent dealings in the transfer window and has urged his former side to purchase four top players in the summer. The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack . Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing . Hull (away) - May 4 . Swansea (home) - May 11 . Man United (away) - May 17 .

You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league.

Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December – but didn’t have enough cash to pay for it. An inquest heard he ran from the driver, who gave chase at the seaside town of Penarth, South Wales. Cabbie Dave Sidaway told the inquest: ‘I stopped because I couldn’t see where I was going.

The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to ‘use an ATM’ before making a run for it. ‘The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi – I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,’ Mr Robinson told the inquest. ‘Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.’ Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker.

He had grown up in Barry, South Wales, before studying accountancy at the University of Birmingham. The inquest heard that he had returned to Wales for Christmas and had been staying with his mother in the upmarket Cowbridge area. Mr Phillips had planned to stay at a friend’s house but he and his friends didn’t have enough money to complete the journey, so decided to trick the driver by ‘dodging’ the fare. Mr Phillips ran off into the ‘pitch black’ and fell down a cliff at the end of the disused Northern Promenade – also called The Dardanelles. Police search the scene at the bottom of the cliff where his body was discovered .",

    "document": "It's well known that exercise can make your muscles bigger. Now, a study has found it may make your brain larger, too. Physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain, increasing the size of areas that contribute to balance and coordination, according to Health Day news. The changes in the brain may have health implications in the long-term, such as reducing the risk of falling, said the study's author, Dr Urho Kujala, of the University of Jyvaskyla. Scroll down for video Exercise can increase the size of areas of the brain that contribute to balance and coordination, a study found It could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age, he added. Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits, such as lower levels of body fat, reduced heart disease risk factors, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain. They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins, who were all men aged 32 to 36 years. Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria - structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain. This energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently, effectively keeping it younger, researchers said. In the short term this could reduce mental fatigue and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And building up a large reservoir of mitochondria in the brain could also create a 'buffer' against age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's.",

    "document": "Fighter ace: Douglas Bader's story is to be told in a Hollywood film dubbed ‘The First Great Escape’ The story of how Douglas Bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of Britain’s greatest fighter aces is remarkable enough. But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed ‘The First Great Escape’. Bader – who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 – was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader’s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as ‘the most brilliant escape conception of this war’. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp’s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break – August 30, 1942 – the prisoners managed to fuse the camp’s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a ‘home run’ back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the ‘escape-proof’ Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader’s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton’s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton’s book have been bought by the makers of 2013’s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting. Essential 11 did a fantastic job with Saving Mr Banks and to have that same team working on this is very pleasing.'",

    "document": "The view that Manchester City’s chance at defending their Premier League title has been ruined through bad spending gathered pace after they were defeated by a club whose entire team cost less than half one of their substitutes. Crystal Palace’s XI on Monday night may only have been worth a mere £17m, but left back Martin Kelly still made it through a City defence deemed good enough to keep £40m signing Eliaquim Mangala on the bench to tee up a chance for Wilfried Zaha just 60 seconds into the game. Mangala joined from Porto in August last year and is contracted to City until June 2019. Eliaquim Mangala (green bib) prepares to come on but he never made it off the Manchester City bench However, striker Glenn Murray succeeded in putting another dent in City’s chances of redeeming themselves after a run of four losses away, when he scored Palace’s first goal. Murray cost Palace nothing when joined from arch rivals Brighton in 2011. Jason Puncheon, signed for a comparative pittance of £1.9m, delivered City their final blow with a goal from a finely executed free-kick. Glenn Murray (left) cost Palace nothing four years ago yet found a way past the City defence Another expensive City player, £24m-man Yaya Toure, got his team back in the game with 12 minutes left, but they couldn’t penetrate Palace’s defence to find an equaliser and a 2-1 defeat leaves them nine points adrift of the top. Toure joined from Barcelona in July 2010 and is contracted to City until 2017. After spending a total of £500m pounds on transfer fees, City might have expected to be higher than a precarious fourth in the league, but judging by their latest results, it’s teams like Crystal Palace that seem to be getting their value for money. Mangala has endured a miserable first season at the Etihad Stadium since his £40million move",

    "document": "(CNN)Soon, America will be too fat to fight. Forget about rampant diabetes, heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country. In about five years, so many young Americans will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. That alarming forecast comes from Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, who is in charge of U.S. Army Recruiting Command. Obesity, he told me, \"is becoming a national security issue.\" I was so taken aback by Batschelet's statement that I felt the need to press him. Come on! Obesity? A national security crisis? The General didn't blink. \"In my view, yes.\" Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, or a lack of education, or too many tattoos. But a full 10% didn't qualify because they were overweight. Before you accuse me of sensationalizing, it's that 10% figure that worries General Batschelet the most. \"The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50%, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army.\" He paused. \"It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.\" The problem is so worrisome for the Army that recruiters have become fitness coaches, like the trainers on the NBC show, \"The Biggest Loser.\" Yes, your tax dollars pay for Army recruiters to play Dolvett Quince or Jillian Michaels to whip could-be recruits into shape with the hope they can diet and exercise their way to become real recruits. If they lose enough weight, they're sent to boot camp. Some make it; many don't. But, General Batschelet told me the Army must try. \"We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,\" he told me. \"We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.\" Except the Army never considered the type of growth it's now contending with. Nowadays \"personal development\" means working on both character and ... girth. The general, along with so many others in this country, is struggling with why so many Americans, despite all the warnings, continue to eat too much and exercise too little. I have a theory. It ain't pretty. But it's got to be true: We just don't care. \"The acceptance of obesity is prevalent,\" according to Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now. \"When you look around you, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. It's seems normal,\" she said. Just look at the numbers: More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese. That's triple the rate from just a generation ago. So, maybe we should face the fact that we've grown comfortable with our girth. It is crystal clear we haven't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who doesn't. Just the other day, Twitter trolls scolded the singer, Pink, for gaining weight. Pink is not remotely fat. Neither is Selena Gomez, haters. Or Britney Spears, hecklers. If 70% of us are overweight in this country, why are there so many willing to fat-shame people who are not remotely obese? Maybe it's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves. Because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial. Dr. Putnam points to one of Kaiser Permanante's medical questionnaires. You know, the paperwork patients are asked to fill out before they see the doctor. There is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to \"opt out of talking about obesity.\" Some patients refuse to step on the scale. \"You want to be sensitive to that patient,\" Putnam told me. \"You don't want to nag. But, doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this.\" CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, agrees with Putnam. \"Perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem,\" he said to me. \"If a person is overweight -- as difficult as it is -- they ought to be told. You know, this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions. We should call them what they really are: a brain injury, not 'getting your bell rung.' In the same vein, we should tell people who are overweight or obese that, clinically, they're 'overweight' or 'obese' and at risk for just about every chronic disease in the book.\" In other words, chubby is not the proper way to describe a person who is obese. Just like \"fat\" is not the proper term for Pink or Selena Gomez. And, yes, semantics matter. According to the CDC, 81% of overweight boys and 71% of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. We've clearly lost our perspective on what's normal when it comes to a healthy weight. So much so it's becoming a national security problem. So what will it take? The answer cannot be the U.S Army.",

    "document": "Queensland toddler Kyhesha-Lee Joughin was forced to use the room she was locked in as a toilet before dying in severe distress of internal injuries, a court has heard.Shocking allegations of the circumstances surrounding the three-year-old's 2013 death were revealed on Wednesday as family friend who was charged with the toddlers manslaughter was granted bail. The bail hearing revealed that Kyhesha-Lee suffered blows to her stomach causing severe bowel damage- ultimately leading to her death. The bail hearing revealed Kyesha-Lee succumbed to massive bowel injuries after being struck days before her death Kyhesha-Lee was in the care of her father Matthew Lee Williamson and Christopher Arthur Neville Kent who have both been charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. Crown prosecutor Vicki Loury alleged the toddler also suffered a penetrative injury to her vagina three days before her death. She was not seen of or heard of by anyone else in the five days prior to her death, although another man visited the home the night before Kyhesha-Lee died. 'She was by that stage in severe distress, extremely unwell,' Ms Loury told the court. Kyhesha-Lee Joughin  was allegedly locked in a bedroom by her father, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room Kyhesha-Lee's body was found days after she suffered the blows - allegedly in squalid surroundings - at the unit she shared with her father in Petrie, north of Brisbane, on March 30, 2013. Kent, 46, was granted bail in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday after the court heard he'd offered to plead guilty on the basis of criminal negligence. Williamson allegedly locked his daughter in the bedroom while he slept during the day, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room. Her father Matthew Lee Williamson and his friend Christopher Arthur Neville Kent, who also lived in the house and cared for the child in the days prior to her death, are each charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. They have both been released on bail Evidence of the child's blood had been found on Kent's shorts. 'It was a small unit, he must have been aware of what was happening with the child,' Ms Loury said. Chief Magistrate Ray Rinaudo agreed with Kent's barrister Soraya Ryan that the accused no longer presented a risk of fleeing or re-offending on bail.

    "document": "We are all guilty of taking the odd cheesy tourist photo, be it trying to push the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or 'touch' the top of a pyramid. One traveller in particular knows how wrong a holiday snap can go, after he posted a picture online of him 'missing' the top of the Eiffel Tower and asked users to help improve his photo. On a recent trip to Paris, Belgian food blogger Yves Van De Ven enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clichés and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments. Little did he know he would become an internet sensation, after his photo with the Eiffel Tower captioned 'nailed it' was uploaded to photosharing website 4chan. Since then over 100 photoshopped pictures have sprung up comically connecting his finger with the tip of the famous attraction, and it didn't stop there... Nailed it! Yves Van De Ven, 37, uploaded this photograph on social media in a bid to poke fun of the typical tourist pictures Going viral! An upload on photo-sharing site 4chan requested users connect his finger with the top of the tower, as many tourist pictures aim to achieve The 37-year-old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks. 'The original pictures in which me and my friends 'nailed it' were an instant hit with my friends as soon as I posted them on Facebook,' Van De Ven said. 'There were people that thought we just took poor pictures but luckily most of my friends know better.' Obviously the internet had something to say about the pictures and after someone uploaded the pictures to 4chan, users from all over the globe submitted their own 'improved' versions of Van De Ven's pictures. Created images ranged from the comical, with the 301m tower bent over to touch his outstretched finger, to the absurd, with Van De Ven imposed into Michaelango's Creation of Adam, reaching out towards the Eiffel Tower. The wondrous offerings demonstrate what a brilliant place the internet is, and how no one's holiday pictures are safe. Bendy tower! The tower appears to have flopped over in the summer heat, making a connection with the food blogger's finger Cut out! Despite covering the 37-year-old, his finger is clearly in contact in this picture! Expert photoshopping creates a miniature tower touching his finger, never mind about the gaping white hole left behind! Close enough! Tilting the tower 45 degrees, and extending his arm in an octopus fashion were methods used to 'improve' the picture Super hero! In a Hulk-like fashion, not only has Van De Ven knocked over the Eiffel Tower, but also has it grasped in two fingers Van De Ven is shocked but highly entertained at the widespread response to his holiday pictures. 'I can honestly say that we have had as much fun taking these silly pictures as we have had the week after overviewing the hilarious aftermath. 'Some of the photoshopped pictures are just brilliant.' Eiffel Tower touches Van De Ven! This photo plays on role reversal with the tower spectacularly missing touching him Basically there! A longer arm is all it takes to recreate the popular tourist pose If in doubt, enlarge the poser (left), or do as most people do and stand closer to the camera! Or why not create more failed fingers (right) to add to the picture? Why not just duplicate the offending failed finger all over the Eiffel Tower? (Still without it making contact!) See double! That works! Not only does he touch the top, he does it twice in this picture A portal has allowed the tip of the tower to protrude near the blogger's feet so he can touch the tip Why not ignore the failed hand all together, and just reposition it on top? Job done! (left) Or why not reverse the original photograph? (right) So elegant! The original pose has been imposed on a ballerina dancing on a studio Another wondrous offering from the internet shows him expertly defending a basketball hoop The internet wins again! Van De Ven (as God) reaching out for the Eiffel Tower (as man) in Michelangelo's famous painting, The Creation of Adam Bullrilliant! Van De Ven becomes a matador unperturbed by a bull with horns consisting of the Eiffel Tower",

    "document": "Haul: The cherry picker collecting drugs from the roof of HMP Altcourse in Liverpool The amount of drugs being thrown over the fence into one prison is so high that warders have been forced to deploy a cherry picker to remove them. Packages containing heroin and cannabis were cleared from the roof of HMP Altcourse in Liverpool - hurled there from the outside by friends of inmates who missed their intended targets. The hydraulic crane also recovered so-called 'legal highs' as well as 22 phones, three Sim cards and six chargers from the 60ft roof, contained in a total of 14 bubble-wrapped packages. Officers at the jail, privately run by controversial firm G4S, disclosed the haul in an internal document, which dramatically highlights the extent of drug use among the jail's 1,300 inmates. Dave Thompson, director of the Category B prison, said: 'These items were thrown over the prison walls by criminals on the outside and it required a cherry picker and staff to retrieve them from inaccessible rooftops.' Altcourse, the first prison in the UK to be designed and constructed for a private operator, has been criticised for drug-related violence. After a three-day visit last June, chief inspector of prisons Chris Hardwick wrote: 'There have been 38 serious assaults in just four months before the inspection. Gang issues and the availability of drugs, particularly new psychoactive substances [legal highs] were a significant factor in much of the violence.' G4S insists that Altcourse runs an effective anti-smuggling operation, and that the cherry picker is part of a 'high-visibility' approach to show inmates they will 'root out packages from anywhere'. 'We are committed to preventing drugs coming into our prison and we are encouraged that, at the same time as our seizures of banned substances have increased, the numbers of prisoners testing positive for them has come down,' said Mr Thompson.",

    "document": "Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Rescuers in Nepal have pulled a man from the wreckage of a building where he was stuck for a staggering 82 hours after the devastating earthquake that hit the country Saturday. His survival is unusual, as experts say it's rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster. The man, Rishi Khanal, was saved after a French search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of Kathmandu, the capital, around noon Tuesday, said Pushparam K.C., a spokesman for the Armed Police Force of Nepal. The team used specialized gear that detects signs of life, he said. But it took about 10 more hours for the French team and police officers to dig him out, the spokesman said. A police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach Khanal's location and then hauling him up through the hole. They then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher. On Wednesday afternoon, Khanal, 27, had just undergone surgery and was resting, surrounded by family and friends. He had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience. \"It seems he survived by sheer willpower,\" said Akhilesh Shrestha, a doctor who treated Khanal, according to the Reuters news agency. Khanal's story of survival isn't the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake, which has killed more than 5,000 people. A 4-month-old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of Bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck, the newspaper Kathmandu Today reported. A Nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard, the newspaper said. The little boy, whose name is Sonit Awal, was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries, according to initial examinations. CNN hasn't independently confirmed Sonit's rescue, but the newspaper published photos showing the dust-caked infant being lifted by Nepali soldiers in the ruined structure. Tanka Maya Sitoula, a 40-year-old mother of four, was at home in Kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city, bringing the five-story building down around her ground-floor apartment. She endured 36 long hours trapped in a room before an Indian rescue team freed her. She escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula says she remained confident she would survive amid the rubble. \"I heard people making noise outside, so I thought I would be rescued,\" she said, as she and her family sheltered on the grounds of a nearby school. What did she do for 36 hours? \"I was just lying down,\" she said. \"There was no room to move here and there.\" Sitoula's husband, Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. It took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived, he said. And it took another 18 hours to free her. Jon Keisi was buried for more than 60 hours under the wreckage of a seven-story building in Kathmandu that came tumbling down around him during the quake. Rescue workers flown in from Turkey had to help carve a tunnel deep into the debris to reach him. Encased in an orange stretcher, he was lifted to safety Tuesday. But he cried out in pain after his rescuers set him down, shaking his head from side to side. One of the hard-hat-wearing search team members that crowded around him called for water. Keisi was injured and dehydrated, but the rescuers said they were confident he would survive. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph reported from Kathmandu, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Moni Basu, Manesh Shrestha, Ivan Watson, Tim Hume and Pamela Boykoff contributed to this report.",

    "document": "The number plate that got Jeremy Clarkson and his former Top Gear colleagues harangued out of Argentina was a direct reference to the Falklands War, a judge has ruled. While the BBC claimed the plate, which read H982 FKL, was an 'unhappy coincidence', Maria Cristina Barrionuevo said they were deliberately 'provoking people' when they drove it through the country last year. In a report released earlier this week she slammed their actions as 'arrogant and disrespectful'. Scroll down for video A judge has ruled the controversial number plate that led to Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear colleagues being thrown out of Argentina was a deliberate reference to the 1982 Falklands War Clarkson and his colleagues fled the South American country last year when their convoy - which was led by a Porsche bearing the controversial number plate - came under attack. A village of Falklands War veterans targeted the team as they drove through Patagonia, with Clarkson claiming in one account that they stormed their hotel. They were accused of deliberately inciting conflict with the plate, an alleged reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Afterwards producers removed the plate and replaced it with another. Investigating whether this was illegal, Mrs Barrionuevo said: 'It should be understood that it is not up to me to investigate or evaluate the decision - arrogant and disrepectful to say the least - by the Top Gear production team to enter the country with one or more Malvinas-referenced number plates. 'Nor is it my job to gauge the reaction - anticipated - of citizens to such an offence. Clarkson (pictured this week) said an angry mob targeted the Top Gear team in their hotel. His producer, Andy Wilman (right), who announced his resignation on Wednesday, denied deliberately using the plate 'My responsibility is to analyse whether a crime has been committed under Argentinian law in relation to the removal from the Porsche of the original number plate H982 FKL and its replacement by another.' Concluding Top Gear chiefs had not acted in 'bad faith' in changing the plates and their hand was forced by 'massive government and popular pressure', she added: 'It led them to remove the original number plate and replace it with another which in principle wouldn't have negative connotations with the aim of ending the main focus of conflict and avoiding violent reactions by locals which indeed ended up taking place. 'The change was not done in a surreptitious way, but with the knowledge and approval of the presenters who participated in meetings with the programme producers.' Local prosecutors have already been informed of the decision and are understood to be preparing an appeal. Judges in the nearby city of Rio Grande - where Clarkson’s Porsche is thought to be in storage - are now expected to be asked to order Clarkson and his pals to be called in for a court grilling by overturning Mrs Barrionuevo's decision. The group's convoy was attacked as they drove through Patagonia. They abandoned the cars in Argentina to flee the country Clarkson, 55, and co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May fled Argentina with a police escort after being told to leave the country as angry Falklands War veterans threatened to kill him. They cut short filming for a Christmas special and took flew to the capital Buenos Aires before returning to Britain. Nearly 30 other members of the film crew were stoned as they headed for Chile by road and had to abandon Clarkson’s Porsche and the cars his co-hosts had driven on a 1,400-mike trip through southern Argentina. The number plate that sparked calls for a full criminal probe - HI VAE - was found on the battered Porsche which was attacked by a furious mob after it was left at the side of the road. A local councillor in Ushuaia later claimed the digits 269 on the number plate of the Ford Mustang Richard Hammond had driven were close to the 255 Britons killed during the war - and the numbers 646 on James May’s Lotus could be taken as a reference to the 649 Argentinian casualties. The furore sparked a diplomatic incident with Argentina’s ambassador Alicia Castro calling the H982 plate 'malicious mockery' of those who fought in the 1982 Falklands War. Andy Wilman, who this week announced he was resigning from the show, insisted it was 'completely untrue' the Clarkson car had been chosen for its number plate or that an alternative plate was substituted for the original one. Clarkson told the Argentinian ambassador she could 'go fooey' ahead of the screening of the Top Gear special last December. The presenters were filming a Christmas special in the South American country last year when the controversy erupted He is now rumoured to be working on a new car show format with Wilman which they are expected to take to a rival British TV channel, Netflix or Amazon. They were spotted in London on Thursday with Richard Hammond and James May, entering Clarkson’s home before leaving together for a drink at a local pub. Hammond, 45, has joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear following Clarkson's sacking, insisting yesterday/on Friday he had no plan to 'quit my mates.' Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. The incident led to the BBC deciding not to renew Clarkson’s contract after the current Top Gear series finishes. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would ‘not be pursuing the matter any further.’",

    "document": "(CNN)Recently, a New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook. What exactly is \"service of process\"? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go \"off the grid\". Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is \"nail and mail\" service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of \"service\" is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, \"traditional\" doesn't necessarily mean \"good.\"  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be \"liked\" by all your gawking \"friends,\" we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we \"live\" in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email.",

    "document": "Royal Bank of Scotland has racked up £50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers and warned last night that it faces another ‘tough year’. The state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a £446million loss for the first three months of the year. It comes after RBS was forced to put aside £856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided, including an extra £334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks. Down: RBS reposted a £446million loss in the first three months of the year In addition to fines in the US, the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the UK. RBS was also hit with a £453million restructuring charge, mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the US. The loss is a blow to taxpayers, who own 80 per cent of the bank, and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne, six days before the General Election. A return to profit for both RBS and state-backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008. Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector, but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the £46billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis. Disgraced former RBS boss  Fred Goodwin (pictured) was among those courted by former prime minister Tony Blair. Mr Goodwin was knighted for ‘services to banking’ in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 Chief executive Ross McEwan said: ‘This is going to be another tough year. There are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon. We look forward to the day we can focus entirely on the future rather than dealing with legacy issues.’ The latest news wiped more than £700million off the value of RBS as shares fell more than 3 per cent to 338.5p. The Tories have blamed the last Labour government for failing to keep the banks in check during its 13 years in power. The disgraced former boss of RBS, Fred Goodwin, was among those courted by former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Mr Goodwin – nicknamed Fred the Shred for his ruthless cost-cutting – was even knighted for ‘services to banking’ in 2004. He was stripped of his title in 2012. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘These losses are enormous and will unnerve taxpayers desperate to get rid of the liabilities for the troubled bank. ‘It’s clear that the banks were badly regulated and took extremely risky decisions that left taxpayers with extraordinary burdens, so it remains crucial that RBS gets back in the black as soon as is practically possible.’",

    "document": "Sleepy kid: Brock Guzman, 8, was last seen inside his parents silver 2001 Toyota Corolla. Authorities said the Northern California boy fell asleep in the backseat of the car and was kidnapped when the vehicle was stolen An eight-year-old boy who took a snooze in the backseat of his family's car, apparently slept through his own kidnapping after the car was stolen from in front of his home. Brock Guzman was found safe and well about two miles away from his Northern Californian home in the abandoned car following a frantic search for him. Police said a hapless car thief likely stole the 2001 Toyota Corolla after the boy's father left it running and briefly unattended in front of his home. But the car thief clearly didn't notice the boy curled up on the backseat fast asleep as he sped away with the vehicle. The boy's father said he had placed Brock in the Corolla at around 4:45 a.m., and started the engine. He then went back into the house in Fairfield to get some belongings and his older son, who attends school 40 miles away in Napa. However, when the father went back outside, the car was gone and an unfamiliar bicycle lay nearby. In a blind panic, he hopped into another family vehicle and sped off in search of the Corolla. The boy's mother frantically called 911, and authorities issued an Amber Alert. Less than four hours later, a resident called police and said the car was parked in their neighborhood. When officers cautiously approached it at around 8:15 a.m., the suspect was gone and Brock was still asleep. He was not injured. Fairfield police Officer Kathryn McCormick said: 'We don't know for sure if he slept through the whole thing, but it looks that way. We hope that was the case.' Police do not have a description of the suspect and say it appears that the thief did not know the child was sleeping in the backseat. 'At this point, we are investigating this as a crime of opportunity,' McCormick said. Car theft: According to police, a hapless thief likely stole the 2001 Toyota, similar to the model of car pictured here, after the boy's father left it running and briefly unattended and didn't notice him inside",

    "document": "A bruising training session involving 50 scrums is how Tom Wood’s Northampton prepared for Saturday’s top-of-the-table meeting with Saracens. The Champions have creaked in recent weeks and England flanker Wood, who claims Saints’ opponents have ‘smelt blood’, is desperate to re-gather the momentum that was lost following the exodus of key international players during the RBS 6 Nations. Defeats by Clermont and Exeter have done little to restore confidence but the East Midlands side are ready to address their mini-slump and breathe life back into the title push. Northampton flanker Tom Wood is keen for his side to regain their form following some recent poor results The Saints were dumped out of the Champions Cup quarter-finals as Clermont ran riot on their home turf ‘I don’t think anyone intentionally switches off, but the intensity of a Six Nations camp like that is very difficult to manage,’ said Wood. ‘Some people think you’re away at a five-star holiday resort but the pressure is real. It’s a couple of per cent across the board. ‘You might win it and be partying or you might have lost and come back with a lack of confidence. Then the guys who have stayed back in the trenches for Saints feel like the cavalry have arrived. In fact, the guys coming back are equally tired or even more so. It’s a combination of things and it’s difficult to manage. ‘Now there’s light at the end of the tunnel and we’re not far off full strength. It’s the home straight.’ Saturday’s showpiece fixture will be staged at stadiummk, rather than Franklin’s Gardens, and a record attendance is expected at the home of MK Dons. Northampton’s scrummaging pride was dented in the defeat by Exeter and, according to Wood, the players have paid the price with gruelling fitness sessions. ‘We’ve had to speak a few hard truths and take a good look at ourselves,’ said Wood. ‘Teams have smelt blood a little bit. The last couple of teams have really got into us and pressured us at the scrum, which is something we pride ourselves on. ‘When you give them an in, the fear factor goes all of a sudden and the reputation can dwindle quickly. We’ve got to plug that hole if we really want to be title challengers. You don’t win a Premiership without a strong scrum and set piece. Jim Mallinder's side have been boosted by the return of England lock Courtney Lawes ‘We’ve definitely been knocked off our rhythm but I don’t think we’ve played well for a long time. Winning can paper over a lot of problems and mask a lot of issues.’ But Saints’ season is still very much alive. They will almost guarantee a home play-off with victory while, in contrast, Harlequins campaign will be over if they lose to Sale. The west London club also felt the squeeze of the Six Nations and they must win at the AJ Bell Stadium to keep alive their slim hopes of Champions Cup qualification. Harlequins full back Ugo Monye (centre) is hanging up his boots at the end of the season For winger Ugo Monye, who lines up against Mark Cueto this afternoon as both players prepare to hang up their boots, it is the last chance to leave his childhood club with European rugby. ‘I’m not going to be here next season but I want to finish in the best possible way,’ said Monye. ‘It’s hard to get your head around 14 years coming to an end, because I’ve been here since I finished school and it’s all I’ve known. I might be locking horns with Mark Cueto, who’s also retiring, this weekend and it will be just as competitive as the first time I faced him.’ GLOUCESTER v NEWCASTLE (SATURDAY: Kingsholm, 3pm) Dan Robson and Billy Burns form a new half-back pairing for the hosts, in a reshuffled side led by Billy Twelvetrees. Will Welch and Ally Hogg return to the Newcastle back row after injury breaks. PREDICTION: Home win. LEICESTER V LONDON WELSH (SATURDAY: Welford Road, 3pm) England lock contender Graham Kitchener makes a first Tigers appearance since February, alongside Brad Thorn. Olly Barkley reclaims the Exiles’ No 10 shirt and ex-Leicester flanker Ben Pienaar also starts. PREDICTION: Home win.

A dramatic interview with a famed spiritual leader -- and the tearful reaction by one of his former students. These are some of the best videos of the week: In the 1980s and '90s -- before he moved to Vegas and started keeping tigers as pets -- former heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson lived in a Southington, Ohio, mansion. The home featured an indoor swimming pool, a marble-and-gold Jacuzzi (with mirrored ceiling, naturally) and an entertainment room large enough for small concerts. Tyson sold the house in 1999; it's due to become, of all things, a church. The video can be seen at the top of this story. Not a fan of roller coasters? You may want to skip the next video -- but for the rest of us, the thrill of watching is the next best thing to being there. The Fury 325 can be found at Carowinds amusement part in Charlotte, North Carolina. Watch the video: In a CNN exclusive, Alisyn Camerota looked into allegations that Bikram yoga creator Bikram Choudhury sexually assaulted six former students. \"He's a person who's based a lot of truths on a lot of lies,\" said Sarah Baughn, who alleges that Choudhury sexually assaulted her. Watch the video: CNN's Karl Penhaul spoke to a shepherd who witnessed the final seconds of Germanwings Flight 9525, which crashed in the French Alps last week. \"I saw the plane heading down along the valley and I said, 'My God, it's going to hit the mountain,' \" Jean Varrieras told Penhaul. \"I ducked my head. ...

Real Madrid travel to the Vicente Calderon for their quarter-final first-leg match on Tuesday, and Ancelotti admits facing Simeone is both an 'honour' and a 'problem'. Speaking at Monday's pre-match press conference, Ancelotti said: 'What can I say about Simeone? Carlo Ancelotti has hailed Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone as one of the best coaches in the world Simeone's Atleti side host rivals Real Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final first leg on Tuesday The Italian boss oversees Los Blancos training at the club's Valdebebas training ground on Monday 'He is a great coach, I like him a lot. He has proved himself, he is one of the best in the world. It’s an honour to face him and also a problem. 'We don’t have an obsession with Atletico, but with reaching the final of the Champions League. Our objective is not to beat Atletico, but to dream of winning the Champions League. 'Every match presents its own problem. Every match has its idea. Every defeat was different. One was due to set-pieces, one for something else, another due to a not very good attitude, like the last one. It’s difficult to say what happened. Ancelotti has a fully fit squad to choose from ahead of the derby Champions League clash Gareth Bale is available for selection once again after missing Madrid's 3-0 victory against Eibar on Saturday The Madrid players seemed in a relaxed mood during their final training session before Tuesday's match Cristiano Ronaldo shares a joke with Brazilian team-mate Marcelo during training 'It’s not that interesting, but we have analysed it and now we have another tie.' The 55-year-old also revealed he has a fully fit squad to choose from on Tuesday evening with Welsh attacker Gareth Bale set to return to the first team after missing Madrid's 3-0 victory against Eibar on Saturday. 'I am lucky to have the whole squad at my disposal. The formation will be the same as always. 'To play well, we will have to use all our weapons: individual quality and attacking directly with pace. 'Bale is fine. I have the whole squad available and they are very fresh. If one doesn’t play, another will. But Bale is at 100 per cent.' ‘Bale had a fantastic season last time and scored in both finals. We hope to play more finals over the coming months and he will be important, like last year,' he added. Meanwhile, Atletico’s Croatia forward Mario Mandzukic, who has scored five goals in eight Champions League appearances, has recovered from an ankle problem and is set to play, with Fernando Torres likely to be on the bench. Ronaldo will be hoping to add to his tally of eight Champions League goals so far this season The Portuguese star was in the mood to show off his stunning skills as Real prepared for the Madrid derby",

    "document": "Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after an evening in which their relegation into Sky Bet League One was marked by pre-match supporters' protests against Karl Oyston. Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen. 'We got off to a flyer and having got back to 1-1 I'm a little bit disappointed we didn't take anything on a horrible night on a horrible pitch.'",

Father Arron Cutugno said he was 'disgusted' by the choice to play music during the minutes silence Arron Cutugno, who was taking his young daughter to her first Anzac Day ceremony, described the decision to play music while the minute’s silence was being observed as ‘disgusting’. ‘Really enjoyed the service, everything was great until Ivy decided to start playing music three quarters of the way through the minute of silence,’ he told Channel Nine. ‘I can tell you there were at least a thousand people who looked straight up and were disgusted by it.\" Others have taken to social media to voice their furore, with a flurry of messages on Twitter taking the restaurant to task over the incident. A spokesperson for Merivale, which runs the Ivy, said the company was 'mortified and deeply upset' by the incident and offered unreserved apologies for the disturbance.

And like her apparent March 31 email mishap, her game show appearance ended with a very public mistake. McElroy, who teaches legal writing, got tripped up on the $12,500 level after flying through the first few questions, notes Philly.com. Wishes she was a millionaire: Drexel law profesor professor Lisa McElroy allegedly sent a link to a pornographic website to her students. In 2010, she appeared on the TV game show Who Wants to Be a Milionaire Mother of two: The mother of two shared an anecdote with then-host Meredith Vieira about having to scramble to find a babysitter for her kids and someone to teach her class after learning she was to appear on the show just two days before taping Lost it: McElroy was tripped up on the $12,500 question. Despite having used two lifelines, she answered wrong and walked away with around $5,000 The questions read: 'As a result of General Motor’s bankruptcy declaration in 2009, what foreign government became one of its largest shareholders?' Even after using two of her lifelines to narrow down the answer, McElroy answered China, which was incorrect. The correct answer was Canada. She walked away with around $5,000. McElroy, who is a children's book and biography author, is apparently also a mother. She opened the appearance by sharing an anecdote with Vieira about having to scramble to find a babysitter after being informed she was chosen to be on Millionaire jsut two days prior to taping.

The message read: 'As you may be aware, some students erroneously received an email this morning directing them to a... post that included some inappropriate material. 'We take this matter seriously and apologize for any upset it may have caused.' The university says federal law requires it investigate all reports of inappropriate behaviors of a sexual nature.

She adds that her favorites ways of relaxing include 'crawling under the covers with a dog or two and a really good book' or 'hanging out' with her two adolescent daughters. Regarding the recent email scandal, David Lat - a lawyer and legal commenter -suggests she could have been 'hacked' or made a 'copy/paste error'.

    "document": "A schoolboy with a rare illness which means he is allergic to sunlight has been racially abused in the street because of the brown suncream he has to wear. James Creag, 11, is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside. He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, whose victims are nicknamed 'real-life vampires' because their skin cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. James Creag must use the special brown suncream (pictured) as he suffers from a rare sunlight allergy He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, which means he suffers from terrible sunburn (pictured) when exposed to sunlight James, from Salford in Greater Manchester, was given Dundee Reflective Sunscreen, a thick brown paste which blocks out the light. But when strangers shouted out abuse such as 'chocolate face' and 'you're coloured' because of his unusual appearance, he refused to wear it any more. His mother Claire, 34, said: 'When he had the cream on he was called names - the kind of names a racist would say. I don't know why. 'It was either ignorance or evilness. People think he's different so they taunted him. It's so cruel. I hate that people take the mickey out of him. 'The cream was meant to protect him but he's stopped wearing it now.' The unfortunate schoolboy has to wear a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, and gloves in all weather so he is not harmed by the sun, which would be like having 'boiling water poured on him'. However, his condition can also can flare up when he is inside, so his parents have installed specially dimmed windows to block out the sun's rays. 'His school got new lightbulbs in October,' Mrs Creag said. 'Immediately he started getting pins and needles and his body swelled up. He was in agony, I was so worried. 'It turned out he was suffering a reaction to the new daylight bulb lights. The school put a special coating over them and now he is lots better. Family: James with his mother Claire and younger sister Grace, who does not have the condition EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation She added: 'He was first diagnosed when he was two. He was playing football in the garden with my husband, Daniel. 'But after half an hour outside, they came running towards me, James screaming. He said his hands hurt. They had swollen up so much they looked like boxing gloves. 'I put them under the cold tap and looked at him. His skin was red hot and burning. It was far worse than sunburn - his hands were three times the size.' The family visited their GP, who suggested that James might be allergic to grass. 'He was given steroid tablets to help with the swelling and we were sent away,' his mother said. 'But it kept happening and I took James to the doctors three times that week. 'Painkillers and allergy tablets didn't help. Every time he was outside, any exposed skin became red raw, his face and hands would swell up. He would scream in pain and no sun cream made any difference.' Eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition. 'We were told to wrap him up and use the special cream,' Mrs Creag added. 'So, even if it's overcast, James still wears a hat, scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin. The Dundee cream is so important.' She spoke of her joy at discovering that her daughter Grace had not inherited the illness despite the genetic risks - and paid tribute to James for his bravery. 'Even after all he's been through James is brilliant,' Mrs Creag said. 'He is your typical 11-year-old lad. Even when he is flaring up, he just shrugs his shoulders. I admire him. 'He always wears a hat too He just puts up with it though. He’s so brave and doesn’t let it get him down. Even though other kids can play football in the sunshine.' Mrs Creag continued: 'Doctors said his EPP was an inherited condition. Daniel had a variant gene, I had a mutant gene. So when I fell pregnant with Grace I was terrified she’d be born with EPP too. 'Luckily she wasn't.'",

    "document": "David Cameron will say that high taxes are 'immoral' as 14 million working households receive a tax cut David Cameron will say today that high taxes and wasteful government spending are ‘immoral’ as millions receive a tax cut. As 14million working households – more than nine in ten – are given an average boost of £200 a year to their incomes, the Prime Minister will set out the Conservative case for people keeping more of their own money – because they ‘know best’ how it should be spent. And he will make a bold argument for continued lower taxes, with less spent on ‘bureaucracy’ and ‘crackpot Government schemes’. ‘There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers’ money,’ he will say. ‘And we believe it’s people – not politicians – who know best how to spend their own money. And that’s what today is all about.’ He will add that it is ‘wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees’. Among the raft of changes coming into effect today, on what Mr Cameron will dub ‘money back Monday’, are: Other measures to encourage saving will also begin, with the Isa limit increasing to £15,240 and the 10p savings tax band abolished. Treasury analysis shows the changes will benefit 14million working households to the tune of £17 a month. And nearly million pensioner households – more than nine in ten – will benefit by £15 a month. Middle income households earning around £23,000 a year will benefit the most, and the top ten per cent of earners the least. Today will also see the abolition of the old pensions annuities, allowing retirement money to be accessed like a current account. Mr Cameron will say the changes make Britain a ‘better and fairer place to live’, adding that low taxes ‘go to the heart of what I believe as a Conservative. ‘For me, there’s the economic case: That, in a competitive world, we need to incentivise work by making it pay. ‘There’s the progressive case: That the best way to help with living standards is to let people keep more of the money they earn. ‘But above all, there is the moral case: That it is wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees.’ He will also pledge to eliminate the deficit ‘without reaching into working people’s pockets like Labour would’. However, in a speech in Yorkshire, Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes. And he will warn that the Conservatives will raise VAT. Mr Balls will say: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne are going round the country telling people they’ve never had it so good. How out of touch can they get? ‘The truth is millions are worse off because of this government’s choices. ‘And while millions are paying more, millionaires are paying less. Two years ago today they gave the top one per cent of earners in our country a £3billion a year tax cut.’ Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes The Lib Dems said that the changes to income tax had been part of their manifesto and said Labour would cost 24million taxpayers £340 a year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will say today: ‘In government, we secured a tax cut totalling £825 every year for millions of ordinary working people. We now plan to take this further, raising the [tax-free personal allowance] threshold to £12,500 and giving millions of people a further tax cut worth nearly £400.’",

    "document": "Riddick Bowe was once seen as the world's best heavyweight fighter and reportedly had $15million, but he is now offering to post tweets for $20 He was once the double heavyweight champion, with a career that allowed him to retire from the ring with a rumoured fortune of $15million. Now Riddick Bowe, of Maryland, has found himself tweeting happy birthday messages and adverts for insurance firms for anyone who pays him $20. The 46-year-old recently offered to 'tweet anything' for people who credit him through PayPal, sharing the messages with his 450,000 followers. His offer seems a far cry from the fame he enjoyed in the 1990s as the only man who could beat Evander Holyfield. Bowe explained his plan to this thousands of followers in a post. He said: 'I will tweet anything to anyone just paypal me $20 bowe@riddickbowe.com. Thats whats up. Bowe And as apparent proof of his pledge a number of bizarre messages have since appeared on the former boxing champion's Twitter account. One post read: 'I tell you all now @JakeLeeYes is twice the fighter I ever was. Thats whats up. Bowe' And in others he posted messages from people asking for dates and venting their frustrations at taxi drivers, as well as promoting websites, small businesses and hotels. He wrote: 'Im now in the business of endorsing yo companies helping those small business get off them ground Im try help the little guy thats what i do.' His actions seem a fall from his hey day in the 1990s when Bowe was widely regarded as the best heavyweight fighter in the world. He motched up victories over former champion Evander Holyfield in 1992 at Caesars Palace and Andrew Golota, who was disqualified for low blows. He retired in 1997 and went on to join the Marine Corps Reserves, but dropped out while he was training. Next the boxer's fortunes were to take an even more disastrous turn after he was imprisoned for 18 months for domestic violence after he held his now ex-wife and children against their will. In 2004 he returned to the ring and won three bouts in unconvincing fashion. Bowe posted a message to his 451,000 followers offering to post any messages they wanted, and his tweets since then - from asking for dates to promoting companies - has proved that he means his offer By 2005 Bowe had filed for bankruptcy - a stark contrast to the days when he was rumoured to have $15million career earnings. His last fight was a win over Gene Pukall in Germany in 2008. By 2009 he was at a New Jersey flea market, according to the New York Times, selling his wares and speaking of his aim to return to the ring. In 2013 Bowe made a comeback as a Muay Thai fighter, but was spectacularly beaten in the second round. At the time he said he had tried the sport because he was bored of retirement and needed the cash. Bowe (right) faced Evander Holyfield (left) in 1992 and became the first person to beat the undefeated boxer Bowe (left) is pictured in 2004, having beaten his opponent Marcus Rhode at Fire Lake Casino Oklahoma The boxing champion has a chequered history with Twitter - being forced to apologise last year after he posted a message saying he wanted all Liverpool fans to die. He later said his message was a joke, as a dedicated Everton fan. In the 1990s Bowe became renowned for his victory over Holyfield, who has suffered a similar loss of his fortune. Holyfield beat Bowe the following year in a rematch and also scored several victories over Mike Tyson. But most of Holyfield's £150million fortune has now gone, frittered away on gambling, funding three expensive divorces and maintenance payments for some of his 11 children.",

With the pair finalising their preparations for the fight at the MGM Grand on May 2, Top Rank promoter Arum told ESPN that the contracts have still not been finalised. Tickets for the bout have also yet to go on sale and Arum claimed that the draft contract he received on April 15 was not what he agreed with Mayweather Promotions and MGM when the term sheet was signed a few months ago. Bob Arum has revealed that the contracts for the mega fight next weekend have yet to be signed Top Rank boss Arum is promoter for Manny Pacquiao and he said the contract hasn't yet been signed 'We agreed that we would all be signatories on the final contract and then they sent us a draft of the agreement and it excluded us,' Arum said. Not being a signatory would mean that Top Rank wouldn't have control of decisions such as video content and music during the fight. 'They don't want us to have any say,' Arum added. 'That's what we're enmeshed in.'

He said: 'The bottom line is that Bob isn't willing to live with the agreement signed a couple months ago, which doesn't allow him to be in control.

Homes with the upmarket store nearby cost 12 per cent more – or £38,831 – than those in surrounding areas that weren’t near a branch. But having a budget store such as an Aldi or Lidl on your doorstep means your house could be worth thousands of pounds less than others in your neighbourhood. Homes with a Waitrose nearby cost 12 per cent more – or £38,831 – than those in surrounding areas that weren’t near a branch. But having a budget shop nearby means your house could sell for less In a study published today, Lloyds Bank investigated average house prices in postal districts that have chain supermarkets nearby, to see how they compared to the wider postal region. Houses in areas with a Waitrose cost an average of £354,378 – which was £38,831 (12 per cent) more than typical prices for their regions. Sainsbury’s also delivered a big boost to residents, as properties near the store were worth 10 per cent more (£24,506) than ones in the surrounding area that weren’t near a branch. The price of having a supermarket on your doorstep: Waitrose scores highest - and Aldi the lowest Tesco came in next, with a price premium of 8 per cent (£17,125), followed by Marks & Spencer, on 7 per cent (£18,786). But the presence of an Aldi nearby was associated with house prices that were 3 per cent (£5,910) lower compared to the wider postal region. And houses close to a Lidl cost 2 per cent (£4,719) less. 'It was mainly the views that attracted us to the property' Meanwhile houses near several different stores enjoyed the highest price premiums. Researchers found that homes in Clifton, Bristol – which enjoy access to a Waitrose, a Sainsbury’s and a Co-op – cost £392,961 on average. This is 64 per cent (£153,488) more than in nearby areas. And homes in Didsbury, a suburb in Manchester that boasts an Aldi, a Co-op and a Tesco, typically cost £239,595, which is 61 per cent or £91,096 more than houses in the surrounding area. Waitrose has carefully cultivated its upmarket image, proving popular with middle and high income families. But the research raises the question of whether a neighbourhood already had more expensive homes – encouraging the store to build a branch near its target customers – or if it was the store’s presence that boosted the area. Similarly, Aldi and Lidl, who have become popular as budget rivals to the big chains, have managed to keep prices low by locating branches in areas that were already cheaper, such as on the edge of towns.",

    "document": "John Carver has hit back at former Newcastle captain Michael Owen after he said they would lose every remaining match this season. The pundit has claimed his old club would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five. The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea. Newcastle manager John Carver is not happy with recent criticism aimed at his struggling side Carver has been left with a sour taste in his mouth following Michael Owen's recent relegation jibe Michael Owen captained the Newcastle side which was relegated to the Championship in 2009 Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley. But Carver says he does not listen to those who have never tried management, including Owen, who was relegated with Newcastle in 2009. ‘I could be nasty about Michael because let’s not forget what happened when he was here,’ said Carver. ‘But listen, I don’t have a problem with anyone having an opinion. Where I have the problem is with people who have never been in this situation - never been in my situation now. ‘They have never had to sit here and pick a team when you have got so many injuries, suspensions, or dealing with situations on the training ground or something from left field that you think, \"Where’s that come from?”.’ He added: ‘Let’s not start a war here because I accept that the likes of Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher have played hundreds of Premier League football matches and I haven’t. I understand that. ‘But sometimes there has to be a little bit of sympathy with the people doing this job. When you have never gone in and put your foot in the water and tested it, then it is a little different. ‘There are a lot of people out there who don’t do it because they can’t do it. ‘It’s easy talking with a tactics board and dobbers, but all of a sudden in this position you have to make a decision because your back four is not high enough and someone is causing you problems because of it. If you don’t see that during a game then you have a problem. People don’t see that.’ Carver, though, does have time for the likes of Graeme Souness and Peter Reid, the former managers of Newcastle and Sunderland respectively. ‘I never listened to Graeme when I was academy director here but what I will say is that he talks an awful lot of sense on the TV,’ said United’s head coach. ‘And when I see someone like Peter Reid on TV, who has been in this situation and has managed in this region, he understands what it feels like. I respect what he says.’ Newcastle ace Siem de Jong will be included on the substitutes' bench for his side's match against Swansea Meanwhile, Newcastle will include Siem de Jong on the bench for the first time since August. The £6million former Ajax skipper has suffered a torn thigh muscle and collapsed lung this season and has started just one Premier League game. But Carver said: ‘You can see what a talent Siem is. I remember watching him play against Man City in the Champions League. He scored two at the Etihad and I thought, “What a player he is”. ‘If I see anything like that then I will be delighted. He is a super lad and is a talented footballer. We just have to be patient with him.’ Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs Fans are unhappy at the club's lack of ambition, despite owner Ashley having £34million in the bank",

Rhodri Giggs, 37, revealed that he is now unemployed as he lost his licence after being found guilty of driving a Mercedes C200 without insurance. Under the 'totting-up' procedure, the former player-manager of non-league side Salford City, was forced to hand over his licence having already accrued six points from two previous speeding offences. Arriving for sentencing at Manchester Magistrates Court yesterday dressed in a black blazer and jeans, Giggs, of Salford said the offence on October 14 last year 'wasn't intentional'. But Eddie Coyle, prosecuting, said: 'On October 14 last year at around 9.30pm, he was driving a Mercedes along Hyde Road in Ardwick when he was brought to a stop by officers who performed checks and confirmed no insurance was in force.' After accepting his wrongdoing, Giggs was asked whether he would like to pursue an 'exceptional hardship' application in an attempt to retain his licence. He declined but added that he would permanently lose his job as an HGV driver with an agency and hadn't worked since December as he was waiting for the decision of the courts. Speaking for himself with no legal representation, he said: 'I work for an agency. If I lost my job I could get something else. 'I want to get this sorted today. I haven't worked since December and have no income or benefits.' Giggs was then banned from driving for six months, fined £110 and ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge and £85 costs.

Trials show Avastin, which is used in several other cancers, gives women around four months’ extra life. The drug plus chemotherapy has now been licensed by European regulators. Patients will have access via the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) until it is considered for routine NHS use. It has been available in England via the CDF since last March pending licensing. Scroll down for video Drug: Trials show Avastin, which is used in several other cancers, gives women about four months’ extra life Each year an estimated 600 women with advanced cervical cancer could benefit from Avastin, costing £3,370 for a month’s treatment. The drug’s use was accelerated by the US Food and Drug Administration which approved Avastin plus chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer in August 2014. Nearly 3,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the UK each year, and it kills around 1,000 women. Cervical cancer, which is cancer of the neck of the womb, is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under. It is treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and if diagnosed and treated early the outlook is good. However, for patients who are diagnosed when their cancer is at a more advanced stage it becomes more difficult to treat and a cure is unlikely. Reality TV star Jade Goody died in March 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease. The time between her diagnosis and death was just months, suggesting her cancer was already at an advanced stage on diagnosis and within five months it had spread. Cervical cancer: Reality TV star Jade Goody died in 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease Avastin, which is also known as bevacizumab and widely used in patients with bowel cancer, is the first new treatment since the chemotherapy drug topotecan was approved in 2006. Dr Mary McCormack, Consultant Clinical Oncologist at University College Hospital, said ‘Cervical cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in younger women. ‘For those women with metastatic disease (that has spread) or whose cancer recurs after surgery/chemoradiation there are very few treatment options. It is very welcome indeed that when Avastin is added to chemotherapy it prolongs survival by approximately four months. ‘For a young mother sitting in front of you with small children, or indeed any patient with cancer, that length of time can be extremely important.’ Robert Music, chief executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said ‘This regulatory decision for Avastin is positive news. To date, prognosis for women who receive a late-stage diagnosis of cervical cancer has often been poor. ‘Any additional time that can be provided through new drugs with limited impact on quality of life is extremely valuable to patients and their families.’ Trial findings show Avastin combined with chemotherapy can extend the lives of women with advanced cervical cancer by 26 per cent compared with chemotherapy alone. The drug, made by Switzerland-based drug makers Roche, led to overall survival of 17 months compared to 13 months. Avastin works by blocking the blood supply to the tumour, starving it of oxygen and nutrients. An independent blood supply is critical for a tumour to grow beyond 2mm and spread to other parts of the body.11 Tumours develop their own blood supply in a process called angiogenesis by releasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) – a key driver for tumour growth. Avastin is an antibody that precisely targets and inhibits VEGF.",

Scroll down for videos 2500 passengers on board the Carnival Spirit are at the mercy of the wild seas as storms batter the east coast - with the massive swell, seen from video images shot from on-board, showing just how treacherous and stomach churning the conditions are The cruise ship Carnival Spirit has been damaged outside Sydney Harbour this morning. Due to dock at 7:15 the ship is currently sitting off Sydney Heads. The ship has suffered damage in wild weather conditions off the NSW coast. The hand railing and pedestal lighting has been damaged while a cover over the satellite system (above) has also been damaged and removed for safety reasons The cyclonic winds battering Sydney have also caused drama for passengers on board cruise liner the Carnival Spirit which is heading south after being prevented from docking because of the heavy seas Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves The Carnival Spirit has 2500 passengers on board, stranded outside of Sydney Harbour because of the city's wild weather Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves, which began crashing into the ship late on Monday and have continued unabated, amid reports that there has been some damage. 'High winds have caused minor damage to some external features such as an equipment cover and some partitioning, while heavy rains have dampened some doorway carpets,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'This damage is superficial and has not affected the ship’s operation in any way. Guests and crew are safe and the Captain is ensuring guests are as comfortable as possible.' Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore and more passengers have been recounting their wild ride. 'It’s not pleasant, it’s been like this all night,' one woman told ABC radio. 'I don’t think many people got much sleep.' Carnival Cruise Lines officials confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that Carnival Spirit was scheduled to arrive 'early this morning' but was unable to do so because of the rough seas. 'The scheduled Sydney arrival of Carnival Cruise Lines’ Carnival Spirit has been delayed due to severe weather which has led to the closure of Sydney port and prevented the Harbour Pilot from boarding the ship,' the statement said. 'The ship is now waiting off the Sydney coast line until the port is re-opened.' And nothing can be done until conditions ease to allow the regulatory process to take place. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port,' Carnival Cruise Lines stated further. 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open.' Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore as the cruise ship Carnival Spirit remains stranded outside Sydney Harbour Waves of nine metres have been battering the ship for the past 24 hours. The Carnival Spirit remains stuck outside Sydney Heads due to the swell and may not be able to enter the harbour for 48 hours Carnival Cruise Liners in statement said: 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open' In a further statement placed on social media, to those travellers caught out by the drama, they said: 'We are sorry to announce that Carnival Spirit will be unable to sail from Sydney today as the port of Sydney has been closed due to extreme weather and ships are not permitted to enter Sydney Harbour.' 'For guests scheduled to depart for the South Pacific on S512, the Captain is working on a revised 7-day itinerary departing tomorrow, weather permitting. The revised itinerary will visit Isle of Pines and Noumea, but not the originally scheduled port of Mare.' The Ports Authority warned that passengers were in for some more discomfort, with little chance of the ship being able to dock on Tuesday, with the adverse weather conditions expected to worsen as another storm cell pushes into Sydney.",

    "document": "More than 20,000 foreign fighters have fled to Syria and Iraq, turning the region into an ‘international finishing school’ for jihadists, an alarming report found. Fighters from 100 nations – more than half the countries in the world – have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to research by the United Nations. Worryingly, the report warned if IS was defeated in the war-torn region then the barbarous foreign fighters could be scattered across the world. Scroll down for video More than 20,000 foreign fighters from more than half the countries in the world have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to a report by the United Nations The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with over 20,000 foreign fighters travelling to the region to fight for mainly IS but also the Al-Nusra Front. The panel said the thousands of foreign fighters who travelled to both countries are living and working in ‘a veritable “international finishing school” for extremists’ as was the case in Afghanistan in the 1990s. Afghan security forces estimated in March – three months after British troops withdrew - that about 6,500 foreign fighters were active in the country. And it said hundreds of foreigners are fighting in Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, around 100 in Somalia, and others in the Sahel countries in northern Africa, and in the Philippines. The panel of experts monitoring UN sanctions against Al-Qaeda said in the report that the scale of the problem has increased over the past three years and the flow of foreign fighters ‘is higher than it has ever been historically’. The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory The overall number of foreign terrorist fighters has ‘risen sharply from a few thousand ... a decade ago to more than 25,000 today,’ the panel said in the report to the UN Security Council. A military defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could have the unintended consequence of scattering foreign terrorist fighters across the world, the panel said. It noted that the ‘watch list’ in Turkey - a key crossing point to Syria and Iraq - now includes 12,500 individuals. And while governments are focusing on countering the threat from fighters returning home, the panel said it’s possible that some may be traumatised by what they saw and need psychological help. Others may be recruited by criminal networks. The number of countries the fighters come from has also risen dramatically from a small group in the 1990s to over 100 today, including some that have never had previous links with Al-Qaeda associated groups, the panel said. It cited the ‘high number’of foreign fighters from Tunisia, Morocco, France and Russia, the increase in fighters from the Maldives, Finland and Trinidad and Tobago, and the first fighters from some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with fighters mainly travelling to the region to fight for  IS but also the Al-Nusra Front (pictured, a fighter from the Al-Qaeda linked militant group) The panel said the fighters and their networks ‘pose an immediate and long-term threat’ and ‘an urgent global security problem’ that needs to be tackled on many fronts and has no easy solution. With globalised travel, it said, the chance of a person from any country becoming a victim of a foreign terrorist attack ‘is growing, particularly with attacks targeting hotels, public spaces and venues’. But the panel noted that a longstanding terrorist goal is ‘generating public panic’ and stressed that the response needs to ‘be measured, effective and proportionate.’ It said the most effective policy is to prevent the radicalization, recruitment and travel of would-be fighters. The panel noted that less than 10 per cent of basic information to identify foreign fighters has been put in global systems and called for greater intelligence sharing.",

    "document": "Manchester City may be still licking their wounds from their derby day mauling at bitter rivals Manchester United on Sunday, but the reigning Premier League champions looked in determined mood as they trained on Wednesday. Preparing for their weekend clash at home to West Ham United, Manuel Pellegrini's  stars were all in action at their Etihad Campus base. Fresh from scoring Premier League goals 99 and 100 in his City career,  striker Sergio Aguero was back to his menacing best as he took part in shooting practice against goalkeeper Joe Hart. Manchester City players were  trained on Wednesday ahead of their match on Sunday at home to West Ham City striker Sergio Aguero fine-tuned his finishing skills with some shooting practice at their Etihad Campus Yaya Toure (left) and Samir Nasri are reportedly two players who could leave the club in the summer Aguero, who signed a new five-year contract with the club in August, will certainly be one player who will remain at the Etihad next season. The same cannot necessarily be said for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri - who are reportedly two players  City are willing to listen to offers for in the summer. And the midfield duo looked out in the cold at one point during Wednesday's session as they appeared  as Nasri underwent some stretching exercises. In the aftermath of Sunday's defeat to United at Old Trafford, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Graeme Souness were highly critical of Toure. Of the 31-year-old, the latter said that he had become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Toure was criticised by Sky Sports' Gary Neville and Graeme Souness after City's loss at Manchester United 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why Both the Ivory Coast international and Nasri have come under criticism for recent displays on the pitch, but Pellegrini will still be calling on their services as they look to cement a top four finish this season. The 61-year-old's side currently sit fourth in the Premier League with seven games remaining - four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool and with a far greater goal difference too. City players' heads drop after conceding the fourth goal on Sunday to their cross-city rivals at Old Trafford",

    "document": "(CNN)Deputies rushed Kenneth Morgan Stancil III from court Thursday after the 20-year-old murder suspect swore at a judge and tried to flip over a table. Stancil is accused of killing an employee Monday at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina. Relatives have said victim Ron Lane was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported, and investigators are looking into whether the shooting was a hate crime. Authorities arrested Stancil after he was found sleeping on a Florida beach on Tuesday. Just a few minutes into Thursday's hearing on the first-degree murder charge he faces, Stancil snapped back at the judge after he was offered a court-appointed lawyer. \"No, I don't need one,\" said Stancil, who stood before the judge with his legs shackled and his arms handcuffed in front of him. \"You know what I'm saying? I knew I would get life anyway.\" Superior Court Judge Arnold O. Jones interjected, pointing out that the maximum sentence Stancil faces is the death penalty. \"Yes, I know that,\" Stancil fired back. \"But when I knew what I had to do and I knew when I got caught, you know, I knew in my mind that I could get life, I could get the death penalty. You know what I'm saying? Do you follow my topic? I would have killed you, you know what I'm saying, if you're a f---ing child molester.\" The judge told him not to swear. \"I don't give a f--- what you want,\" Stancil said, lunging forward and lifting up the table in front of him. Deputies quickly corralled him and hustled him from the courtroom. The hearing resumed about 25 minutes later, when Stancil was brought back into the courtroom, this time with his arms handcuffed behind him. When asked again by Jones whether he wanted a lawyer, his response was quick -- and calm. \"Yes, sir,\" he said. In an interview with CNN affiliate WRAL, Stancil described himself as a neo-Nazi and said he hates gay people \"with a passion.\" Stancil had worked for Lane, the school's print shop operator, as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March because of poor attendance, college officials said. During the interview, and during a court appearance in Florida on Tuesday, Stancil said Lane deserved to die, accusing him of being a child molester who'd made advances in online messages to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Lane's family has described those accusations as untrue and slanderous. His cousin, Steve Smith, told WRAL that Lane never made sexual advances toward children or anyone with whom he worked. He described him as a loving man who was dedicated to family and friends. \"Yes, Ron was gay. But people need to get over it,\" Smith said. \"That's between him and the Lord, him and his savior.\"",

King's dehydration was caused by his Type II diabetes, but he \"is much better,\" his daughter, Claudette King, told the Los Angeles Times. The legendary guitarist and vocalist released a statement thanking those who have expressed their concerns. \"I'm feeling much better and am leaving the hospital today,\" King said in a message Tuesday. Angela Moore, a publicist for Claudette King, said later in the day that he was back home resting and enjoying time with his grandchildren. \"He was struggling before, and he is a trouper,\" Moore said. \"He wasn't going to let his fans down.\" No more information on King's condition or where he was hospitalized was immediately available. B.B. is short for Blues Boy, part of the name he used as a Memphis disc jockey, the Beale Street Blues Boy. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and has 30 Grammy nominations. King, 89, has used various models of Gibson guitars over the years, and named each one of them Lucille. In the 1980s, Gibson officially dropped the model number on the guitar he used last and most.

    "document": "A Michigan father convicted of abusing his then-11-week-old daughter who might lose parental rights to his only child claims his baby was never abused. Joshua Quincy Burns, formerly of Brighton, was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse earlier this month. Joshua Burns and and his wife, Brenda Burns, say he is innocent, and that he grabbed their daughter Naomi's face when she slipped from his lap as he ended a phone call with his wife in March 2014. He claims he was trying to save her from hitting her head on a coffee table in their home. His now-one-year-old daughter suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages. But the couple call it 'an accident', not child abuse. Scroll down for video Joshua Burns (right) was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse after his daughter Naomi (in his arms) suffered several injuries. He and his wife Brenda Burns (left) maintain Joshua Burns's innocence Brenda Burns has refused to allow social workers and Michigan's Department of Human Services to see Naomi, according to the Livingston Daily. She was not charged criminally in the case, and a civil jury - when the state was seeking to end parental rights - found Brenda Burns not accountable for Naomi's injuries. The couple started a website called TornFamily in hopes of raising awareness of their situation and reunite their family. They will also be sharing their story on an episode of Dr Phil on Monday, and Joshua Burns maintains his innocence throughout the episode. 'I never abused my daughter,' he claims in the preview for the show. Joshua Burns claims he never abused little Naomi, and she suffered injuries after she slipped off his lap while he was ending a phone call with his wife and in an attempt to save his daughter from hitting her head on a coffee table he grabbed her by the face Brenda Burns (right) has fled from Michigan to Colorado with Naomi in an attempt to escape being watched by DHS. Their oversight has been put on hold until a June hearing where Joshua Burns's parental rights will be determined After the incident, baby Naomi suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages 'Then why are you in jail?' Dr Phil asks in return. Brenda Burns claims that a Child Protective Services worker and five police officers entered their home and searched her house when the incident occurred. 'I literally thought: Do you have the right family?' she said to Dr Phil. Brenda Burns's attorney Elizabeth Warner said that the mother has the right to not be monitored by the government, and 'certainly not by the agency that takes children' because she was not held responsible for the injuries and is seen as 'the fit parent' Earlier this month, Judge Miriam Cavanaugh said the DHS's supervision of Naomi would continue but is on hold pending the decision as to whether or not Joshua Burns will continue to have parental rights, according to the Free Press. Joshua Burns continues to claim he's innocent. In an episode of Dr Phil airing Monday, he says, 'I never abused my daughter' Even though her husband has been jailed, Brenda Burns supports her husband and agrees that the incident was 'an accident', not child abuse Brenda Burns fled to Colorado to avoid being watched DHS, which she believes is unconstitutional. Naomi's court-appointed attorney has reportedly seen the child and says told the Livingston County Circuit Court that the baby is doing well. Warner, Brenda Burns's attorney, said that Naomi is 'doing very well' and that 'she's pretty advanced for her age'. She said: 'You can see pictures of a sick child with tubes in them and think she's going to be brain damaged forever. 'In fact, if this was a misdiagnosis as we think it was, I think the fact Naomi is so well really supports the parents' position this wasn't abuse. It was a misdiagnoses by a doctor. 'It's something she recovered from.' The hearing over the potential termination of Joshua Burns's parental rights is in June.

    "document": "The Duchess of Cambridge is a modern-day suffragette who has done more to advance the cause of women than anyone else in recent years. Or so says actress Patsy Kensit, who made the comments in an interview with this week's Stylist magazine. Miss Kensit, 47, appeared in the magazine's regular 'Queen of Everything' feature and said the Duchess of Cambridge would be her 'regal inspiration'. Feminist icon: Patsy Kensit says the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette' Charity work: The Duchess is famous for philanthropy but not, until now, feminism She added: 'She's so fabulous on every level. She repeats outfits, which is brilliant. I know it's a shallow thing to say but I think it's done so much for women. 'I'm not going to be forced to have to look different every time I go out. She's like our generation's suffragette.' This is the first time that the Duchess, who spends much of her time doing charity work, has been lauded as a feminist icon. Although she has won plaudits for her dedication to children's charities such as The Art Room and Place2Be, her demure dress sense and closeness to her family has resulted in some criticism. Most recently, novelist Margaret Atwood revealed that she thinks Kate is an 'uneventful dresser' who is no match for Princess Diana. Suffragette: Emily Wilding Davison is pictured throwing herself in front of the King's horse in 1913 Votes for women: Campaigners lobbying for votes for women became known as suffragettes Critics: The Duchess was dubbed a 'machine made princess' by Hilary Mantel and 'drab' by Margaret Atwood ‘I think she’s watching her back,' continued the 75-year-old author. 'I think she probably has people who pretty much tell her what is appropriate for her to wear. 'I don’t think she’s become the fashion plate that Diana was, and I think she’s probably doing that advisably, wouldn’t you say?’ Miss Atwood isn't the only writer to criticise the Duchess, who is due to give birth to her second child later this month, in public. Double Booker Prize winner and Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel has described Kate as being like a ‘shop window mannequin’ and a ‘machine-made’ princess who has been ‘designed by committee’. Meanwhile Sandi Toksvig caused outrage when she said the Duchess doesn’t have a ‘single opinion’ of her own, while Joan Smith produced a similar storm by labelling Kate ‘unambitious and bland’.",

    "document": "(CNN)A new Kansas law banning a common second-term abortion procedure is the first of its kind in the United States. The law, signed by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback on Tuesday, bans what it describes as \"dismemberment abortion\" and defines as \"knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus.\" Supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step, while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur, but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy. The law allows for the procedure if \"necessary to protect the life or health of the mother,\" according to a statement on Brownback's website. On Twitter, Brownback, a Republican, said he was proud to sign a law \"protecting life at its most vulnerable stage.\" Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move, which it described as the latest in a series of \"extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability.\" \"Kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the U.S.,\" the advocacy group said in a Facebook post. Both sides appear to be prepared to take their battle over such measures to other states -- and to court. Carol Tobias, the president of National Right to Life, said in a statement that the Kansas law was the first of what her organization hopes \"will be many state laws.\" \"This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States,\" she said. Julie Burkhart,  CEO of Wichita-based South Wind Women's Center, said on Twitter that the signing of the law marked a sad day for Kansas and the United States. \"This law puts women at risk and ties doctors' hands,\" she said. \"We'll continue to fight!\" CNN's Sam Stringer contributed to this report.",

    "document": "An obscure agreement struck by state governments in 1993 means the vast majority of Australians will not get a day off this Anzac weekend. Under the pact, no public holiday is triggered when Anzac Day falls on a Saturday, as it does this year. The agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation. That makes Anzac Day the exception when it comes to public holidays. If Easter, Christmas, Australia Day, the Queen's Birthday or Labour Day fall on a weekend, a holiday is granted on a weekday. Scroll down for video Bosses in some states have been warned to expect a rise in employees calling in sick this Monday due to the lack of an Anzac Day public holiday But the rules do not apply to everyone, it seems. Western Australia and some public servants in Canberra have decided to go it alone and will get Monday off. The head of the Immgration Department declared Monday a public holiday for 8,500 staff, but other departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Defence will have to turn up to work. For the rest of the country, it's back to work on Monday. The decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert Paul Dundon warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel 'entitled' to the day off, reports Courier Mail. 'Employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off, Australians have an entitlement mentality,' said Mr Dundon, the boss of Direct Health Solutions. 'They're missing out and people want their fair share.' Mr Dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent-25 per cent rise in absenteeism on Monday 27. In turn, some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day, they risk losing their job. In Queensland alone, losses to businesses are estimated at more than $7.5 million if an expected 20,000 workers call in sick. The anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli has fallen on a Saturday this year, meaning all states but WA will miss out on holiday on Monday Australian state governments came together for a Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation. The reason was to avoid 'costs and disruption for business' that occurred when every state had different laws. The states agreed that when Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day fell on a weekend, a public holiday the next working day would be triggered. It was decided that a public holiday for Anzac Day would only be triggered if it fell on a Monday Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday would continue to be observed on the days set according to tradition across the nation. In NSW, the Greens called on Premier Mike Baird to give workers Monday off, claiming the government has the power to grant an additional holiday under the Public Holidays Act. But NSW Business Chamber chief officer Stephen Cartwright told The Sydney Morning Herald there is no need for another holiday. 'Anzac Day is a very special day for Australians as it commemorates the landings at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915, and we rightly pause and take time to reflect on that day, whatever day of the week it happens to fall on each year,' he said. Punters playing traditional Australian Anzac Day gambling game two-up: NSW Business Chamber officer Stephen Cartwright said there is no need for an additional holiday on for Anzac Day The last time Anzac Day fell on a Saturday was 2009, and before that in 1987, 1992 and 1998. A survey released last year by Direct Health Solutions found Australian employees took on average of 10 sick days per year. It estimated that Australia experiences an annual cost of $33 billion in lost productivity from sick days.",

Shocked Terry Cooper, 79, was enjoying the sunshine in his garden with his dog Sam when the huge animal burst through a hedge with two cubs. Mr Cooper, from Curry Rivel, Somerset said his dog  dragged him back indoors and fears he could have been attacked if his pet had not been there. Scroll down for video Shocked: Pensioner Terry Cooper said the huge badger burst through a hedge with two cubs (stock image) Mr Cooper spotted the huge badger while sitting in his garden in the sunshine with his Jack Russell Sam The retired charity worker said: 'I've got a little Jack Russell and I took him out just after tea at 5pm. 'Suddenly there was a badger and two little'uns in my garden. 'He was the size of a pig, with teeth about six inches long. They were as long as a lemonade bottle is wide.' 'My dog turned me round and quickly pulled me in,' Mr Cooper added. 'The badger didn't attack me, so I didn't seek medical attention, but I was left badly shaken. 'If I hadn't have had my dog there, the badger could have had me.' Following the scare, the National Farmers' Union has issued advice for residents on protecting their property from invading badgers (stock photo) He has covered the gap in his hedge with two pieces of metal and a bag of compost. Following the scare, the National Farmers' Union has issued advice for residents on protecting their property from invading badgers. Alex Stevens, South West regional policy advisor, said: 'Badgers are protected by law and people shouldn't be interfering with badgers or setts. 'This incident is really unusual and surprising, given the time at which it happened. But badgers are pretty headstrong. I suspect he was searching for an easy source of food. 'Badgers can squeeze through any gaps in fences or hedges which are bigger than 7.5 centimetres. So if you have fencing with the slats spaced more narrowly, that will help. 'Even better, people can protect their property through badger-proof fencing. This goes a foot or two into the ground so that badgers cannot tunnel underneath it. 'People should also keep the lids on their bins, and if they have a dog or a cat, don't leave their food or water bowls out in the open. 'If you do have to make contact with a badger, be sure to wash your hands afterwards.'",

    "document": "Three more political parties have vowed to teach lifesaving skills in schools, backing The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to add first aid to the curriculum. Charities last night welcomed the move to create a new generation of lifesavers, saying it could prevent hundreds of deaths every year. Previously, only the Liberal Democrats had promised to add the crucial lessons to the school curriculum. But last week Labour, Ukip and the Green Party added their support as they unveiled their Election manifestos. Three more political parties have backed The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to add first aid to the curriculum It means the Conservatives are the only major party not to make the same manifesto pledge. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham told The Mail on Sunday that the issue was ‘close to his heart’. He said: ‘One of my constituents, a very fit 16-year-old called Daniel Young, collapsed and died on the football pitch ten years ago. It really touched me – as a parent, the trauma of losing a child in those circumstances is incomprehensible. ‘Our manifesto pledge is about making sure all children are taught basic CPR skills before leaving school. We want to empower a generation of children, and potentially save hundreds of lives. This is about community resilience and people looking after each other.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham (pictured left) said the issue was ‘close to his heart’ The Mail on Sunday is campaigning to make sure all schools teach basic first-aid techniques. The skills can also be taught by older children to their younger peers. The campaign has support from Schools Minister David Laws, teachers, doctors and leading charities. Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan believes schools should not be forced to teach first-aid skills as part of an overcrowded curriculum However, Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insists that while first-aid skills are important, schools should not be forced to teach them as part of an overcrowded curriculum. She will instead modernise sex education lessons to include advice on ‘revenge porn’ and internet safety. St John Ambulance has launched a ‘promise portal’ to encourage all Election candidates to register their support for the campaign. Richard Fernandez, the charity’s head of public affairs, said: ‘We have been calling for first aid to be a compulsory part of the national curriculum, so that every child has the chance to learn to be a lifesaver. 'This is a policy that has had backing from individuals in all parties, but it has yet to become reality. ‘We’re delighted that Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Ukip and the Greens have now adopted this policy and included it in their General Election manifestos. 'We are continuing to call on all candidates from the other parties to give their individual support.’ For more information, visit thepromise.sja.org.uk.",

    "document": "Most people give up chocolate for Lent but one businesswoman decided to use her 40 days to change the lives of others - after almost losing her own. Triathlete Charlotte Roach, 26, from London, who nearly died in a horror crash, gave up ordinary clothes for Lent to raise money for the charity that saved her life. Along with her business partner Rosemary Pringle, 28, the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for London's Air Ambulance. Charlotte Roach and her business partner Rosemary Pringle dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the Air Ambulance Service which saved Charlotte after she was involved in car accident in 2010 The two women rated buskers in London's Trafalgar Square while dressed as Simon Cowell, rode the Tube as Baywatch lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas. Charlotte, co-founder of fitness company Rabble, owes the charity her life after a crash in November 2010 left her with punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebrae, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. The fitness fanatic had been out cycling near Melton in Leicestershire in a bid to make the 2012 Olympic triathlete team when her bike collided with a Land Rover. She said: 'When I went down, nobody on my team saw it, so they just assumed I'd taken a tumble and I'd be fine in a minute or two. 'Luckily, the car behind us was driven by a physio for Leicester Tigers' rugby team and she took a look at me. Charlotte continued: 'She could hear a gurgling sound when I spoke, which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs. Charlotte and Rosemary dressed up as Simon Cowell one day and rated performers in Leicester Square The two women larked about dressed as Reindeer in some shrubbery 'Effectively, I was drowning and I was running out of time to live. Her quick thinking probably saved my life.' Charlotte was airlifted to Royal Derby Hospital, where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death. She underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work. Doctors warned she may never walk again, but determined Charlotte worked hard at her rehabilitation. She said: 'In my head I thought as soon as I got home, it would all be okay, but when I got home I couldn't really move. 'I still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day. Charlotte (left) and Rosemary (right) wore a series of different costumes, here Rosemary is dressed as Harry Potter Charlotte said that the pair had a lot of different reactions, from laughter to confusion The former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not 'One day, despite my mum's protests, I decided to walk to the doctors. My neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as I couldn't bend down. 'I started walking but had to stop after around 400m. That's when it hit home how little I could do.' Following the accident, Charlotte, who had left university to train as a triathlete full time, was dropped by her former sponsors. 'I wanted to prove I could get back to where I used to be, fitness wise,' she said. 'The less people believed in me, the more determined I became. 'I later found out that, after the accident, doctors called my parents to say I may not survive. I think I was the only person who didn't think I was going to die.' Larking about on a Boris bike Charlotte dressed up as a clown Following her accident Charlotte was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine Slowly, Charlotte began to repair herself. While easing herself back into exercise, she stumbled upon the idea for Rabble, a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball. 'While I was recovering from my injuries I thought to myself: \"exercise as an adult really sucks.\" It can be repetitive, isolating and boring. 'I wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid.' It was the Rabble members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge. 'We were coming up with fun ideas of what to give up for a Lent. A few were chucked around but none really stuck,' said Charlotte. For this costume Charlotte joked about as she was dressed up as a robber The girls went about their daily lives whilst dressed in the costumes, including going to work and going to meetings 'Somebody suggested [giving up] clothes as a joke and at first I thought: 'that's the kind of thing that gets people arrested,' but then we decided to give up normal clothes instead. 'We forget we're wearing costumes until we get weird looks. People do react quite differently. Some laugh, and some almost look disgusted. It depends on the outfit as some aren't obviously fancy dress. 'Our most embarrassing moment so far was meeting with a big, corporate bank in our pyjamas. At first, they wouldn't even let us in the building.' In August 2012, Charlotte cycled 16,000 miles from Beijing to London, raising £10,000 for London's Air Ambulance. Now, she is keen to keep donating. 'I owe the Air Ambulance my life. I wouldn't have survived without them,' she said. 'At the very least I want to donate enough to save someone else life.' For this look they used toilet roll to turn themselves into mummies",

Blended into the background, these models are difficult to tell apart from their surroundings. Camouflaged in body paint, women pose for the camera against a backdrop of overgrown woodland. A series of pictures by German artist Jörg Düsterwald show body-painted models camouflaged in woodland In many of the pictures, the intricate detailing of the paint on the naked bodies means it is virtually impossible to determine where the person is. The jaw-dropping artwork is the brainchild of Jörg Düsterwald, a 49-year-old artist and bodypainter from Hameln, Germany. Jörg has been actively producing body art projects for the last 20 years and uses his body-painting skills in a range of creative projects including advertising, corporate events, and TV marketing campaigns. His work has featured in several art magazines and in 2008 he was awarded the German brush-painting champion at a national competition. The artist places the model next to a tree half-painted and then adds the details to make her blend into the environment Some of the models are so well camouflaged that it is impossible to work out where they are The artist is a well-renowned body painter who has used his skills in TV adverts The photoshoots, which take several hours to complete are heavily planned before the artist arrives at the location with the model. The pre-painted model is then placed against an item like a tree or a mossy log and then Jörg adds details that will help to camouflage her using his portable paint kit. As well as his recent forest shoot in Brullsen, Germany, which took place earlier this week, Jörg has also painted models into a number of other backdrops. They include mechanic garages, music shops and fishing ports. The women are required to lie still for long periods of time so that they can be painted into the background and the photographed Jörg has also painted models into a number of other backdrops, including  include mechanic garages, music shops and fishing ports.",

Matthew 24 is a Bible verse dealing with the end of times Fatal: One member of the Gaver family was killed in the shootout, now identified as Enoch Gaver. When police arrived on the scene, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to the Arizona DPS According to Facebook, the family is part of a band called 'Matthew 24 Now' (they are also go by 'Busking in the Son' back in Idaho). The name refers to a Biblical passage dealing with the end of times. The remaining members of the Gaver family have been jailed, including an 11-year-old and 15-year-old who were sent to a juvenile detention facility. On duty: Cottonwood Police Sgt Jeremy Daniels, 31 (pictured), was shot in the leg during the attack but is expected to make a full recovery. One of the suspects, David Gaver, was shot in the abdomen but has since been released from hospital The Arizona Department of Public Safety, who are investigating the shooting, said it was sparked when a few members of the Gaver family went into the Walmart to use the bathroom, and one of the store employees followed them into the restroom. At least one member of the Gaver family shoved the female employee, which led to the store calling 911. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days.

DPS spokesman Bart Graves says when the police arrived, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to AZ Central. Witness Louie Solano told KPHO that the fight 'looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot'. 'Lots of screams. Just screeching noise, like unreal, unreal,' Solano said. 'During the course of the fight, we believe there was a struggle for the officer's gun,' Graves said. That's when three shots were fired, though it's not clear who had the gun at that point. Sgt Daniels was shot in the leg, while David Gaver was hit in the abdomen. A Walmart employee who came to the aid of police suffered a sprained arm and cuts in the fight. Other officers were treated for lacerations, bruises and a twisted ankle.

The French forward suffered the injury during the Swans' 1-1 Premier League draw with Everton earlier this month and has been using his spell on the sidelines to spend time with his family in Lyon.

Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis has been recovering from his hamstring injury in France Gomis is put through his stretching exercises as he bids to play again in two to three weeks Gomis works on strengthening his muscle and has also been able to spend time with his family in Lyon The former Lyon striker took to Instagam on Thursday to share pictures of his recovery as he was put through various muscle building exercises to strengthen the injury. 'Working hard on my rehab to be in shape asap and at home with my family, it seems that things are going better,' Gomis wrote on Instagram. 'I hope that I can go back on the field soon. After all the effort nothing is better than the comfort provided by my little Dione.'

    "document": "Washington believes that the ‘special relationship’ between Britain and the US is over, according to a secret briefing document seen by The Mail on Sunday. The memo for members of Congress states damningly that ‘the UK may not be viewed as centrally relevant to the United States in all of the issues and relations considered a priority on the US agenda’. Dated April 2015 and drawn up to brief the Senate and House of Representatives on the impact of Britain’s General Election, the memo also warns that the UK faces turmoil if there is a hung parliament. Scroll down for video The 'special relationship' between Britain and the US was strong under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan The document – prepared by the Congressional Research Service, an in-house intelligence body that gives confidential analysis to legislators – states that while Britain and the US are likely to ‘remain key economic partners’, a ‘reassessment of the special relationship may be in order… because its geopolitical setting has been changing’. The memo, edited by Derek E Mix, the CRS’s chief European affairs analyst, says that the development of organisations such as the G20 group of major economies has led to a decline in the ‘influence and centrality of the relationship’. It also states that the UK’s continued importance to the US will hinge on the future success of the economy – and Chancellor George Osborne’s implementation of spending cuts. It reads: ‘A significant degree of the UK’s international influence flows from the success and dynamism of the British economy, further raising the stakes on whether the UK can sustain stronger economic growth while continuing to pursue ambitious fiscal consolidation.’ Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama serve food  during a Downing Street barbecue in May 2011. When Cameron visited the White House in January, he insisted the President had said the special relationship was ‘stronger than it has ever been’ Winston Churchill first coined the phrase 'special relationship' in a speech in 1944 The ‘special relationship’ has been deployed by generations of politicians – most notably Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher – to describe the close political, diplomatic, cultural, economic, military and historical relations between the two countries. It was first coined in a 1944 speech by Winston Churchill, when he said it was his ‘deepest conviction that unless Britain and the United States are joined in a special relationship… another destructive war will come to pass’. Increasingly, however, the relationship has come to be seen as one-sided, with British Prime Ministers more keen to flag up the alliance than US Presidents. When David Cameron visited the White House in January, he insisted the President had said the special relationship was ‘stronger than it has ever been’. The memo also expresses concern about a potential UK exit from the EU following an ‘Out’ vote in any referendum, saying: ‘Both the positive and the negative aspects of a prospective life outside the EU are more difficult to foresee.’ Explaining the significance of a hung parliament, the congressional document says it could result in a ‘brief period of ambiguity’ and ‘constitutional uncertainty’.",

Realising that its tongue is stuck to the frozen beef steak, the fly begins squirming in its attempts to break free Moving its legs, the fly at first attempts to walk away, before arching its back and trying with all its might to pull itself free. It tries this two more times, but much to its annoyance it stays attached to the beef steak as it stops to look at the camera. As the video goes on the fly tries harder and harder to set itself free – beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly. The fly tries hard to set itself free by beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly But nothing seems to work and as it slumps, looking sorry for itself, all appears to have been lost. Luckily for the fly however, help emerges in the form of a human thumb, which attempts to set it free with a little prod.

    "document": "Just one day after it was learned Bobby Flay had separated from his wife of 10 years, Law & Order: SVU star Stephanie March, the famous chef has filed for divorce. According to TMZ, the 50-year-old Food Network standout is 'heartbroken' about the split and his wife is 'mighty unhappy' with the prenup which is said to favor Bobby. Also on Friday the New York Daily News claimed the actress questioned her spouse about rumours he was romantically involved with Mad Men star January Jones in 2010. Scroll down for video... Done: Bobby Flay has filed for divorce from his wife of 10 years Stephanie March, TMZ reported on Friday; here the couple is pictured in June 2013 'I know Stephanie basically asked him after January Jones, \"Did you f*** her?\"' an insider told the site. March was said to be suspicious after her husband happened to be on the scene when single mother Jones got into a car accident in LA in 2010. The source added that he denied any romance. Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth. There was concern about this woman: The New York Daily News on Friday claimed that March asked her spouse if he had any romantic liaisons with January Jones - he allegedly said no; here Jones is pictured in March Her love interest these days: Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth Legal documents obtained by TMZ state that the marriage has 'broken down irretrievably.' It has been reported they separated three weeks ago. And because they have no children together there is no issue about child support but they are fighting over property already, it was alleged on Friday. He has already moved out of their New York City apartment. The couple has secured their own attorneys and are discussing the terms of divorce, according to the news site. Once so close: Flay and March, who reportedly separated three weeks ago,  pictured in January 2013 TMZ went on to report that the marriage began to unravel over the past year and a half. Sources told TMZ that the union crumbled when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day. Stephanie claimed, according to TMZ, that Bobby said 'he was busy with work' and instead sent his assistants to help her. Moved out: The Iron Chef Of America star - pictured in 2013 - is said to have moved out of the couple's New York City apartment Boiling point: The marriage suffered when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day because he was busy, TMZ reported; Flay was pictured with President Obama in 2009 In February, the pair didn't celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary together. According to TMZ, Bobby attended a wine festival in Florida with his assistants instead. This will be Stephanie's first divorce and a third for Flay, whose two previous marriages both ended in divorce. In January, Flay was rumoured to be romantically involved with fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis after the 44-year-old Giada At Home star announced her split from her husband of 11 years, Todd Thompson. The Iron Chef Of America star and Giada were spotted having 'a festive dinner out together' at Cecconi's, in the private Soho Beach House, in Miami Beach on December 27, 2014, as People reported. In a statement to Gossip Cop, Giada said that any suggestion of a romance was false. Bobby has a daughter Sophie with second wife Kate Connelly, who he wed in 1995 and divorced in 1999. His first wife is Debra Ponzek, who he wed in 1991 and split from in 1993.

    "document": "David Cameron this afternoon hit back at growing criticism over his election campaign – vowing to carry on warning about Labour's threat to the economy. The Prime Minister this morning faced the first serious criticism of the campaign so far, as Tory donors rounded on the party's lacklustre message and failure to pull away in the polls. But a defiant Mr Cameron this afternoon pledged to continue focussing on bread-and-butter issues like jobs, business and childcare. Scroll down for video David Cameron this afternoon hit back at growing criticism over his election campaign – vowing to carry on warning about Labour's threat to the economy He told supporters in Somerset: 'If you want political excitement. Go to Greece. If you want more showbiz in this election. Go to Hollywood. 'But here and now in the UK I'm focused on something real – a stronger economy.' Mr Cameron insisted the economy 'excites' millions of people. He said he would campaign on 'more jobs, more homes, more business, more childcare, more security in retirement'. He said: 'I make no apologies for focusing hard on that which is central to everything. When you get a new job, a new home, get a new childcare place or start a new business… now that's truly exiting. 'And you only get these things with a strong and stable government - not one held to ransom. That's not the excitement 'Britain needs. That's not a risk Britain should take.' Mr Cameron's remarks comes amid claims senior Tory figures are already planning to make Boris Johnson the next leader. Some MPs are prepared to engineer a coup against Mr Cameron in the days after May 7 by submitting letters of no-confidence in him and planning a 'mass show of support' for the London Mayor if the Tories lose, the Sunday Times reported. One major donor, who declined to be named, told the newspaper: 'Boris is the only one who can win. Everyone knows what is going to happen in 10 days' time. If Dave doesn't make it we'll get rid of him.' The Tories have nudged ahead in the polls with less than two weeks to go until polling day, but Tories are increasingly concerned it may be too little too late London Mayor Boris Johnson - appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, has distanced himself from claims that he is being lined up to replace David Cameron as Tory leader Multimillionaire Tory donor Peter Hall, who has given almost £600,000 to the Tory party since 2005, meanwhile has criticised Mr Cameron's 'curious lack of energy and belief in his campaign.' He said the PM needs to raise his game and 'unleash visceral passion and belief in his vision of the future', 'get down and dirty', as well as showing 'he cares', if he is to win on May 7. 'If we don't have a Conservative government after May 7 it will be because of David Cameron. His decision not to keep those Ukip people in the Tory tribe was a key error. 'I see no powerful vision of the future provided by David Cameron. There is no clear considered view of where we are headed.' Mr Hall warned that Cameron's mantra as a sound steward of the economy 'is not enough to win the votes needed to win the election' and added: 'Some people are really quite resigned to losing and they are planning the next step. 'It's a horrifying prospect if we were to lose. How can we lose when so much is at stake and when we have such a strong hand?'",

The preserved remains were discovered in a cardboard box by street cleaners in north-western Peru. The mummy, thought to date back to 1100 AD, was found wrapped in rope and dumped inside the box in front of an archaeological dig in the city of Trujillo. Scroll down for video Grim discovery: Street cleaners who found the remains initially feared they had stumbled across a murder victim It is thought to have been stolen from the archaeological site known as Chan Chan which was the capital of the Chimu Empire, an urban civilisation that appeared on the Peruvian coast around 1100 AD.

'Our suspicion is that someone tried to steal it and had maybe left it in the box to collect later.' The remains were taken to the regional Directorate of Culture for examination.

John Sims, who had Burkitt's Lymphoma died on Saturday, with his new wife Lindsey Sims by his side. The pair married March 21 at MD Anderson Cancer Center after John, who was to turn 31 tomorrow, was told his cancer, was terminal After the wedding they set off on a a cross-country road trip last week, hoping to make it to visit John's friend Dave in Oregon. 'We've driven through the mountains, we've been in snow. We've been in the Rocky Canyons, we've seen waterfalls,' said Lindsey, 29. But their journey came to an end when John's condition worsened and they had to go to a hospice in Grand Junction, Colorado. Their journey came to an end when John's condition worsened and they had to go to a hospice in Grand Junction, Colorado When John died his new wife sat by his side, holding his hand. 'This world will be a much sadder place without John in it,' Lindsey told KHOU11 News. 'The biggest thing that John would want to take away is that there is still love out there,' said Lindsey. Burkitt’s lymphoma is a relatively rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It affects  lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell - which are found in the blood and in lymph glands. Lymphoma is a disease where lymphocyte B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way. Patients with the cancer experience a swelling in the lymph nodes. If Burkitts lymphoma is in the chest or throat, people can have difficulty swallowing or breathing, whereas if it appears as a lump in the abdomen, it can cause pain, swelling, nausea and diarrhoea. 'Everyone deserves to be loved. You love selflessly, you love with everything you have and he's done that and I've done that and it's made for an incredible story. Something that I will cherish forever.' The pair, began dating in January 2013 after meeting online. But six months into their relationship, John was was diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma. It is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's immune system, made up of organs such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes. The rapidly growing cancer started in his leg, but had recently spread to his brain. But after being told the outlook was now bleak, the pair got married at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, where John was receiving treatment.

Twelve-year-old Alfie underwent a general anaesthetic for an MRI scan at the Animal Health Trust clinic in Newmarket, Suffolk. The pet, who is also completely deaf, had the scan, last month after his owner Lynne Edwards from Huntington in Cambridgeshire, noticed a lump behind his ear. Alfie's owner Lynne Edwards, said she only realised something was wrong with the pet when he started to refuse food and found puss oozing from his back But when Alfie returned from the clinic she realised something was wrong when he started refusing food and found puss oozing from his back. She then took him to a local vet, where staff clipped his fur and exposed the severe burns in his back. Ms Edwards, 64, then discovered that a pad used to keep her dog warm while he had the scan got too hot after it was heated in a microwave. She said: 'I just don't understand how it could have been taken from the microwave and then put directly onto Alfie without it being noticed how hot it was. King Charles Spaniel Alfie, who suffered three degree burns after vets place a heat pad on his back that had been warmed in a microwave 'They have told me that they always warm them up in microwave but after what happened they have promised to change their practice. 'I am glad that they’ve now said they will do that but it took nearly a week for them to stop the practice.' Alfie is now on medication while his wounds heal, but could face surgery to remove some of the skin around the burns. Ms Edwards, an interfaith minister, is now calling on all vets to ensure they heat up the pads correctly and monitor them adequately. The Animal Health Trust confirmed their vets are now using an incubator to heat the pads. A spokesman said: 'We pioneered the use of MRI in animals back in the 1990s and since then we have scanned more than 20,000 animals. 'In the last five years, around 3,000 of these patients would have had heat pads to maintain their body temperature. 'To the best of our knowledge, we have never seen anything like this before in any of the AHT’s patients. 'We understand how upsetting this situation must be for Lynne Edwards and her family, and have carried out a full investigation. 'We have reviewed, and are updating, our Standard Operating Procedure for the use of heat pads. 'We are also standardising the way in which all heat pads are heated at the AHT.'

    "document": "The country’s biggest food bank organisation yesterday claimed the number of people claiming free meal packages from its branches passed a million last year. The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as ‘shocking’ evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay, the so-called bedroom tax, and stopped benefits. But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers, which he said were ‘unverified’, and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work. The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a ‘political football’. The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks – said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming, and by critics to show that when free food is handed out, people will always come forward to take it. Yesterday’s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days’ worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604. Its UK director Adrian Curtis said: ‘Despite welcome signs of economic recovery, hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men, women and children. The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK.’ The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks, with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013-14, when there were 913,138 food bank visits. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust's figures are 'unverified' This figure was almost three times the 2012-13 level of 346,992. In 2009-10 the Trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits. The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three-day food packages, and not numbers of individuals. This means an unknown number make repeat visits, and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million. Research carried out by the Trust, Oxfam, the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks. It found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract. A chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise David Cameron over the figures. Labour’s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: ‘The shocking rise in the number of people relying on Trussell Trust food banks since 2010 shows the Tory plan is failing. ‘David Cameron’s failure to tackle low pay, the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid.’ TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘This should make all of us ashamed, particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery. It tells us that the Government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net. ‘Vicious sanctions and benefit cuts – even for those who paid in all their working lives – are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident.’ Oxfam poverty chief Rachael Orr said: ‘It is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the UK.’ The picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected US-based Social Progress Index published earlier this month, which put Britain in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger. Mr Duncan Smith said the Trust’s figures were ‘unverified’. He added: ‘We are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory – whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone. ‘The best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work – and we’ve got a strong record there: two million more people in work since the last election. Frances O'Grady, Trade Union Congress general secretary, pictured, described the figure as 'shameful' ‘It is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it.’ The Oxford Food Bank, which is independent of the Trussell Trust network, urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures. The organisation, which distributes food to other charities which provide meals, rather than handing it out to individuals, said: ‘We think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon – whereas food poverty is not. ‘As an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of Oxford, we adopt a non-political stance. To do anything else would risk disenfranchising a section of that support. ‘The issue of food banks and food poverty should not be used in a game of political football when the statistical evidence is so potentially misleading. We congratulate the Trussell Trust on the success of their operation but we also believe that successive governments have ignored the issue of waste in the food cycle. ‘It is high time the OFB model of food bank – which prevents food being wasted and combats food poverty – is encouraged and replicated elsewhere.’",

    "document": "The ethnic minority population in Britain will more than double by the middle of this century, meaning one in four Britons will be from black or minority groups by 2051, research shows. The huge rise will be due to a baby boom among Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and African immigrants who usually come to this country during their young, child bearing years. Campaigners fear that this sudden increase will put pressure on housing, schools and the NHS, and worsen the quality of life in Britain as a whole. A baby boom among ethnic minorities in the UK will see numbers rocket by the middle of the century, according to new data, with a quarter of Britons coming from a minority background by 2051 The research, carried out by Leeds University and reported in The Times, shows that overall, between 2011 and 2051, the UK's population will rise from 63.4 million to 77.4 million. While the number of white Britons will increase over that time, by almost three million, the minority population will increase more than three times faster, by 10 million. By the midpoint of the 21st century, minority ethnic communities will make up 24.3 per cent of the total population, compared with 12.8 per cent during the 2011 census. In contrast the proportion of whites will drop from 87.2 per cent in 2011 to 75.7 per cent in 2015. The sudden rise in the ethnic minority population marks an increase on predictions from the same university just five years ago. In an almost identical study, published in July 2010, professors at Leeds University predicted that ethnic minorities would make up around a fifth of the total population by 2051. In the same study they also predicted that British society would become much more integrated, with those from ethnic minorities moving into more affluent areas. Professor Philip Rees, who led the project, said: 'The ethnic makeup of UK's population is evolving significantly. 'Groups outside the White British majority are increasing in size and share, not just in the areas of initial migration, but throughout the country and our projections suggest that this trend is set to continue through to 2051. While the white British population will increase between now and 2051, the minority population will increase nearly three times as fast, meaning they will make up a greater share of the population 'At a regional level, ethnic minorities will shift out of deprived inner city areas to more affluent areas, which echoes the way white groups have migrated in the past. 'In particular black and Asian populations in the least deprived local authorities will increase significantly.' The new research is likely to cause anxiety for those pushing for greater control of British borders, including an in-out referendum on the EU, or a renegotiation of the open borders treaty. While the Conservatives pledged at the last election to cut net migration from 'the hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands', it now stands at just under 300,000 per year. While Cameron has promised a renegotiation of EU laws if reelected, followed by a referendum, the Tory manifesto only contains an 'ambition' to cut current migration. While Ed Miliband has admitted that Tony Blair's Labour government made mistakes on immigration, he has also failed to commit to targets, though he has insisted that all new migrants should be able to speak English. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan also announced yesterday that her department is conducting a review into the pressures that migrants put on schools. That echoes the concerns of researchers such as David Coleman, professor of demography at Oxford University, who said: 'Money of the consequences of large-scale migration are damaging. 'We do not need up to 13 million more people by the mid century. Almost all that increase will be immigrants and their children. It will not make the UK a happier or richer place. 'Crowding and congestion will have entirely negative effects, increasing pressure on schools, hospitals and particularly housing.'",

    "document": "In the aftermath of Sunday's derby disaster the talk among fans was of summer incomings to reboot a blue machine that, all-of-a-sudden, looks as outdated as a Commodore 64. Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain £38m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just £10m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of £200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.",

    "document": "A pub landlord who was convicted of drink driving after claiming he was sleepwalking and was not drunk has vowed to never drink again. James Boase, landlord of the Coppa Dolla pub in Broadhempston, Devon had been drinking with a friend in Torquay on March 13, 2014. The 36-year-old publican told Torquay Magistrates' Court that the last thing he could remember was going to bed at approximately 12.30am and then awoke beside his car which had been involved in a car crash. James Boase, pictured, failed to stop after hitting another car on March 13, 2014 near his Devon pub, pictured Mr Boase claimed that he went to bed around 12.30am and must have been sleep walking He insisted he had been 'sleep walking'. However prosecutors insisted he had failed to stop his black Nissan Navara after being involved in a collision with a Citroen Berlingo. Police arrived at Boase's house where they found him standing next to his car. He told the court: 'I remember being confused and slightly frustrated.I honestly don’t know how I got there. 'I remember seeing the car and being completely shocked. I believe I must have gone into my friend’s house and gone to bed. 'At the time I was unaware I had any sort of sleeping disorder. 'There were questions unanswered causing me a lot of problems, I was worried and scared and sought medical help to get some answers.' The court heard how Boase had 75 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, more than double the legal limit. At Torquay Magistrates' Court, District Judge Kevin Grey dismissed Boase’s claims of sleepwalking and found him guilty of drink-driving, failing to stop after an accident, failing to report an accident, and driving dangerously. Boase has been remanded on unconditional bail until May 12 for a pre-sentence report, and was disqualified from driving in the meantime. Boase, who has two previous convictions for drink-driving, said: 'My intention is never to drink again.'",

    "document": "Eight guards at Nauru detention centre have been suspended after they posted anti-Islamic messages on social media and were pictured with Pauline Hanson at a recent Reclaim Australia rally. Detention centre operator Transfield Services said the employees – who are part of Nauru's emergency response team - were found to be contravening a company policy that they display 'cultural sensitivity'. A former staffer at Transfield subcontractor Wilson Security said the guards – seven of whom are former Australian Defence personnel - 'frequently referred to asylum seekers in their care as \"the enemy\"', The Guardian Australia reported. Nauru guards pictured with Pauline Hanson at the Reclaim Australia rally in Brisbane earlier this month. From left: Dan Connors, Cody Allen, Alan Hartley, Beau James, Pauline Hanson, Graham Motley, Simon Scott, a man who does not work on Nauru, Jamie Scannell and Harley Levanic Some of the guards were found to have posted on their Facebook accounts promoting the controversial Reclaim Australia rallies – which were held around the country on April 4 to protest against Islamisation and the influence of 'minorities' and 'radical extremism' in Australia. All eight men were pictured posing with former federal MP Pauline Hanson – well known for her anti-immigration and anti-Halal stance - at the Brisbane Reclaim Australia event. In other social media posts some of the guards compared Muslims to Nazis while others accused companies with Halal-certified products of supporting terrorism. One guard, Harley Levanic, posted a picture to Facebook in February of a new neck tattoo bearing the word 'infidel' and tagged a number of other guards asking 'Who is next boys?' Another guard, Beau James, commented on the photo: 'Welcome to the gang… Well done old son. Looks awesome.' Harley Levanic posted an image of a new neck tattoo reading 'Infidel' with the caption 'Who is next boys?' Mr James appears in a Facebook photo wearing a T-shirt bearing the 'infidel' slogan, and on the day before the Reclaim Australia rally he commented on a post linking Muslims to Nazis with the comment 'See yas tomoz boys!!! Bring your pitch forks', the Guardian Australia reported. Fellow guard Simon Scott – whose Facebook profile has now been deleted – posted messages slamming companies for carrying Halal-certified products. 'Don't be UnAustralian and buy these products. Let the filthy sub human genetic Islamic filth have it,' he posted. Mr Scott also claimed that detention centres were '90% full of wealthy Iranians' in Facebook comments that have been deleted but still appear on Google search cache. And on a post detailing a plan to settle refugees bound for Australia in Cambodia, Mr Scott wrote: 'I don't care where they send them as long as they don't send them to Australia.' Fellow guard Simon Scott – whose Facebook profile has now been deleted – posted messages slamming companies for carrying Halal-certified products Alan Hartley shared a pro-military cartoon with a caption urging people to attend 'take back australia rallies' Alan Hartley shared a pro-military cartoon with the caption: 'This picture shows why we all have to go to the take australia back rallies around the country before we lose what guys like these sacrificed their lives for that islam and its muslim extremists are trying so hard to disrespect and destroy!!!!!!!!!! [sic]' Transfield Services spokesman David Jamieson said the guards had all made social media posts that breached company policy, in addition to being pictured with Pauline Hanson. 'It's not just the picture,' Mr Jamieson told Daily Mail Australia. 'What they are alleged to have done appears to contravene policies we have around acceptance of cultural diversity. 'These sorts of actions are totally unacceptable and we're very concerned. What is alleged to have been done is in no way representative of the broader workforce on Manus and Nauru.' Mr Jamieson said the men had been stood down while an investigation was being conducted, and he did not know how long it would take. When asked if the company now planned to monitor the social media accounts of other guards, Mr Jamieson said: 'I'm not going to comment on what we might or might not be doing.'

    "document": "A new sexual technique that aims to teach women how to 'expand the sweet spot' experienced during orgasm has swept into the UK. Orgasmic meditation, shortened to OM, is a practice that marries sex with mindfulness and, according to its founders, encourages 'connection, vitality and wellness' and 'cultivates a greater connection' between partners. The practice, which was founded by US entrepreneur Nicole Daedone, borrows much of its philosophy from yoga and meditation. Director of OneTaste, Justine Dawson (seated on the sofa), is shown guiding a couple through orgasmic meditation, which aims to teach couples how to enable women to orgasm more deeply Orgasmic meditation involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption According to teachers of OM, it involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption. The aim is not necessarily to orgasm but simply to 'feel' the sensation as intensely as possible. Usually practiced in pairs, there is a 'strokee' and a 'stroker'. OM-ing affects the same parts of the human brain as conventional meditation. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the US in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world. There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. There are also 30 dedicated orgasmic meditation centres across the globe. OM can be led in classes or with an individual trainer, if those attending desire a more private setting. In the classes, which cost £195 for a seven-hour session, attendees can be couples or singles. The director of the US company OneTaste, which has brought the sessions to the UK via affiliate company TurnON Britain, says the demographic on classes are surprisingly mixed. Justine Dawson told FEMAIL: 'All kinds of people come to the courses - people in their 20s through their 70s and even into their 80s. She continues: '[It's a mixture of] Singles and couples. Some couples who have been together for a year, others for 30 years. There are all kinds of professional backgrounds - doctors, teachers, programmers, managers, artists, therapists. 'I would say that most people are 25-55, 70 per cent are single, 30 per cent are couples. All who come share a common desire to experience greater connection in their lives.' Your average Brit might find the thought of disrobing in front of others for such an intimate encounter mortifying but Dawson believes that most people can get over the embarrassment if they feel they're gaining a valuable experience. She says: 'When it comes to discussions of orgasm, relationship and connection, I believe that most people are shy. 'But people come to the class regardless, because they know that good things take practice and just like your health or career, it's worth putting time and effort into your sex and relationships, even if it means being a little uncomfortable!' The aim of the £195 class is to help women prolong the 'sweet spot' when orgasming. There are currently 2,000 people  practicing the method in the UK, according to Turn On Britain Director of US company OneTaste, Justine Dawson, says her aspirations for the practice are that it becomes second nature to mention OM alongside yoga and meditation A video from a private class in London, led by Justine Dawson, shows a woman lying on a towel with a pillow behind her head. She is naked from the waist down and a partner sits on the floor by her side. Dawson, who's been teaching OM for eight years, explains: 'It's a 15 minute partner practice that two people can do together to increase connection, vitality, wellness and to cultivate a greater connection between them. 'A woman takes off her pants and lies down. Her partner sits next to her and lightly and deliberately strokes her clitoris for 15 minutes.' Dawson thinks the attraction for OM is that it offers a more conscious approach to sex and relationships. 'I believe there is a growing trend for the practice because our culture as a whole is ready for something different than the sex and relationships that have been \"on the menu\" up until now. She adds: 'We're ready for a different approach. One that is more conscious. People want information on how to do that. And we offer it openly.' Dawson also leads a team of teachers, holding monthly public sessions of up to 50 people in which couples are shown a demonstration, and then can partake themselves. She says she became an OM teacher out of personal interest: 'As someone who had practiced meditation for many years, I was looking for a wellness practice that would enhance my connection with a partner, while deepening my connection to myself. 'As many wellness practices are done in silence or even solitude, I was curious for one that instead could be done in connection, in a way that would enliven my relationships. I started with a class and it turned into my career, much to my surprise.' She hopes that one day OM will be mentioned in the same breath as yoga or meditation, saying: 'Our vision is that people could equally say yoga, meditation, orgasmic meditation.' Orgasmic meditation founder Nicole Daedone hails from California. Before focusing her attentions on orgasmic meditation, the author and entrepreneur was a University Instructor in Semantics and Gender Communication. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the USA in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world. There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. Vanity Fair named Daedone in its list of 'Twelve Women Who Changed the Way We Look at Sex' and around 900,000 people have viewed her  Ted talk, entitled Orgasm, the Cure for Hunger in Western Woman.",

Klopp, 47, announced earlier this week that he would end his seven-year stint at Borussia Dortmund when the current season draws to a close, prompting fresh speculation that he could head for the Premier League. Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past, is not in their sights, but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight. Jurgen Klopp has revealed he will be vacating his role as Borussia Dortmund boss at the end of the season Arsenal vice-captain Per Mertesacker says Klopp would be a top manager in the Premier League Klopp chats with Dortmund defender Erik Durm during a training session in Dortmund on Wednesday He said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge. 'But firstly, I wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements. Sometimes you can underestimate what it's like going straight into a new job. I think you should give him time - and I wish him all the best.' Klopp waves to the fans after Dortmund's Champions League game against Arsenal in November The German boss has enjoyed a huge amount of success at Dortmund and won the Bundesliga title twice But for all that a new challenge lies ahead for Klopp, Mertesacker admits he cannot work out what has gone wrong to prompt his exit from Borussia. He said: 'It is obviously sad news for Borussia Dortmund, [he was] such a passionate successful and passionate manager for them. He was the guy who turned it around at Dortmund. 'The whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge. It is a sad situation. 'But in the summer, it will be a new situation for him. Maybe he is going to go abroad and see how it goes there. 'I would love to see more German managers abroad, because it is obviously a new challenge, to adapt to the culture, the language, the system. Yes, why not? 'It is his decision. He worked really hard and pushed really hard, so even if he said he is not tired, maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries? 'But I am curious what happened to him because he was an outstanding figure in the Bundesliga in the last couple of years and always a title contender. They went to the Champions League final. It will be interesting to see what happens in the summer.' Klopp has been tipped to replace Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger but it remains unlikely",

    "document": "A man has died in a road accident in north west China - eight months after his brother was tragically killed in exactly the same spot. The man in his 50s, who has only been named as Mr Zhang, was travelling on his three-wheeled motorbike in Dezhou City in east China when he was hit by a car at a busy junction and thrown off his bike. Villagers from Shoma Ying said that his younger brother had been on the same junction last August, when a collision with a lorry killed him instantly, according to the People's Daily Online. Tragic: The man, only named as Mr Zhang, was thrown off his motorbike when he was hit by a car. He later died in hospital from his injuries Freak coincidence: His brother had died at the same junction eight months earlier after colliding with a lorry Mr Zhang, the elder of the two brothers, was taken to hospital for his injuries but died shortly after. The silver car that hit Mr Zhang on his motorbike when he pulled out of the junction sped away from the scene without stopping. A driver who witnessed the accident tried to chase after the car but eventually lost it in traffic. Mr Zhang, who was unmarried, sold vegetables at the local market and was believed to use the stretch of road on a daily basis. Leftover vegetables were found in the trailer after the accident, which was found 30 metres away from the crushed motorbike. Shu Rongli, a police officer from the Dezhou City Public Security Bureau, said that the newly constructed road was not open yet and did not even have road signs. Aftermath: The trailer of the motorbike was found 30 metres away from the main vehicle Poignant: Vegetables sold by Mr Zhang at the local market were found in the trailer after the crash He added that those using it were doing so illegally. The driver in the silver car, who was using a fake registration plate, is under investigation by the police. Shu said that those involved in the accident lacked road safety knowledge, and he reminded motorists to be careful at junctions. Investigation: The driver of the silver car that sped away from the scene is still being investigated by police",

    "document": "Jermain Defoe says his stunning Wear-Tyne derby winner is justification for his decision to quit MLS and return to the Premier League. The former FC Toronto striker had scored just twice for struggling Sunderland since arriving on £80,000-per-week wages in January. But Defoe was the hero on Sunday as his 20-yard volley proved enough to secure a fifth straight victory for the Black Cats over Newcastle. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe believes his stunning volley against Newcastle has proven his worth Defoe's superb first-half strike was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Sunderland in the Wear-Tyne derby Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was completely helpless as Defoe's shot found its way into the top corner The 32-year-old was overcome with emotion in the wake of his brilliant blast, and admits the joy it brought to a sold-out Stadium of Light was too much to take in. 'I have said many times that I missed the Premier League and it's because of games like this,' he said. 'Games like this are why I came back. Being at a club like this, they just love football. I was told before that if I come here and work hard and score goals, they won't ask for anything more. 'And I just love scoring goals, the fans deserved it. It's been really difficult for them in the last few weeks but they always turn out. 'It was the whole occasion really that got to me. It was great to be the person that made so many people happy. I was just thinking, 'Why me?'. 'As the whistle went for half-time and as I was walking down the tunnel I thought, 'I'm crying and I'm on the telly', but I didn't care. For the fans and everyone it was just a special day.' The victory was the first of Dick Advocaat's reign and moved Sunderland up to 15th. Defoe has compared the feeling of scoring the winner against Newcastle to scoring at the World Cup Defoe added: 'The manager said to use beforehand that we were lucky to be playing in a game like this. 'There are so many young kids who wish they could play in a game like this. To be blessed enough and to score the winner is amazing. 'Going on the bus towards the game and seeing everyone outside the hotel, wanting autographs and pictures, there were so many fans there that I felt, 'Wow, this is a massive game'. 'When I scored I got that same feeling as when I scored in the World Cup. I missed the World Cup in 2006 when I felt in my heart I should have gone. 'It hurt me when I didn't go but I went to the next one and when I got the goal (against Slovenia) I was emotional. 'That was scoring in a World Cup for your country. It was the same on Sunday.'

    "document": "Guilty: Glenn Mason, 56, has said he will pay back the whole £185,000 out of his RBS pension pot A respected NatWest bank manager who was jailed for stealing £185,000 from his elderly customers to fund his internet gambling addiction will have to pay back every penny. Glenn Mason, 56, plundered the accounts of nine pensioners including an 83 year-old woman and a 92 year-old man living near his branch in Biggin Hill, Kent, the Old Bailey heard. Mason, who was given an award by the Metropolitan Police in Bromley in 2009 for his crime fighting efforts, got away with the thefts for almost a year before his arrest in July 2012. His attempts to cover up his crime by transferring money using the identity of two of his colleagues, Julie Jeffrey, 50, and James Cato, 35, led to them being sacked and charged with fraud. It was only when Mason pleaded guilty in September that the case against them was dropped at the Old Bailey. Mason, who was jailed for 15 months in November last year, has said he will pay back the whole £185,000 out of his RBS pension pot. The bank has already refunded the customers targeted by Mason, and will receive the money as compensation. ‘The benefit was £185,000 and the recoverable amount is greater than that so the available amount will be the same’, said prosecutor David Hughes. ‘The loser here ultimately was RBS - they had to reimburse the account holders.’ Mr Hughes said the bank had started civil proceedings against Mason, as well as the compensation claim that comes after a criminal conviction. ‘If he makes a payment from his pension pot to RBS then that would deal with these proceedings and they would come to an end.’ Mason, who sobbed in the dock as he was jailed, did not appear in court for today’s hearing. Judge Stephen Kramer QC will confirm the money has been paid at a short hearing on May 15. At his sentencing hearing, Andrew Lawson, representing Mason, said the bank manager turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting with British troops in Afghanistan. Mr Lawson said that all of the stolen money was paid into his gambling account and told the court: ‘It was late night poker and online games that are designed to tempt you into spending money in the hope of a big win.’ The court also heard statements from two of Mason’s victims, Julie Amos and Leslie Pilditch, who both said they no longer felt able to trust banks. Julie Jeffrey also described how she lost her job after her arrest and added: ‘I no longer feel proud, my life has fallen apart.’ Mason's actions took place at Natwest in Biggin Hill (pictured). The bank manager was said to have turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting  in Afghanistan Elaine May, the current manager of the NatWest Biggin Hill branch, also said in a statement that the thefts had ‘an ongoing impact within the community’ and put strain upon the staff. Mason continues to live in the area with his wife and son and has been working in a local newsagents. The judge, Mr Recorder Simon Farrell QC, told him: ‘You stole roughly £185,000 over a period of a year from nine victims who were all elderly and undoubtedly vulnerable. ‘Your fellow worker Julie Jeffrey, who was falsely arrested because you used her ID details to steal the money, described how, having worked for NatWest since the age of 16, losing her job as a 50 year-old woman and being reduced to delivery leaflets in all weathers. ‘Plainly these are very serious offences which everyone agrees cross the custody threshold. ‘You are of previous good character and someone who has suffered considerable personal tragedy. ‘Your wife suffered from cancer in 2005 and your son at only 19 went to Afghanistan to fight for his country and was the victim of an improvised explosive device that caused him very serious injury. ‘I accept this caused you to develop a serious gambling addiction which was in fact the root cause of stealing the money from customers. ‘In my judgement I am afraid these matters are so serious that I am not able to suspend the sentence. The best I can do is to pass a sentence of 15 months imprisonment. But for your personal mitigation this sentence would have been far longer.’ Mason, of Flamborough Close, Biggin Hill, pleaded guilty to a single charge of fraud. The case against Jeffrey, of Court Road, Orpington, Kent, and Cato, of Robert Street, Plumstead, south London, was discontinued by the prosecution.",

    "document": "Injury-ravaged Bayern Munich beat Hoffenheim 2-0 on Saturday, shrugging off a string of absences and their midweek Champions League defeat at Porto to close in on the Bundesliga title. Sebastian Rode scored in the 38th minute and Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck added an own goal in stoppage time as Bayern, with youngsters Mitchell Weiser and Gianluca Gaudino in the lineup, opened a 13-point lead over second-placed VfL Wolfsburg, in action against Schalke 04 on Sunday, with five matches left. The German champions, who host Porto on Tuesday in the Champions League quarter-final second leg after Wednesday's 3-1 loss, were without half a dozen starters, including Philipp Lahm, Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Thomas Muller celebrates after Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck scored a stoppage time own goal But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was in top form, spectacularly denying Anthony Modeste at point blank range after a defensive blunder by Brazilian Dante. Rode then made the most of Bayern's second chance of the game, curling his shot from the edge of the box past keeper Oliver Baumann. Rode was lucky not to be penalised for bringing down Eugen Polanski in the area a minute later but there was no denying the dominance of Bayern, who came close again when Robert Lewandowski scraped the bar at the start of the second-half. They did get a second goal when Thomas Mueller charged into the box and cut the ball back to the unfortunate Hoffenheim captain Beck who slipped the ball into his own net.

    "document": "They played in grey and duly put in a dull and uninspired performance, these really are dark days for Newcastle United. Still, at least they returned a club record profit of £18.7million last week and retail gain was probably behind the bizarre decision to ditch their black-and-white stripes. But on Sunday they set another record as losers of the last five Tyne-Wear derbies. John Carver looks on as his Newcastle United struggle against rivals Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby Head coach John Carver said before the game he had a secret motivational tactic up his sleeve and would only reveal what it was following victory. Well, we'll never know what he used in a forlorn attempt to rouse his players. But we do know it didn't work. Phil Neville was scathing in his assessment of Newcastle a fortnight ago when he said that their application during the 3-0 defeat at Everton was reminiscent of a set of players with one eye on their summer holidays. Neville was at the Stadium of Light on Sunday and, rather than prove him wrong as a livid Carver promised his men would, they played like a side with their flip-flops on. Carver was in a rage again on Sunday night, but this time it was his players feeling the fury. 'I said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not working hard enough. I was wrong,' he said. Jordi Gomez and Remy Cabella do battle on the Stadium of Light pitch as Sunderland snatch victory 'The performance hurts more than the result. We were second best. It's a funny thing pressure, some players can handle it and some can't. Some of ours perhaps can't after losing five in a row. 'I am absolutely embarrassed to be part of it.' Newcastle's problem is a sad attitude of acceptance that has been allowed to permeate a squad lacking in ability and character. The Magpie mandate is survival and, to that end, their season finished the minute they were more or less assured of as much. Not even a derby can rally this lot. There was one incident in the second half which captured their passive approach. With the play dead, Mike Williamson had to scream at team-mate Daryl Janmaat in a desperate effort to return the ball with some sense of urgency. Sunderland, in contrast, hassled, harried and hounded their opponents. They had won the previous four derbies because they out-worked Newcastle and wanted it more. They won a fifth for exactly the same reasons. Jermain Defoe earns Sunderland all three points with a sensational volley at the Stadium of Light This was billed as 'The Desperation Derby' given the alarming form of the North-East rivals going into the game – four goals between them in 18 hours with six points taken from a possible 36. But there was only one team desperate to win this. It wasn't until the final 15 minutes that Newcastle drew a save from Costel Pantilimon. But it was too little, too late. Far too little, in fact. These are dispiriting times on Tyneside. The disconnect between supporters, players and hierarchy has never been greater. On full-time, the Toon Army spat as much venom towards their own team as they did the red-and-whites goading them nearby. They had just witnessed a dour display of nothingness, sadly lacking in energy, imagination and pride. Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul can only look on in horror as the striker's effort cruises in There was one shining light amid the darkness. Cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez was starting his first game in 20 months and was by some distance the only player in grey worthy of applause, and that he rightly received. His shirt was soaked near-enough black come the end such was his effort. It failed, however, to inspire his team-mates, one of which, Tim Krul, was criticised by fans on social media when it appeared he congratulated Jermain Defoe for his stunning match-winner shortly before half-time. But to demonise Krul alone would be wrong. The problems at Newcastle run from top to bottom. They are a club without ambition, happy to renew their Premier League pay packet come the end of the season. That message from above means you end up with performances such as this – grey, with little sign of light. January signing Defoe reels away in celebration after scoring a priceless goal for Sunderland Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat (left) celebrates Defoe's opening goal as Newcastle manager The Sunderland player closed down quickly throughout as Newcastle players struggled to get going Cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez (left) was by some distance the only player in grey worthy of applause",

    "document": "A stunning new series of photographs of the late artist Frida Kahlo have been released as part of a new book. In the images, which are featured in Frida Kahlo: The Gisèle Freund Photographs, the formidable painter is seen at her most relaxed, walking around her house in Mexico. The pictures portray the artist in her garden or languishing in her bed, giving an unparralled insight into her life with many of the pictures taken in the years before her death in 1954. Scroll down for video In the beautiful new pictures by Gisèle Freund the late artist Frida is seen at her most intimate, her she is pictured standing in her garden in Mexico Beautiful Frida poses in her house (left), in one picture she is seen lying in bed surrounded by books (right) Frida, whose real name was Frida Kahlo de Rivera, was a painter who was best known for her self portraits. These images were strong and she has become  a feminist icon for her striking and unapologetic style, her monobrow and signature, colourful outfits inspired by traditional Mexican  costume. The new  photographs were taken by Gisèle Freund, a German-born French photographer, who had travelled to Mexico in 1950. Having initially only planned to stay for two weeks she ended up staying for two years after becoming friends with Frida and her husband, artist Diego Rivera. Friday looks happy and relaxed here as she reclines on her sofa in a high necked shirt Frida Kahlo and Dr Juan Farill photographed in her home, 1951, they are standing in front of one of Frida's paintings that was done of the pair Frida Kahlo: The Gisèle Freund Photographs Photographs by Gisèle Freund Texts by Gérard de Cortanze, Gisèle Freund, and Lorraine Audric Published by Abrams Gisele lived with the couple and began taking many photographs of the pair as they went about their daily lives. In the introduction to the book, Cortanze quotes Freund's impressions of Kahlo which she had told to Rauda Jamis who wrote a book about the artist. She is said to have said: 'She was a formidable being, but in great distress … not only because of the physical pain due to her terrible tram accident but because she was a deeply conflicted being. 'She loved men, but did not turn away from women. She would shower you with gifts large and small, ranging from a charm, a tiny brass ex-voto, or a good luck stone to pre-Columbian pottery, as well as the heavy jewelry that she was crazy about … 'One day she told me: I don't want to live a long time. I am really suffering too much.' Frida spent much of her life in pain after a tram accident in 1925. Then a young woman she suffered serious injuries after the vehicle that she was riding in collided with a trolley car. These included damage to her spinal column, a broken collarbone, broken ribs, a broken pelvis, 11 fractures in her right leg, a crushed and dislocated right foot, and a dislocated shoulder. It was the accident which forced her to focus on her painting and give up a potential career in medicine which she had been studying. Kahlo painted to pass the time while she was stuck in bed during the time following the accident. She passed away at just 47 and it is reported that her marriage to Diego was a tumultuous. It is thought that both of them enjoyed extra-marital affairs with Diego angering his wife when he had a relationship with her sister. They divorced in 1939, however, they were back together again by 1940. For all of Frida's hard work though it wasn't really until after her death that her work began to gain world-wide recognition and over the years her pieces have been displayed around the world. Her unique look has also previously been emulated by many celebrities. The singer Beyonce once dressed up as Frida. Whilst in the artwork for her latest single 'B**** better have my money' she seems to have copied the artist's eyebrows. Some of the photographs show the inside of Frida's house, some of the walls of which were covered in pictures (left) she also kept dolls on her fireplace (right) There were many interesting artefacts in Frida's house including this turtle which was tucked away under a table Frida stands in the grounds of her gardens, her pose striking against the flora and fauna Frida stands in her garden a long shawl drapped elegantly around her shoulders",

    "document": "Accused: Dr Ram Manohar, 38, of Barnston, Wirral, has denied four counts of sexual assault A senior doctor facing sexual assault allegations from two separate nurses is accused of groping the breast of one of them and saying 'you bad girl' after smacking her on the bottom. A&E consultant Dr Ram Manohar, 38, is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. David McLachlan, prosecuting, said Manohar offered to help Nurse A with her training on December 23, 2013, Liverpool Crown Court heard. He said she knew Manohar and, while in his room, asked for his help to learn about matters including chest X-rays. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any warning Ram Manohar put his hand down her nurse's dress and he put his hands into her bra.' She said he moved his hand around but she had not asked for a demonstration. Nurse A said he later asked her a question about the heart, which she got wrong. She said: 'He smacked me on the bottom quite hard and said to me, \"you bad girl\".' Mr McLachlan said Manohar squeezed her left breast to indicate where her left ventricle was and while discussing breast lumps asked to see her nipple, but she refused. She said the conversation moved onto the femoral pulse. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any word of warning he put his hand up her dress and down her tights.' Manohar then allegedly touched her inappropriately. Nurse A said he told her 'this type of teaching is only for you' before she left the room 'feeling disgusted with herself'. She later told friends she felt 'violated' before contacting police. Manohar told officers he had known her since working with her at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. He said after a night out she had asked him back to her house, but he had refused. He said she had also asked him on December 12 'to find her a single and smart man because she was desperate'. Manohar said on December 23 she unzipped her top, making him uncomfortable, and followed him around 'like a puppy'. The doctor denied touching her inappropriately and said his office door had been open. He said she had been pointing to different parts of her body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive'. Manohar is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital (pictured). Nurse A said he groped her breast after she asked him about chest X-rays Nurse B alleged that Manohar touched her inappropriately on July 10 and October 31, 2013. She said the first time she went to A&E because she had pins and needles in her hands and feet. Nurse B said he examined and touched her genital area. However, she said she thought he had been professional and thanked him before he gave her a hug. She said on October 31 she saw him about a 'very bad headache' and he treated her in a dark room, checking her reflexes before touching her genital area. The A&E consultant claims he had been pointing to different parts of Nurse A's body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive' Nurse B again thought he had acted professionally and went to the hospital to drop off a thank you card. She said he invited her to meet him for coffee and she went to the hospital for 'a coffee type date' because she did not know he was married. Nurse B alleged Manohar invited her into his office, kissed her, told her how beautiful she was and suddenly without warning put his hand into her knickers. Mr McLachlan said: 'She stopped him straightaway. He told her that he was married with children.' Nurse B also reported him to the police. Manohar told officers he did not inappropriately touch her during either examination. He said she told him she had feelings for him but he said he was married and she started crying. Manohar admitted he then kissed her but said he did not think he had put his hand into her knickers. He said: 'I think she caught my hand and put it on top of her trousers or something.' Manohar, of Barnston, Wirral, denies four counts of sexual assault. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

    "document": "A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.",

    "document": "(CNN)Two Transportation Security Administration screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at Denver International Airport, Denver police said. Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim. The TSA said it has been trying to identify the passenger in the February incident but to no avail. The TSA said no passengers have come forward with similar cases so far at the Denver airport. Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing from luggage CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.",

    "document": "Six Minnesota men have been charged with terrorism in a criminal complaint unsealed Monday, the latest Westerners accused of traveling or attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group. The six, whom authorities described as friends who met secretly to plan their travels, are accused of conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The complaint says the men planned to reach Syria by flying to nearby countries from Minneapolis, San Diego or New York City, and lied to federal investigators when they were stopped. Scroll down for video Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, and Adnan Abdihamid Farah, both 19, and their four co-accused have been described as close friends who met secretly to plan their travel to Syria Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19, and the five other men arrested have been accused of being 'intent' on joining ISIS Charged are Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21; Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19; Abdurahman Yasin Daud, 21; Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20. 'These were focused men who were intent on joining a terrorist organization,' Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said at a news conference Monday. The six were arrested Sunday in Minneapolis and San Diego and are scheduled to make initial appearances in federal court on Monday. They are the latest people from Minnesota to be charged in an investigation stretching back months into the recruitment of Westerners by IS. Authorities said earlier that a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants in the past year, and at least one has died. Three of those charged in the newest complaint - Mohamed Farah, Abdurahman and Musse - were stopped at a New York City airport in November along with 19-year-old Hamza Ahmed, but they were not charged until now. Ahmed was indicted on charges of lying to the FBI during a terrorism investigation, conspiring to provide material support to IS, and attempting to provide material support. He has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the FBI announced the arrest of six Somali-American men from Minnesota, accused of trying to join ISIS. Above, FBI Special Agent Richard R Thornton details the arrests at a press conference, with U.S. Attorney Andrew M Luger to the left Despite being stopped already, Luger said, the three others continued to try to get to Syria to join IS 'by any means possible.' The complaint describes several interactions some of the men had with Abdi Nur, a Minnesota man charged previously with conspiracy to provide support to a terror organization. The complaint says Nur, 'from his locale in Syria, recruits individuals and provides assistance to those who want to leave Minnesota to fight abroad.' The complaint relies in part on material from a confidential informant who had himself conspired to join IS before he changed his mind and went to authorities. Some of the informant's conversations with the six men were recorded. The Minneapolis area is home to the largest concentration of Somali immigrants in the U.S. Since 2007, more than 22 young Somali men have also traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the militant group al-Shabab. Omar's older brother, Ahmed Ali Omar, was among those who joined al-Shabab, leaving Minnesota in December 2007, according to the complaint. Ahmed Omar remains a fugitive. It also said when agents went to the younger Omar's house after he was stopped in San Diego in November, another brother, Mohamed Ali Omar, threatened them.",

Police raided the house of John Koepke, in Wittmann, Arizona and found 54 dogs and 18 cats living in disgusting, cramped conditions.

Scroll down for video More than 70 animals have been seized from a filthy mobile home belonging to John Koepke who was banned from keeping pets One of the cats at the mobile home in Arizona was found nursing a set of three young Chihuahua puppies in a box Incredibly, one of the cats was found nursing a set of three young Chihuahua puppies. What happened to the Chihuahua's mother is not yet known. 'At least the cat was saving some animals,' said Sheriff Joe Arpaio in a press statement, 'I wont say the same thing for this guy.' Another cat in the video appeared to have a serious injury to its left eye while the body of a further feline was also discovered at the home. Many of the animals seized appeared to be suffering with medical problems and are currently being assessed by veterinary experts. The incredible feline has taken over the role of mother for the three puppies - it is not known what happened the dog's biological parent Footage of the raid showed revealed the disgusting environment the pets were forced to live in such as excrement left on the floor 'Their eyes are matted shut and they're weeping,' Officer Christopher Hegstrom, spokesman for Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, told NBC News, apparently referring to the animals. Koepke had been 'highly emotional' and refused to surrender his animals to the deputies on Wednesday, calling them 'his children.' The 71-year-old had already been made subject to a ban which prevented him from keeping any pets until May 2015 after an animal hoarding case in 2011. He will be charged with 72 counts of failure to provide shelter and could face thousands in medical bills once the cats and dogs have been fully assessed.

    "document": "A midwife has today accepted her mistakes 'contributed' to the deaths of two babies at a scandal-hit maternity unit. Marie Teresa Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against a raft of misconduct charges, choosing not to show up at her fitness to practise hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). She also declined to send a lawyer in her place. The panel has been told Ms Ratcliffe accepts 77 allegations relating to her care and treatment of 14 patients at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital in Cumbria between February 2004 and September 2013. Former midwife Marie Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against 77 misconduct charges at a fitness to practise hearing in front of the Nursing and Midwifery Council. She worked at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital where Joshua Titcombe, pictured, died at just nine days old They include the allegations that, in relation to two babies - one of whom died in February 2004 and another in September 2008 - Ms Ratcliffe's conduct 'contributed to the death' of, and/or caused the patient's baby 'to lose a significant chance of survival'. The allegations against Ms Ratcliffe also included claims she failed to adequately monitor patients, record key observations in patient notes or request assistance from doctors. Amanda Hamilton, representing the NMC, read out a letter written by Ms Ratcliffe which said that she will 'regret what happened for the rest of my life'. Ms Ratcliffe told the panel she is no longer a midwife, and has no intentions of returning to the profession. In the letter read to the NMC panel, sitting in Stratford, east London, Ms Ratcliffe said: 'I am a human being of good will and I accept that I have made mistakes and apologise to those affected by them.' In the letter, Ms Ratcliffe said she felt 'it was important not to delay' proceedings any further or efforts for people to look in to what happened by 'defending myself against these charges'. She denied being part of any cover-up or collusion of what had happened or effort to 'conceal the truth'. In March, an independent investigation into what happened at Furness General Hospital between 2004 and 2013, found failures led to the avoidable deaths of 11 babies and one mother Marie Ratcliffe is the first of eight midwives accused of misconduct and poor care at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Foundation Trust to appear before the NMC. In March, the independent inquiry into the failings at Morecambe Bay, led by Bill Kirkup, found failures at the trust led to the avoidable deaths of at least 11 babies and one mother. Feuding medics, an obsession with natural childbirth, and a tight knit group of midwives who dubbed themselves 'The Musketeers' contributed to a 'distressing chain of events' which led to avoidable harm to mothers and babies, at Furness General Hospital in Barrow, Cumbria. The independent investigation into serious incidents at the hospital between 2004 and 2013 uncovered a series of failures 'at every level' - from the maternity unit to those responsible for regulating and monitoring the trust which runs the unit. The report slammed the clinical competence of staff, a 'them and us' culture between midwives, obstetricians and paeditricians and an over-zealous pursuit of natural childbirth 'at all costs' by a small group of dominant midwives. It found 'shocking' substandard clinical competence, extremely poor working relationships between different staff groups and repeated failure to investigate adverse incidents properly and learn lessons. And the report suggests that when babies died, midwives conspired to cover up the failings. In total eight midwives who worked at the trust could face disciplinary action. The NMC said last year that four midwives should face hearings. Meanwhile another four midwives are still the subject of further investigations. She noted that the system had been flawed but that she was governed by those procedures. She stated that 'in writing these words I seek no leniency' adding 'I accept things I cannot change.' Panel chairman Gary Leong said: 'By her letter Ms Ratcliffe is aware of the proceedings. 'She has voluntarily absented herself. She is very clear that she does not wish to defend herself against these charges. 'In light of that the panel considers that an adjournment would not change the circumstances. She does not wish to come.' He said the hearing is a matter of public interest, and as such will continue today. The proceedings will hear from two of the women who were under the care of the former midwife when they lost their baby. The hearing was told about the first incident occurred in 2004 in relation to the mother referred to a Patient A. Ms Hamilton, for the NMC, said another midwife present at the birth said the baby 'was placed by the side of Patient A and appeared purple, blue and lifeless'. The baby was taken to a specialist unit in Liverpool Women's Hospital where it died on February 26, 2004. The second death of a baby occurred in September 2008. Other allegations she faces in regards to the Patient B's baby include a failure to record or observe maternal blood pressure and that she failed to adequately monitor and/or ensure the foetal heart rate was normal. The misconduct hearing, which is expected to last a month, will hear from several witnesses including the two patients who lost their children. The hearing heard that Ms Ratcliffe qualified as a midwife in 1990 and in 1997 she was promoted to a Band 7 Midwife at Furness General Hospital, part of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, where she worked until January 2014. The hearing continues.",

    "document": "Boston (CNN)Guilty across the board. But will he face death? After deliberating for 11½ hours, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial. Seventeen of the 30 counts were capital charges, meaning he is eligible for the death penalty. The trial will next move into a penalty phase, where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately be tasked with deciding whether Tsarnaev, 21, will be executed. A look at all of the charges Jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors such as the heinousness of his crimes against mitigating factors such as his family and mental health history, as well as his relative youth. Tsarnaev was 19 at the time of the bombing. The start date of the penalty phase has not yet been set. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. \"He was there,\" Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but many say the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Tsarnaev lawyer keeps hated criminals off death row Clarke tried to convince jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. After the verdict, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said Clarke now faces an uphill battle. \"Because No. 1, he (Tsarnaev) is almost functioning as an officer of a military organization attacking the United States -- the claim of course that he's an Islamic radical and that this is almost an army-like attack on civilians. \"And the second thing -- it was so well planned and so callously planned so that civilians would die, so that children would be maimed. And all of this, she has to get around and convince the jury he's not worthy of the death penalty. \"Boy, she's climbing the Mount Everest of death penalty cases in this case,\" Callan said about Clarke. Survivors react to the verdict Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. Dana Ford reported from Atlanta.",

    "document": "(CNN)A Delaware father is in stable condition and improving as his two boys remain in critical condition after they became sick -- perhaps from pesticide exposure, federal officials say -- during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. \"We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries,\" Enck said. \"You definitely want to wash them really good. \"This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant,\" Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. \"It's not something that you would have any warning of,\" Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. \"Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries,\" Maron said. The attorney added: \"The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable.\" CNN's Rob Frehse, Jean Casarez, Sara Ganim, Jason Hanna, Laura Ly and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.",

Remanded: Keith Anthony Allen, 27, of Columbus pleaded not guilty Monday to charges including rape, felonious assault and gross sexual imposition. He is accused of raping two 12-year-old girls  and fondling a third girl The assault charges allege he raped the girls while knowing he was HIV-positive and had consensual sex with a woman without telling her he has the virus that causes AIDS. Prosecutors say Allen could face a life sentence if he is convicted of having sex with a child under 13. The case marks the first time that the Franklin County prosecutor’s office has charged an adult with molesting children while knowing that he carries the virus that causes AIDS. 'I was outraged when I saw that police report,' Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O’Brien told The Columbus Dispatch. O’Brien said Allen had access to the two 12-year-old girls because his girlfriend is related to one of the children and the other sometimes spent the night with them. The assaults took place between September 1 and March 22, according to the indictment. Allen has been in the Franklin County jail since his arrest on March 25. His bail was set at $1 million. O'Brien says he is unaware of the health status of the victims in this case, whether or not any of them contracted HIV through Allen.",

    "document": "A young woman on Reddit has shared a set of inspiring before and after images, which showcase how an exercise plan she began 20 months ago in an effort to lessen her depression has not only helped her mentally – but has also ensured a dramatic physical transformation. Aliesha Peterson, 22, detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs – and enabled the Alberta, Canada, resident to gain a noticeably fitter, and much more muscular, physique, as well as an impressive six-pack. 'I can honestly say I am sooo thankful I started taking better care of myself [sic],' she wrote under her Reddit name ahhhgodzilla. 'My progress has been fairly slow but, to me, the most important thing is that I didn't give up.' Scroll down for video Impressive results: Aliesha Peterson, 22, first started exercising in August 2013, left; as of April 2015, right, she has lost nearly 20lbs and gained a six-pack Aliesha wasn't always a fan of working out - and explained that she didn't start hitting the gym to look better in a bikini, either. 'I was extremely depressed and refusing to go back on anti-depressants,' she explained. 'I went and saw a therapist, and she recommended that I join a gym and start working out three times a week. 'I reluctantly obliged and to be completely honest, I absolutely hated it. 'I hated how uncomfortable I felt there, that I obviously had no idea what I was doing.' But after three months of sticking with it, she admitted that she started to 'somewhat enjoy it'. Aliesha's routine is made up of exercises that focus on a different part of her body for each day of the week, and she will often do cardio on the weekends. Her workouts include several sets of squats, bench presses, crunches, curls, and planks. On Wednesdays, she works on her back, which she said is her favorite part of her body. Her back exercises include deadlifts, hyperextensions, and chin ups. Bringing sexy back: The 22-year-old says her back is her favorite part of her body, and she focuses on exercises to strengthen it every Wednesday 'Before' body: Aliesha, pictured here in 2013 before she started exercising, was by no means overweight, but she has since become more toned by sticking to a demanding workout schedule After about six months, Aliesha started changing her eating habits, too. While she once stuck to an unhealthy diet which included fast food 'at least twice a day', she began cooking her own meals and choosing to eat healthy food. Now, her diet consists of eggs, yogurt, fruit, chicken, seeds and nuts, green smoothies made with vegetables, protein shakes, turkey, and salmon. Aliesha admits that her story isn't one of shocking rapid weight loss - but she says her slow progress is the reason she's been so successful. 'I'm sure if I completely changed my lifestyle all at once that my results would have been a lot more impressive in a much shorter amount of time, but it would not have been sustainable,' she wrote. Because she's worked at a slow, steady pace, she's been able to maintain her new figure - which has been a boon to her self-esteem. 'I am much more confident in my body,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'I no longer hate looking in the mirror and have learned to accept my flaws and am able to see the positive qualities I possess as well.' Barely-there biceps: In October 2013, pictured, Aliesha had only just started going to the gym to help her improve her depression Welcome to the gun show: Pictured this month, Aliesha's arms have grown much more muscular; she says she now loves going to the gym Of course, Aliesha added, it isn't always easy to maintain the motivation to work out five to seven days a week, but sticking to a routine has helped. 'I truly believe the key to bettering yourself is to cultivate and preserve healthy habits,' she continued. 'The first few months are the hardest, but once you make it through that stage it becomes a lot less painful, and you may even learn to enjoy it like I have.' She is also enjoying what working out has done for her mental health. 'While I still struggle with depression, it is much, much less severe,' she said. 'Instead of laying in bed all day crying, letting it consume me, I get up and do things - go to the gym, do yoga, walk my dogs, see friends. 'The best part of getting into this routine has definitely been the mental change,' she concluded. 'My friends and family have all noticed the difference, my relationships are stronger, I feel better about myself, and I'm constantly striving for self improvement.'",

    "document": "A section  of Arsenal and Liverpool fans left their seats empty at the Emirates Stadium for the first 10 minutes of their lunchtime Barclays Premier League clash in a protest against ticket prices. Supporters from both clubs say they are 'disgusted' at the continuing rise of ticket prices, with the protest coming in the aftermath of the announcement of the Premier League's £5.14billion TV rights deal with banners held up inside and outside the ground. With tickets at the sold-out Emirates starting from £64 for the 12.45pm kick-off, protesters hope the image of empty seats around the ground will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs. Fans inside the Emirates Stadium display a banner reading: '£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket' The cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were £64, some of the highest prices in the Premier League Supporters of both sides gathered outside the 60,000-capacity stadium before kick-off to show off banners against the rising costs of modern football. A banner inside the stadium, held between the home and away ends, read: '£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket'. Ahead of the game, Kelvin Meadows of Arsenal's Black Scarf Movement - who organised the event with Liverpool's Spirit of Shankly and Spion Kop 1906 fan groups - called ticket prices 'extortionate'. 'In the pursuit of money football has sold it's soul,' he said. 'The fans are that soul and no one cares about the match going fans. Arsenal and Liverpool fans unite outside the Emirates Stadium in a protest against ticket prices Fans show off a banner reading 'FOOTBALL WITHOUT FANS IS NOTHING' outside the stadium before kick-off 'We put up with late fixture changes, unreasonable kick off times and ridiculously high prices. We do it 'cos of the love of our team. 'But the tide is turning. Old rivalries are being put aside as fans from all clubs come together. Away fans help make the event but have to pay extortionate prices. Then we're told to \"sit down, shut up\".' Roy Bentham of Spirit of Shankly said: 'We want tangible reductions in line with what working class people earn. We may lose a generation or more of fans otherwise unless the footballing authorities wake up.' Further protests are expected after full-time at the Emirates.",

    "document": "Washington (CNN)This week is the 100th anniversary of what many historians acknowledge as the Armenian genocide -- the Turkish massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians And it's also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the atrocity. It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a \"genocide\" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. \"The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence,\" he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. \"We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. \"No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on,\" she wrote.",

The Prime Minister said he will amend the Working Times regulations so for three days people can volunteer or serve as a school governor, and get paid in addition to their 28 days of paid holiday. But business leaders criticised the move as heavy-handed government intervention', amid doubts about how the policy would be paid for. Scroll down for video Happy handshake: The Prime Minister met staff and volunteers at the Age UK Day Centre in Plymouth today Prime Minister David Cameron's Big Society good deeds scheme will only affect firms with 250 or more staff The policy will apply to workers at firms with at least 250 staff - an estimated 10 million in the private sector and five million in the public sector. Volunteers would be able to take the time to volunteer in a block or flexibly. Announcing the policy Mr Cameron said: 'This election is about building a better future for our children and grandchildren. The foundation stone of that better future is our economic security. But Conservatives know the society we build on top of that is just as important too. 'This is the clearest demonstration of the Big Society in action - and I'm proud it's a Conservative government that will deliver it.'

'Many, many businesses are already highly engaged in their local community and with charitable causes, and the IoD thoroughly supports them. Passing a law to compel firms to pay their staff to volunteer for charity is hardly in keeping with the spirit of philanthropy. 'Businesses should support their staff if they want to volunteer, but the architects of this idea cannot pretend that forcing firms to give an additional three days of paid leave will do anything other than add costs. Time off for charity work and volunteering is a matter for managers and employees to discuss between themselves, not a target for heavy-handed government intervention. 'This announcement not only undermines the Tory record on reducing business regulation, it also puts additional pressure on public sector employers, and ultimately the taxpayer. Frankly, the essence of volunteering is that it is voluntary. The IoD would welcome proposals to incentivise and make it easier for companies to facilitate volunteering, but it has to be a choice.' Mr Cameron's plan will affect around 15 million workers across Great Britain in private and public sectors Survival expert and Television star Bear Grylls said that he supports Mr Cameron's volunteering scheme The plan was praised by the chairman of BT Mike Rake. He said: 'Corporate volunteering is a triple win - a win for the community, a win for individuals doing the volunteering, and a win for companies.' Survival expert and TV star Bear Grylls also lent Mr Cameron his support for the scheme. 'Any initiative that encourages people to volunteer is good news,' he said. 'All of us struggle to find extra time and that's why to have firm government support that enables millions to volunteer is a huge step forward towards building solid communities all around the UK.' However, just hours after Cameron's announcement, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said companies would not be forced to organise paid time-off for their employees, suggesting the policy would be unworkable. 'Nobody is forcing anybody to volunteer and no one is forcing companies to organise this volunteering if it causes problems to the company,' Mr Pickles told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added there would need to be 'a bit of give and take' with the Prime Minister's plan. The Communities Secretary insisted it would not add to costs in the NHS, with potential gaps having to be filled by extra agency workers. 'We're talking about three days and it would be worked out according to patterns of work and it will be worked out to ensure that it doesn't cause inconvenience to the health service,' he said. The former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said Mr Pickles had given a 'car crash' interview. He tweeted: 'If yesterday's Michael Fallon interview was a car crash, Eric Pickles just caused a motorway pile-up #r4today.' Mr Pickles suggested companies would not be forced to give staff days-off for volunteering under the plan Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott offered his view on Pickles' interview on the Today programme The Labour party raised concerns about the cost of the policy. Shadow minister Lisa Nandy said: 'This is a re-announcement from David Cameron that has unravelled before it's even been made. 'Giving every public servant three extra days off could cost millions of pounds but there's no sense of how it will be paid for. If just half of public sector workers took this up it would be the time equivalent of around 2,000 nurses, 800 police and almost 3,000 teachers.'",
    "claim": "pm announces plans to give millions of workers three days paid leave a year . scheme will only affect firms with 250 or more staff - an estimated 10 million in private sector and five million in public sector . but business leaders criticised the move as ` heavy-handed government intervention '",

    "document": "It's not just UV rays that suncreams now protect against - some new products claim to stop the damage from infra-red A rays, too. Meanwhile others say they protect the skin from the inside. But are any of these high-tech suncreams worth buying? Here, Dr Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, offers his verdict. And we rate them... A new generation of suncreams promise to protect against the damage from infra-red A rays and others say they protect the skin from the inside. Here, consultant dermatologist Bav Shergill gives his verdict Dr Skin's Suncare Lotion And Sun Drink £11.90 for five 60ml shots and 100ml lotion, dr-skins.com CLAIMS: SPF 30 suncream containing UVA and UVB protection, plus pack of five 60ml liquid food supplement shots - these contain vitamin E, lycopene, vitamin C, beta-carotene and other nutrients for skin health. EXPERT VERDICT: 'A bit of a gimmick - the concept is you are protecting the skin from the inside out with antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables. 'There's no evidence that drinking this would stop sun damage. 'The suncream is ok, but it's pretty standard.' 5/10 Ladival Sun Protection, SPF 30 £19.99 for 150ml spray, from Boots and supermarkets CLAIMS: First mainstream product to protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB. Also has antioxidants. Offers 'protection against four times more of the sun's rays'. EXPERT VERDICT: 'The effects of infra-red A rays on the skin is an emerging field of research. 'A recent study suggests antioxidants may stop damage from infra-red A. 'I'd plump for Factor 50 rather than Factor 30 - although some argue this only improves protection by 3 per cent. 'You can get the same UVA and UVB protection from cheaper products.' 6/10 Dr Skin's lotion and sun drink comes with liquid food supplement shots, while Ladival is the first product to protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB Goldfaden MD Sun Visor Oil Free Spray, SPF 30 £40 for 80ml, Space NK stores CLAIMS: This protects against UVA/UVB rays - it contains titanium oxide, oxtinoxate, benzophenone and organic red tea extract. Developed by a U.S. dermatologist, it is said to be the first over-the-counter sunscreen that is 'physician strength'. EXPERT VERDICT: 'Titanium oxide reflects UVA and UVB rays off the skin, while oxtinoxate absorbs UV rays and converts them to heat, so it doesn't damage DNA - most good suncreams should contain these. 'Physician strength' sounds impressive, but I'm not sure what it means. 'Organic red tea might help mop up the harmful molecules produced as a result of UV exposure. 'It's expensive and I'd opt for a Factor 50 product.' 6/10 Mustela is made from a avocado based ingredient, which 'aids development of the skin's barrier Mustela Very High Protection Sun Lotion SPF 50+ £14.95 for 100ml, from independent pharmacies CLAIMS: Avocado Perseose (a patented ingredient based on avocados, which have a high vitamin E content), aids development of the cutaneous (skin) barrier and preserves the wealth of cells in babies' skin. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This is easily absorbed and free of parabens (preservatives) and fragrance so would be good for a baby's sensitive skin as it won't cause irritation. 'Children are more likely to burn as their skin is still developing. 'Avocado oil is a good moisturiser, but it's not clear how it 'aids the development of the cutaneous barrier'. 'I'd say there are cheaper products that would work as well.' 7/10 Actinica Lotion £19.99 for 80g, larger branches of Superdrug and Lloyds Pharmacies and pharmacy2u.co.uk CLAIMS: For the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients (e.g. those who have a suppressed immune system, such as transplant patients). Protects against UVA and UVB. No SPF listed. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This product was tested for two years on immuno-suppressed patients who are at high risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, because they take drugs which suppress the body's defence cells which also destroy early cancer cells. 'Patients who've already had non-melanoma skin cancers might find it reassuring to use.' 8/10 Wilko Moisturising Sun Lotion SPF 50 £2 for 50ml, from Wilko stores CLAIMS: A UVA and UVB sunscreen. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This does what it says on the label. 'It has the same UVA and UVB protection ingredients as other more expensive creams, plus it is water resistant, and easily absorbed.' 9/10 Actinica aims to prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients while Calypso contains UVA and UVB protection, is water resistant and won't stain clothes Sun Ceutic 50 Anti-Ageing Sun Protection SPF 50 £31 for 50ml, from uniqueskin.com CLAIMS: This is said to prevent photo ageing (sun-induced skin damage) and sun spots and contains a 'powerful stem cell stimulator'; also contains hyaluronic acid, zinc oxide, titanium oxide and aloe vera. EXPERT VERDICT: 'All Factor 50 suncreams with UVA and UVB protection should protect against photo damage and sun spots. 'Hyaluronic acid is used as an anti-ageing treatment to restore lost volume in the skin, but there's limited evidence it has the same effect in a cream. 'It's not clear what the 'stem cell stimulator' is. 'This is the Holy Grail in skin care as it would reset the clock on skin cells, but I'm not aware that anybody has managed to do this yet.' 6/10 Calypso All School Day Long Once A Day Lotion SPF 40 £17.99 for 150ml, from Tesco, Sainsbury, and Aldi (£7 from Matalan) CLAIM: Contains UVA and UVB protection, it's water resistant and won't stain clothes. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This is OK for a school situation as children are mainly indoors. 'Suncream needs to be reapplied about every two hours if you are out in the sun because the creams get rubbed off - so this is not quite the once-a-day panacea you might anticipate.' 7/10",

    "document": "As attempts to break a world record go, it was pretty impressive. A Chinese team took a kite measuring an astonishing 6,000 metres (3.7 miles) to a kite flying festival - aiming to break the world record by a massive 1,000 metres. But they had overlooked the fact that their kite was so big, it posed a danger to passing aircraft. The kite, dubbed 'centipede with a dragon's head', was set to fly at the Wulong International Kite Festival last Saturday in Chongqing in south-western China, according to People's Daily Online. Scroll down for video Flying high: Half of the 6,000-metre-long dragon-themed kite took to the sky in Chongqing last Saturday Skilful: The kite weighs 200 kilograms and requires three experienced kite flyers to manoeuvre However, Chinese aviation authorities ruled that the dragon-themed kite - which is made from 2,000 separate pieces and weighs a whopping 200 kilograms - could not be flown, and the team were forced to fly only half of it. The weather at the kite flying festival in Chongqing undoubtedly played a part, with a heavy mist reducing visibility not only for pilots but for spectators who had turned up to witness the annual event. Each of the 2,000 pieces bears the Chinese characters 'China Dream' and it takes eight hours to get the full-length kite airborne. Wang Dongming, one of the three kite flyers, said special sturdier rope made from kevlar - which is also used to make bulletproof vests - had to be used to thread the  kite. Mr Wang said: 'Big kites and kites that are used for trick flying are usually built from this kevlar rope to prevent the line from snapping in the wind.' In order to secure the pieces on the kite, craftsmen only used bamboo that was more than three years old which can resist severe wind. Colourful: Kites of all shapes and shades take to the sky in Chongqing during the four-day-long festival Although the kite did not fly full-length, organisers of the festival still claimed that they had broken the Guinness World Record for the longest kite in the world. The previous record is reported to set by a 5,000m-long kite made by craftsmen in Weifang in eastern China last spring. Professional kite flying teams from over 13 countries participated in the four-day-long Wulong International Kite Festival, including representatives from China, New Zealand, the UK and Italy. Historical: A popular pastime in China, kite flying dates back some 2,000 years Global appeal: Professional kite flying teams from over 13 countries participated in the festival",

    "document": "An Air Force veteran and former Playboy model was arrested for taking an American flag from campus protesters who were trampling on it. Michelle Manhart, 38, was handcuffed by police at Valdosta State University, Georgia, and driven off in a patrol car after grabbing the Stars and Stripes and refusing to return it to the student demonstrators. Video footage of the event, on Friday, shows Manhart struggling with officers, who force her to the ground after she refuses to let the flag go. Scroll down for video Struggle: Manhart, 38, is shown, left, refusing to release a flag which protesters were trampling on. In the right-hand photograph she is seen being arrested at Valdosta State University in Georgia Cause: Manhart came to the campus because she heard students were walking on the flag, as seen above It shows her surrounded by protesters on the campus, who demand their property be returned. In response, Manhart says the flag belongs to 'the entire United States'. Campus police try to convince her to drop the flag, but Manhart, a former training sergeant who served in Kuwait, refuses. Speaking to the Valdosta Daily Times about her intervention, she said: 'I did not want anything like this, but I got a call from a student who told me that the flag was on the ground, and they were walking on it. 'I was just going over there to pick up the flag off the ground. I don’t know what their cause is, but I went to pick it up because it doesn’t deserve to be on the ground.' She continued: 'If your cause is racism then find some white people and walk on them. 'But to walk on the flag is walking on our symbol of freedom. You have the freedom to do what you are doing because of it. I’m not fighting against them. I’m fighting against the way they are going about it.' It is not clear what the demonstrators were rallying against. They did not answer reporters' questions about what their cause was. Air Force to bare force: Manhart was once a Staff Sergeant at the San Antonio Air Force training camp (right), but was demoted when she appeared nude in Playboy magazine. She is shown left holding a copy of the issue containing her spread According to the Daily Times, the group didn't want to press charges against Manhart. However, police gave her a trespass warning, which bans her from the campus. Manhart has come under fire for standing up for her beliefs before. In 2007 she made national headlines - and lost her job - for posing nude for Playboy magazine. Explicit photographs from the periodical's February 2007 issue show then-Sergeant Manhart in a variety of provocative poses - first with, then later without - her military uniform. Cover girl: After her original feature, Manhart appeared in Playboy again. She is shown here on the cover of the Mexican edition When Air Force bosses got wind of the racy feature, they relieved her of her duties at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. She was later demoted, and ultimately left the Air Force. However, she remained defiant, telling reporters at the time 'I didn't do anything wrong, so I didn't think it would be a major issue'. The decision brought an end to 14 years of service She later appeared in other editions of Playboy - including the cover of the Mexican edition -  and posed for animal rights group Peta to support an anti-fur campaign. The Daily Times reported that Manhart now intends to hold a pro-military counter-demonstration in the town on Wednesday. In response to the incident, the university's president says he disapproves of the flag-trampling protest, but recognizes their right to express themselves that way if they choose. Dr William McKinney said: 'The American flag represents everything that is best about our country. As the Supreme Court has held, one of those things is the right to free speech, which includes the right to disrespect even the symbol of our country. 'While I firmly disagree with the actions of the protesters, I understand their right to protest.'",

Videoed in their front room, the dog named Foxxy Cleopatra and the reptile called Ryuu can be seen chasing after one another around a coffee table. Standing perfectly still while looking in the other direction, the bearded dragon initially appears disinterested as the Chihuahua jumps around excitedly. The video begins with the Chihuahua jumping around excitedly while the bearded dragon appears disinterested The reptile then turns to face the dog, causing it to bark, run off and watch from a safe distance behind the table. Without warning, the bearded dragon then charges at full speed towards the dog and forces it to make a quick retreat. Pausing at the end of the table, the reptile waits as the sneaky dog creeps up behind it before pivoting and running after it again. The Chihuahua named Foxxy Cleopatra stalks the bearded dragon on a number of ocassions in the video The video maker said that the Chihuahua never tries to hurt the dragon and loves to chase after him The video maker, named Meo Madeley, can then be heard laughing as the bearded dragon becomes even more animated and chases the dog in a circle. Later in the clip the dog creeps up behind the reptile but remains twitchy and nervous as it prepares to run away at any minute. According to the video maker, who is believed to live in Canada, the pair completely love one another. The filmmaker can then be heard laughing as the bearded dragon  chases the dog around the coffee table She wrote in the comment section of the original video: ‘They seriously love to play together. I love to watch them. ‘Our Chihuahua never tries to hurt the dragon, she really loves to chase him and our dragon gets excited whenever she comes into the room because he thinks it's time to play. They make us laugh all the time.’ Interestingly however, Ms Madeley also stated that the love is entirely loyal as their other pet hardly gets a look in. ‘Our beardie doesn't like our cat, so we don't let them play together.

    "document": "A 78-year-old Connecticut man with a long criminal history was arrested on Friday, but the man's lawyer claimed the arrest was a ruse intended to pressure him to talk about the biggest art heist in U.S. history. Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black. Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an Édouard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar FBI investigators have long said they believed organized crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum",

A flare, hurled from the stands, hit the Russian keeper on the head in the opening seconds of the game Igor Akinfeev is carried off the pitch on a stretcher, which led to an 30 minute delay before play resumed The keeper was carried off the field to hospital for tests before eventually making a full recovery 'In addition, the FSCG has been ordered to play its next two UEFA competition matches as host association behind closed doors. The second match to be played behind closed doors is deferred for a probationary period of two years. Finally, the association has been fined 50,000 euros.' Russia did not escape unpunished for their players' actions and were issued with a 25,000 euro (£18,143) fine. The head of the Football Association of Montenegro (FSCG) had branded fans who forced the abandonment as 'barbarians'. Montenegro fans light flares from the stands during the Euro 2016 qualifier on March 27 Russian fans voice their displeasure after the game is eventually called off In a statement published on the FSGC's website the day after the game, the association's secretary general Momir Durdevac said: 'The match from the first minute was on the verge of interruption. 'You saw how many people were involved in the organisation, how many times we asked the crowd to refrain from everything. 'But it seems that we do not deserve, neither the country nor the national team, a place in the big competition. Riot police clash with Montenegrin fans after the game is abandoned following a pitch brawl 'They are here to disrupt, they are here to be barbarians. When we play against the great teams and great players, they are here to denounce these players, not to enjoy their skills. 'To interrupt the match, to throw something on the pitch, and then chant: 'Montenegro, I love you' - it is such hypocrisy, it's such primitivism that should not be seen anywhere. 'For me, the game should not have continued after the first minute.'",

    "document": "Richie Benaud has passed away  at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer but the man who spoke with an unrivalled blend of insight, authority and wit from commentary boxes at cricket matches across the globe will always be remembered. Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career. Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer 1. BALL OF THE CENTURY Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting. 2. AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable. 'One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field,' he raged from the Channel Nine studio. 3. LAST SPELL OF COMMENTARY IN ENGLAND Benaud's final commentary duties for Channel 4 came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2005 and was commemorated by members of the crowd waving banners in tribute. 4. 'YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL THERE!' Benaud's  cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour, an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit. 5. ANDREW SYMONDS STOPS A STREAKER Thankfully, Benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between Australia and India. 6. TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP HUGHES Benaud narrated Channel Nine's powerful tribute to Phillip Hughes in November 2014. 7. GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P.S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership. He was the first man to score over 2,000 runs and take more than 200 wickets in Tests and one of his finest dismissals came against England in 1958.",

    "document": "There are few things more beautiful - or terrifying - than the menacing flash of lightning bolts within a volcanic ash cloud. The latests picture, captured by an amateur photographer as the Colima volcano in Mexico spews out a plume of ash and lava, reveals the raw power of a volcanic eruption. Hernando Rivera Cervantes took the pictures as local authorities warned those living around the volcano, which is also known as the Fire volcano, to prepare for a possible evacuation. Lightning strikes inside the enormous ash cloud thrown into the air by the Colima volcano (above) in Mexico The 12,400 feet (3,800 metre) high volcano, which first erupted in 1576, is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico. Mr Cervantes spent eight hours watching the volcano as it threw ash up to 1.8 miles (three kilometres) into the atmosphere before managing to capture the rare picture. He said: 'I waited for eight hours, knowing something was going to happen. When the lightning arrived it was magical. An unforgettable experience.' These blots of lightning are thought to occur due to the build up of electric charge in the ash cloud as the particles rub against each other. Just like in a thunder cloud, this charge eventually builds up until it seeks a path through to the ground as lightning. This sequence of images captured by photographer Hernando Rivera Cervantes show the lightning flashes as the Colima volcano erupted Mr Cervantes also managed to capture this night-time image above of lava spilling from the erupting volcano Small volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years have been protecting the Earth from global warming, according to a recent study. Scientists have confirmed that droplets of sulphur-rich aerosols spewed into the upper atmosphere by volcanoes have been reflecting sunlight away from the Earth. Until recently it was thought that only particularly large eruptions had any noticeable affect on the climate. However, a study published earlier this year has confirmed results from the end of last year that showed these small eruptions can have an accumulative impact on global temperature. This could have helped decrease the global temperatures by between 0.05°C to 0.12°C over the past 15 years. Earlier this month scientists discovered that it is this lightning that is responsible for making the glass spheres that can appear in volcanic rocks. They found that the intense heat generated by the lightning bolts causes the ash to melt into spherules of smooth glass. A bolt of volcanic lighting can heat the surrounding air to more than 3,000°C, according to the researchers from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Dr Kimberly Genareau, a volcanologist at the University of Alabama, said their findings suggested that the role lightning plays in volcanic eruptions may be under reported. Writing in the journal Geology, she said: 'We refer to this new morphological classification of ash grains as lightning-induced volcanic spherules (LIVS). 'Observation of LIVS in tephras (volcanic rocks) will provide evidence of lightning occurrence during eruptions where lightning was not directly observed or documented.' The Colima volcano is actually one of three volcanic domes that make up the Colima Volcanic complex in the Mexican state of Colima, 301 miles west of Mexico City. It has erupted around 40 times since its first recorded activity in 1576. There are now around 300,000 people living in it shadow. The volcano has a history of large and explosive eruptions, which has meant it is also one of the most studied volcanoes in Mexico. Although lightning in volcanic ash clouds has been observed for a long time, scientists have only recently begun to understand what causes it. The Colima volcano is regarded as one of the most dangerous in Mexico due to its large explosive eruptions Mr Cervantes (shown above) spent eight hours waiting to capture his stunning images of the Colima volcano Getting close enough to an erupting volcano is dangerous, so scientists at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich recreated volcanic lightning in a lab. In 2013 they suspended volcanic ash gathered from sites around the world in a chamber filled with argon gas, forcing the concoction through a narrow tube. They found that the movement of ash particles against each other as they go from the compressed environment under the Earth's surface into the atmosphere during an eruption causes a built of up static charge. When the ash reaches the atmosphere, the energy is discharged as lightning bolts.",

Pictured is Gina Michelle, the clerk abused by McHenry and told she needed to lose some weight The incident occurred on April 6. The parking attendant can be heard in the video warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. 'That’s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this,' McHenry responds. 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' The parking attendant patiently replies: 'Well lets get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money…with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' She's outta there: ESPN immediately responded by suspending McHenry, but only for one week After a few more comments, including telling the woman she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting.

    "document": "(CNN)Kayahan, one of Turkey's best-loved singers and songwriters, died of cancer Friday at the age of 66. He had performed most recently in Istanbul on Valentine's Day. The performer, who was also an accomplished guitarist, was first diagnosed with cancer in 1990, the year he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the year before he released the album that ignited his career. The cancer returned in 2005 and then again in 2014, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. He died Friday in a hospital in Istanbul, five days after his 66th birthday. \"We are in grief over losing Kayahan, who contributed to Turkish music with countless compositions and marked a generation with his songs,\" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu tweeted. The singer, whose full name was Kayahan Acar, was born in Izmir province, in western Turkey on March 29, 1949. He grew up in Ankara, Turkey's capital, before moving to Istanbul. In 1990, he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, finishing 17th. The following year he released an album titled \"I Made a Vow,\" which catapulted him to prominence. Though he recorded nearly 20 albums, that one would remain his most popular. His final album was released in 2007. Other artists recorded his material throughout his career. Videos available online show a vibrant performer with a thick shock of dark hair as he accompanies himself on guitar and croons in a clear tenor. Kayahan was best known for his love songs. More recent videos show a  frailer performer, seated and without a guitar, but still clearly glorying in the joy of singing a song.",

    "document": "The family of a charity worker who drowned while volunteering to help youngsters in one of South Africa's poorest townships have paid tribute to their 'bubbly tomboy'. Summer Robertson from Shrewsbury died after being overpowered by fierce currents off a picturesque beach in December near Kenton-on-Sea, a small town on the country's south-eastern coast. Miss Robertson was with three other British members of a team that had completed a 10-week charity adventure together with the Latitude youth volunteering group, at a remote camping resort. Summer Robertson, 21, who died after drowning off the coast of South Africa, where she had been helping youngsters in one of the country's poorest townships Miss Robertson's parents Sarah and John have been remembering their daughter who they described as a 'bubbly tomboy' But she soon got into difficulties in the water and died before she was brought to shore. Another volunteer, 19-year-old Alice Barnett, from Canterbury in Kent also passed away after her body was washed up on the beach a day later. Now four months after the incident, her parents John and Sarah, who also have two sons Michael and Sam, have been remembering their daughter, who died while on a trip of a lifetime working with deprived youngsters. Her father Mr Robertson, a 51-year-old works foreman, said he spoke to his daughter on the day she died. He explained: 'I spoke to her that Thursday morning. Summer pictured volunteering in South Africa. The 21-year-old had spoken to her father John just hours before she had died Miss Robertson, left, died alongside fellow volunteer Alice Barnett, right, after they went for a celebratory swim after finishing their volunteering course 'She said everything was great, they had finished their work and were having a few days relaxing before they came home. 'I was due to pick her up on the Tuesday. She contacted us at least once a week and said she was living the dream.' Her mother says she had no worries about her daughter taking part in the trip, but Mr Robertson added he did warn her to stay out of the sea, as she was not a confident swimmer. He added: 'She was only paddling in shallow waters. It's just horribly sad. 'On the night of her death, two policemen came to the door at 11.30, and I knew straight away. 'I knew it was either Summer or our son Sam, who was living in digs in Birmingham at the time while at university. 'As soon as they said Summer's name, I knew something had happened.' Miss Robertson's death came soon after she landed her dream job as an apprentice in the parts department at Hatfield Jaguar in her hometown.

Her family have now launched an appeal to raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind as a tribute to her And while they are heartbroken over their daughter's death, her parents say they take great comfort from the fact that she died doing something she loved. Her mother said: 'It has motivated us to want to do something positive in her memory. 'We've decided to take a leaf out of Summer's book, and not take life so seriously. 'Now I don't mind so much if the phone doesn't work. There's more to life than worrying about work and paying the mortgage. 'That's only stuff, as Summer would say.' The family have now launched an appeal to raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind as a tribute to Miss Robertson. It came after £1,500 was donated to the appeal through a collection at her funeral. It is hoped they can raise £10,000, which would allow them to name a guide dog puppy after Miss Robertson.

    "document": "A former Utah high school teacher accused of having sex with three of her male students took a plea deal Wednesday to avoid a trial, sobbing as she accepted the agreement in court. One of the boys was 16 and two were 17 when they were having sex with Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35. One testified that he considered her to be his girlfriend during their yearlong tryst. But the boys were all minors, and Utah law also says a person cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust. Altice could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month. Scroll down for video Guilty: Former Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35, pictured here in court on Wednesday, pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse involving three male students Lengthy prison sentence: Altice accepted the agreement in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. She could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month Altice pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. School officials knew about Altice's inappropriate behavior and didn't do enough to protect the students, the boys and their parents say. In one of two lawsuits filed against the Davis School District, the plaintiffs said the running joke at the high school was, ‘Who is Ms. Altice sleeping with now?’ Davis School District spokesman Chris Williams said he would love to comment on the allegations but that the civil lawsuit precludes him from saying anything. Prosecutor Susan Hunt said the three victims are on board with the plea deal, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Altice is scheduled to be sentenced May 28. Each count carries a possible sentence of 1 to 15 years in prison. Altice's attorney, Ed Brass, said his client wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial. Brass previously defended Altice, saying she was no longer the boys' teacher when the sex occurred. Altice's attorney said his client, pictured in court back in January, wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial Altice was first arrested in October 2013 after a student reported having a relationship with her. Two more victims later came forward with similar allegations. She was out on bail during most of the criminal proceedings until allegations emerged earlier this year that she had sex with the third victim following her 2013 arrest. A judge ordered her to jail, where she's been for the three months. Brass asked the judge Wednesday to let Altice out on bail until her sentencing, but the judge denied the request. Brianne Altice was hired by the Davis County School District in 2004 and had been teaching at the high school since August 2012. She was put on leave from the school after the allegations came to light and later fired in February 2014. She had been ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor, in connection to her suspected affairs with three students. In mid-March, one of the alleged victims brought a $647,000 lawsuit against the Davis County School District accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the 'flirtatious' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him. More legal trouble: Two students have filed lawsuits against the Davis County School District in Utah accusing officials of failing to fire English teacher Brianne Altice, pictured in court in January, who is accused of having sex with three boys Earlier this month, another student sued the district for hiring Altice, reported The Salt Lake Tribune. Court documents detailed how at times, the students skipped other classes and spent entire days with Altice, sent her text messages and made explicit comments to her. On her part, the 35-year-old Altice confided in her teenage admirers about her martial problems. According to the complaint, the relationship between the woman and the boys in her class eventually turned physical. Similarly to the first lawsuit, the new complaint alleged that the school district was aware of Brianne Altice's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on  bail for charges relating to the first two students. The student who brought the initial lawsuit in March accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He stated that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal.",

    "document": "When Emma Jackson, 28, moved into a quiet cul-de-sac in Hull just over a year ago, she thought she had found the perfect place to call home. But within a week of moving in, her dream home turned into a nightmare thanks to an aggressive neighbour with a penchant for watching TV with the volume turned up at all hours of the day. Unable to sleep because of the racket, the photography student asked unemployed Mark Ray, 56, to turn it down - but was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated, a year later, in violent threats and stalking. Terrified: Emma Jackson, 28, was subjected to vile verbal abuse and was stalked by her neighbour Now Ms Jackson has been forced to move home because of Mr Ray but says she lives in terror of him discovering her new address. Ms Jackson's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground floor flat, which she did despite having been warned that the previous occupants also had trouble with Mr Ray. 'I was told that the previous tenants antagonised him but I'm obviously not like that so I didn't think it would be a problem,' she said. Then the daily barrage of noise began. 'On the first morning, I was laid in bed and it was about 6am and all of a sudden, there was this noise. 'The TV was on at full blast to the point that you could hear what he was watching. The ceilings are really low so it was right above my bed.' After a week, Ms Jackson approached her neighbour to ask whether he would mind turning the sound down a bit but found herself on the receiving end of an expletive-laden tirade. Aggressive: Mark Ray, 56, waged a year-long campaign of terror against Ms Jackson Quiet: Ms Jackson and Mr Ray were neighbours in this quiet cul-de-sac in Hull 'I got this explosion, this tirade of abuse,' she remembers. 'Then he ran off and went into his flat and I was just totally shocked. It was the first time I'd met him and that's what I got from him.' The noise continued, with Ms Jackson forced to resort to headphones in order to get any sleep at all. Worse still, Mr Ray began to subject her to vile tirades every time he spotted her in the street or over the garden fence. Incensed, Ms Jackson got in touch with the local Housing Association. Although ordered to turn his television down, the 28-year-old says Mr Ray's new leaf lasted for just seven days. 'He kept to that for about a week and then he just crept back up again and it went back to how it was before.' Finally at breaking point, Ms Jackson snapped and banged on the ceiling with a broom handle during a cleaning session. Mr Ray responded by banging on her front door and, when confronted and accused of bullying by Ms Jackson, threw a 3ft wooden pole at her. Damage: As well as threatening violence, Mr Ray nailed the shed door shut (see photo held by Ms Jackson) Traumatised: Ms Jackson says her year of living next door to Mr Ray was the worst of her life As the situation at home worsened, it began to affect all areas of Ms Jackson's life, with Mr Ray even turning up at her workplace. Her family were also affected, with Mr Ray physically threatening her step-mother and father when they visited Ms Jackson's home. 'Mr Ray came out, he was shouting and swearing as usual and red in the face,' she remembers. 'He had a massive rock on top of his bin. 'My step-mum was standing close to the fence and he held it over his head as high as it could go and said \"I'm going to kill you\". 'My dad ran forward and put his hand out to stop it. I was just totally shocked and I feared for my step-mum's life. If he'd have dropped it on her, he would definitely have killed her.' The police were called and Mr Ray was handed an injunction that prevented him from approaching or speaking to Ms Jackson. But even that wasn't enough to stop him. 'I think he was scared for a bit and didn't want to get into any trouble,' she says. 'But then his actual personality must have got the better of him because he started again a few weeks later. 'Instead of overtly harassing me, he would follow me down the street. You could hear it was him because of his stick. 'Everywhere I went, he turned up, he was there. It made me feel really paranoid because every time I walked down the street, I could feel his eyes on the back of my head.' By now at her wits end, Ms Jackson says every part of her life was suffering. 'It was affecting everything in my life,' she says. 'It was affecting my studies because I couldn't sleep. It was affecting my work because I had everything going on at once and it was just ridiculous. 'My hair started falling out because I was just that stressed about it all.' Eventually, Ms Jackson installed a CCTV camera and was finally able to gather the evidence she needed to prove Mr Ray was breaking the terms of the injunction. In October 2014, he was issued with a new injunction that said he would face immediate arrest should he become violent or threaten it. But for Ms Jackson, it was too little, too late and she has now moved into a new home away from Mr Ray. 'It's been the worst year of my life,' she says. 'I've been depressed. It's affected my relationships with people. 'I don't want him to find out where I live [now] because I'm sure he would do something. He is that type of person and that does scare me.'",

    "document": "Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United at Elland Road after the Welsh club backed their fans in handing back their allocation of 500 tickets. Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.' Cardiff City Supporters Club Chairman Clive Francis said, 'Cardiff City Supporters Club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the Football Club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups. 'The \"bad old days\" of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of \"fans\" have thankfully been left far behind us now. This is now reflected in the respectful treatment received from the majority of clubs we visit. Let’s hope that this message hits home loud and clear to Leeds United Football Club.'",

    "document": "(CNN)An unmanned Russian spacecraft originally bound for the International Space Station will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere after flight controllers lost contact with it, American astronaut Scott Kelly said Wednesday. The spacecraft  that lost contact with flight controllers will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in about a week, Roscosmos, the Russian Federal Space Agency, said Wednesday. \"Roscosmos (the Russian Federal Space Agency) announced that the Progress will not be docking and will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere,\" Kelly said from the space station. The Progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between May 5 and May 7, according to Roscosmos. The Progress vehicle does not present any danger to the International Space Station due to a significant difference in orbit, Roscosmos added. The Russia space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the ISS and expects to launch a new Progress ship in the third quarter of this year. Russia lost contact with ISS Progress 59 during a resupply mission to the International Space Station. The ship is now spinning out of control, NASA said. Even if Russia hadn't lost contact with the craft, the original plan was for Progress to burn up re-entering Earth's atmosphere -- albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station. According to NASA information on the Progress resupply vehicle, \"After the cargo is removed and before the Progress undocks, the crew refills it with trash, unneeded equipment and wastewater, which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.\" The cargo spacecraft launched successfully early Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. But after it separated from the Soyuz booster rocket's third stage, Russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft's systems, including the deployment of navigational antennae, NASA said. \"The spacecraft made another pass over Russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system,\" the American space agency said in an update. A planned rendezvous with the ISS six hours later was initially postponed to Thursday but has now been canceled, NASA said in its latest update. \"Docking has been called off for the Progress 59 spacecraft,\" it said. \"Russian flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be. Additional information will be provided as it becomes available.\" Few details have been forthcoming so far from Roscosmos. According to NASA, the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food, fuel, oxygen, spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station. But the hitch will not put the six ISS crew members at risk, NASA said. \"The spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the United States Operating Segment (USOS) of the station,\" a statement said. \"Both the Russian and USOS segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight.\" That next flight, which will be the seventh SpaceX commercial resupply services mission to the space station, is not scheduled  to take off before June 19, NASA said. Meanwhile, Russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with Progress 59 as it passes over Russian ground stations. NASA said Tuesday that Russian flight controllers had \"confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it.\" According to Russian state news agency Tass, six attempts to make contact were to be made Wednesday. The U.S. supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station's environmental control and life support system, backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing, \"all of which are replaceable,\" NASA said. U.S. astronaut Terry Virts, from Maryland, is the current space station commander. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Suzanne Presto and Amanda Barnett contributed to this report.",

    "document": "Chris Christie's wife has quit her big-money job on Wall Street in what could be a sign her husband has decided to run for president in 2016. May Pat Christie, 51, a managing director at New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co, ditched her $475,000-a-year position this week, a family spokesman confirmed. The official reason for the resignation was 'to spend more time with her family and young children'. But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return. He later tried to clarify his comments by saying 'we have four children to raise and a lot of things to do' - but many pointed out that he still easily sits in the wealthiest 1 per cent of his home state.",

    "document": "Three men accused of being agents of the Syrian government have been executed in a shocking new video, Islamic State has claimed. The barbaric footage, released earlier today, shows the men kneeling in the middle of a dusty road in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, as a militant brandishing a sharpened sword stands behind them. It comes just one day after the extremist group claim to have shot and beheaded more than 30 Ethiopian Christians in Libya. Each of the men are forced on to their hands and knees in the war-torn street before they are beheaded The harrowing video shows the sword used to kill the men being forged and sharpened for the executions The three men were accused of being Assad agents, working for the Syrian governmment, say ISIS The new eight-minute video shows the men - wearing orange Guantanamo-style jumpsuits with their hands and feet in chains - sitting in a dirty, underground room. After giving information about each of the prisoners in Arabic, the men are blindfolded and filmed in the back of a moving van while an ISIS militant decked in black guards over them. When the van stops, the barefoot captives are escorted out and begin to march slowly down an abandoned street, surrounded by fighters holding guns. The professionally-shot film pans the scene - showing buildings irreparably damaged by bombing - before phasing into a picture of the executioner's sword being sharpened before the brutal executions. One by one the prisoners are beheaded by a fighter, who is dressed completely in black and unidentifiable. Their bodies are left on the road. Initial reports suggested the extremist group targeted the men because they worked for the Syrian regime. But they did not confirm who the men - thought to be aged between 35 and 45 - were or when the execution took place. The prisoners were filmed barefoot and in shackles in an unknown prison at the start of the sick video They were then blindfolded and transported in a van to the execution point - thought to be Deir ez-Zo in Syria Sparks fly from the sword as it is sharpened, before being used to behead the men in a brutal execution One by one the men are murdered. The body of one of the men can been seen after he was beheaded It is the latest footage released by the militant group, which is increasingly using propaganda to encourage would-be jihadi fighters. Yesterday a 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive in Libya. It showed at least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', being shot in a desert area while 12 others were beheaded on a beach. In February a similar video was released showing the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya. The helpless men were kept under a close watch by their ISIS captives. Videos of this nature - often professionally shot - are used by the militant group as propaganda to attract other would-be jihadi fighters The bodies of each of the helpless men, thought to be aged between 35 and 45, were then left on the road One of the victims, flanked by two fighters in black, can be seen being led down the abandoned Syrian road ISIS has taken over large sections of iraq and ISIS and carried out multiple public executions similar to this The battle against Islamic State amid a protracted civil war in Syria is thought to have already claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people. ISIS has destroyed churches and Christian shrines in the country. They also demanded that Christians living under its rule pay a 'special tax' known as jizya. Fighters from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) have been on the offensive and a large area is now divided between Kurdish and IS control. The extremist group has been able to gain a foothold amid chaos in Libya and is also advancing in Iraq.",

    "document": "The pursuit of journalists for paying public officials was in ruins last night after prosecutors dropped a raft of cases. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the £20million ‘politically-motivated witch hunt’ turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists – Operation Elveden – was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said ‘enough is enough’, adding: ‘It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.’ The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain’s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers’ cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office – under which prosecutions were brought – had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists – news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt – still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials – including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff – charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday’s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was ‘remarkable’ that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: ‘Enough is enough.’ The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured ‘two years of torture’. He added: ‘I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It’s a disgraceful waste of public money.’ The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest. Mrs Saunders said the original police inquiry was ‘inevitable’ and left prosecutors with a ‘duty’ to act. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

On the table the five-time world champion enjoyed a successful day, firing two rapid centuries in establishing a 12-4 lead, needing just one more in Monday's closing session to the match to reach the quarter-finals. But O'Sullivan was also spoken to by the referee Olivier Marteel towards the end of the afternoon session - and warned about his behaviour. Ronnie O'Sullivan is spoken to by referee Olivier Marteel in his second round match against Matthew Stevens O'Sullivan is spoken to by referee Marteel in his second round match against Stevens at the Crucible Marteel approached O'Sullivan as he walked to the table when Stevens missed a red, telling O'Sullivan he had noticed his hand gesture, which was thought to have been self-directed. O'Sullivan avoided a fine in the first round when he briefly played without shoes after a new pair proved uncomfortable, breaking the rules but not sufficiently to warrant any punishment, after he accepted a substitute pair of size eights, loaned by tournament director Mike Ganley. Stevens reacts to a shot in his match against O'Sullivan during day nine of World Championships Stevens in action against O'Sullivan in their second round match  at the Crucible Theatre The warning from Marteel could be the end of Sunday's matter. Yet any repeat of the incident would see O'Sullivan docked a frame, a tournament spokesman confirmed. Armed with a 5-3 lead from the opening session, O'Sullivan took the opening two frames on Sunday to pull further in front. The next went against the 39-year-old, but breaks of 110 and 139 in consecutive frames suggested O'Sullivan was in unstoppable form, as sweeping through the subsequent three testified.

    "document": "This is the moment a paedophile was caught by police after grooming a girl he believed to be 14 on the internet. Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli, who is of Afghani origin, was snared by a paedophile vigilante group called Letzgo Hunting. Married Adeli, 32, arranged to meet someone he believed to be a young teenage girl after engaging in sexual conversations online and sending an indecent image of himself. Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli who was arrested at a bus station in Leicester after thinking he was going to meet a 14-year-old girl for sex Adeli had been duped by paedophile vigilante group Letzgo Hunting and police were waiting to arrest him when he turned up at the bus station The vigilante group filmed the meeting, which showed Adeli putting his head in his hands when he realised he had been tricked Adeli agreed to pay for 'Amy's' bus fare to make the 13-mile journey from Hinckley, Leicestershire, to Leicester, where they had arranged to meet. When he arrived, he had three condoms in his pocket. But instead of being greeted by a schoolgirl, Adeli was confronted by police who arrested him immediately while the vigilante group filmed his reaction. The video of his arrest on December 10 has been posted on Facebook and viewed more than 10,000 times. In the footage, Adeli is asked to show his identification to police as he looks up at the officer in disbelief. He pauses before telling officers his name. The officer says: 'I am arresting you on arranging and facilitating child sex offences.' Adeli bows his head and puts his hands over his face before he is led away by police. On Wednesday Adeli was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court after he admitted attempting to meet a girl under 16 after grooming her online. 'Amy' was in fact a vigilante named John who was pretending to be a young girl. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, told the court: 'The man, John, acts as a self-appointed paedophile hunter carrying out covert internet investigations, trying to identify and expose those who would prey on children using the internet. 'He and colleagues used to film such confrontations and put them on the internet, but now they've changed their way of handling matters and contact the police when there's been a meeting arranged.' Mr Murphy said the vigilante had set up a bogus online profile in December claiming to belong to a girl called Amy from Hinckley. Within days, Adeli had made contact and the pair started talking online and exchanged texts and images on their mobiles. The court was told that Adeli had thought he had been chatting to a schoolgirl named Amy, when in fact he had been talking to a member of Letzgo Hunting called John Yesterday he was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court after admitting attempting to meet a girl under 16 for grooming Although Amy's profile said she was 18, Mr Murphy said that during the conversations the man who was posing as Amy made it clear that she was in fact 14. Adeli claimed to be 28. During the online chats, 'Amy' said: 'Sorry, you're too old for me.' The prosecutor said Adeli replied: 'I know, but we can be friends and talk.' Mr Murphy added: 'The conversation became sexual, with the defendant leading the way. He asked if she would perform sex acts upon him, suggesting it in the most explicit terms. They made arrangements to meet after two days.' Navinder Sekhon, defending, described the meeting as a 'preparatory offence and not a completed one' and said that Adeli felt 'deep-seated remorse'. Mr Sekhon told the court that Adeli cared for his sick wife and 'wishes to be reunited with her'. Adeli, who has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK, was placed on a ten-year sexual offences prevention order. Judge Philip Head, sentencing said: 'It was your intention to have full sexual activity with someone you believed to be 14 and something you know to be a crime in this country. 'You were grooming this person for sexual activity.' The Letzgo Hunting group has caught dozens of paedophiles by posing as young girls online, arranging meetings and then alerting the police. In court Mr Murphy said it had been 'made clear' that the police didn't support the group's actions but once they had been given information about an offence they had to investigate it. Adeli has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK and was also placed on a 10 year sexual offences prevention order",

    "document": "Scottish voters would rather have a referendum on the EU than another independence vote, a new survey has revealed. The idea of having another referendum on Scotland's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters. It comes after Scottish First Minister  Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections. Scroll down for video Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was campaigning in Aberdeen today ahead of a second TV debate tonight When questioned on the issue in last night's Scottish leaders TV debate, Ms Sturgeon insisted an SNP victory in the General Election would not trigger another referendum. But she added it was 'another matter' whether a vote for her party in the 2016 Holyrood elections would bring about a second vote on independence. Ms Sturgeon has also vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. But a poll by Ipsos Mori for BBC Scotland reveals that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was more popular with voters north of the border than another independence ballot. More than 1,000 adults were questioned for the research, with pollsters asking them to give various issues a score of between one and 10, depending on how important these were to them. A score of one meant a policy should not be implemented while 10 was taken to mean it should be put into action immediately. In last night's TV showdown with the Scottish leaders of Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems, Mr Sturgeon refused to rule out a second independence vote before 2020 Ms Sturgeon has  vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe The most popular policy was increasing the minimum wage for those aged over 21, which was given a score of 8.2. Giving the Scottish Parliament power over all welfare benefits was eighth most popular, with a score of 7.1, while transferring full responsibility for income tax to Holyrood came 10th on the list at 6.8. Holding another independence referendum by 2020 was given a score of 5.6, compared to 6.1 for a referendum on remaining in the EU. Scottish National Party election campaign director Angus Robertson insisted the poll showed support for his party's main policies. He said: 'This is a very welcome poll - it demonstrates that the people of Scotland share our view that the Westminster parties are not delivering on their referendum vow, and want far more power for Scotland. 'Electing a strong team of SNP MPs in May is the only way to ensure that Scotland gets the power we need to build social justice and economic prosperity.' Scotland's political leaders, from left to right, Tory Ruth Davidson, Labour's Jim Murphy, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie faced off in a live TV election debate last night Overall, Scots prefer more public spending ahead of paying off the deficit – but also favour the Government's welfare cap. However, there is also widespread support for a Mansion Tax and an increase in the top rate of income tax to 50p. Mark Diffley, Director, Ipsos MORI Scotland said: 'The poll gives a clear steer about where the economic priorities for voters in Scotland lie. 'Broadly, Scots want to see measures to improve the standard of living, particularly a higher minimum wage, rises in pensions and lower energy bills. 'There is also a preference for higher targeted public spending even if that means the deficit is not eliminated in the next five years and targeted tax increases for those with the greatest income and wealth.'",

    "document": "Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has urged his players to shut the Champions League out of their minds and concentrate on extending their lead at the top of the La Liga table on Saturday. Victory over fourth-placed Valencia will take Enrique's men at least temporarily five points clear at the top of the table with title rivals Real Madrid not kicking off against Malaga until evening. But with Valencia visiting the Nou Camp in the midst of a 10-match unbeaten run Enrique has stressed the importance of forgetting Wednesday night's superb 3-1 semi-final first leg win in Paris. Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has urged his side to switch their attention back to the La Liga title race Luis Suarez starred in Barcelona's 3-1 Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain by bagging a brace Barcelona midfielder Andreas Iniesta has been ruled out of his side's league encounter against Valencia Enrique said: 'We are not thinking about the PSG match, we are only thinking about the visit of Valencia. 'Mentally we will have no problems because the players know if they are not 100 per cent against Valencia things will get complicated, but physically there are one or two things we have to assess.' Andreas Iniesta is definitely ruled out for Barca after he was forced off early in the second half of the 3-1 win in the French capital with a bruised pelvis. Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo insisted he was impressed but undaunted by Barca's performance over PSG as his side look to pull off a shock win which will strengthen their grip on fourth place. Santo said: 'What we have seen confirms what we already thought. They are a great team with great players. They don't have many weaknesses, but they do have some.' Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti knows his side have plenty of reasons to be wary as they look to keep up the pressure on the leaders with victory over seventh-placed Malaga. Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been ruled out of his side's La Liga match against Malaga Benzema rolls around on the floor during Real Madrid's quarter-final clash against rivals Atletico Real Madrid attacking midfielder Isco is expected to replace the injured Benzema for Saturday's clash Malaga pulled off a stunning 1-0 win over Barcelona in the Nou Camp in June and Ancelotti has warned his players they must wipe thoughts of their Champions League semi-final against city rivals Atletico if they are to avoid a similar fate. Ancelotti, who is without the injured Karim Benzema, said: 'Malaga played very well against Atletico (last week), performing with a lot of intensity and quality. They beat Barcelona at home and we need to focus on this match in order to win it.' Atletico Madrid will look to consolidate their grip on third place as they travel to a Deportivo La Coruna side for whom two successive draws has left them sitting above the relegation zone on goal difference alone. James Rodriguez (left) is likely to play in a central attacking role alongside club team-mate Isco Gareth Bale (pictured) and Cristiano Ronaldo will be tasked with scoring goals in Benzema's absence Bale sprints ahead of Luka Modric during Friday's training session ahead of Real's clash against Malaga Also on Saturday, mid-table Athletic Bilbao look to return to winning ways after three games without a victory as they take on Getafe, for whom three games unbeaten have effectively ended relegation fears. Sunday's action switches to the relegation zone with Almeria looking to build on their potentially priceless win over Granada last week and put space between themselves and the drop zone with victory at Rayo Vallecano. Granada hunt for their first league win in six at home to Sevilla while bottom-placed Cordoba's survival hopes will be all but over if they fail to take the points at Europe-chasing Villarreal. Celta Vigo travel to Eibar while the Monday match sees Elche look to ease relegation fears at home to David Moyes' Real Sociedad.",

    "document": "A 14-year-old Pennsylvania girl allegedly conspired with her 20-year-old soldier boyfriend to have her mother killed, texting him hours before the woman was stabbed to death, 'I want her gone,' it emerged today. Jamie Silvonek was charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin announced Thursday. Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was fatally stabbed in the driveway of her Upper Macungie Township home early March 15, hours after taking Jamie Silvonek and the eighth-grader's boyfriend, Army Spc. Caleb Barnes, to a concert, according to court documents. Scroll down for video Star-crossed lovers: Jamie Silvonek (left), 14, and her boyfriend, 20-year-old Army Spc Caleb Barnes (right), have been charged with killing the girl's mother for trying to break them up Barnes, who was on leave from Fort Meade in Maryland at the time of the slaying, was previously charged with homicide. He confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. Slain in cold blood: Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was stabbed several times in the neck inside her car after driving her daughter and Barnes from a concert The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, given the age disparity. 'There has to be some type of duress or coercion,' he said. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. 'She cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom, and told me she was coerced, she was afraid she was going to be killed, she was afraid her dad was going to be killed,' Waldron told The Associated Press. 'So there's a lot of things we have to decipher here.' Authorities said Barnes and Jamie Silvonek met in October — when she was 13 — but that she told him she was 17. He joined the military in February of 2012. Barnes graduated advanced training from the Presidio of Monterey, California, and his awards include the Good Conduct Medal and National Defense Service Medal, Army Times reported. Cheryl Silvonek found out about their relationship in early March and ordered the couple to break up, according to court documents. A day later, the teenager told Barnes she wanted her parents dead, the documents said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. Police found the victim's blood-soaked car submerged in a pond and traced it to the Silvonek family's home in Upper Macungie Township (pictured) Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' The teenager then texted Barnes: 'She threatened to throw me out of the house. I want her gone,' the affidavit said. Later, she allegedly wrote to him: 'Just do it.' Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. 'I can't stand her lying to you like this,' Jamie wrote to Barnes. 'SHE IS LYING ABOUT MY AGE,' reported Lehigh Valley Live. Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Lies: Barnes and Jamie Silvonek met in October — when she was 13 — but that she told him she was 17 Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. the 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension.",

    "document": "They have become one of the most irritating accessories carried by tourists in recent years, but it appears the selfie stick has been a nuisance for three decades. Hiroshi Ueda, a photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company Minolta, claims that he first invented the selfie stick in the 1980s. He said he came up with the idea after struggling to get pictures of himself and his wife together while they were in Europe. Scroll down for video Hiroshi Ueda, holding his extender stick for taking 'selfies' which he patented in 1983 while working for Minolta After having his camera stolen by a child he asked to take their picture in the Louvre Museum in Paris, he dreamed up a solution - an extendable stick with a tripod screw at the end. The 'extender stick', as he called it, was designed for use with new compact cameras that were being developed at the time. Whether taking in a spectacular panorama, visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert; the chances are your view has been ruined by  a selfie stick on at least one occasion. Now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse, because there’s a next-generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone. The contraption lets selfie addicts take photos  of themselves using their iPad, ensuring they can capture the best possible duck pout or cheesy grin in their shots. The supersized stick is available on the website Accessory Geeks for just $23 (£16), suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon. He added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing. Despite being patented in 1983, the extender stick failed to become a success - mainly due to the poor image quality it captured. But that did not stop Mr Ueda from compiling a family album of family 'selfies' using his device. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'The idea of taking a picture of yourself was very new back then. 'The philosophy behind it was that I didn't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - I could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever I liked.' Some 30 years later selfie sticks are now hugely popular - used by narcissists and celebrities everywhere to capture images of themselves in their surroundings. They have become such a menace that many tourist venues, museums, concert venues and stadiums have banned them. Perhaps ironically, Apple - the company that could be blamed for kickstarting the selfie phenomenon by putting a camera on the front of its phones in the first place - has also banned them from its next conference. Mr Ueda used his 'extender stick' to take pictures of himself with his family while on holiday in Europe (above) Modern versions of the extender stick allow a smartphone to be held aloft and use a remote trigger to take the photograph or video. Mr Ueda's patent ran out in 2003, however, so he has not benefited from the recent boom. Instead Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm developed a hand-held extendable selfie stick in the early 2000s, which he called the Quik Pod. While his product has sold well, there are many others available. Mr Ueda said: 'My idea came too early, but that's just one of those things. 'I patented about 300 ideas, so that was just one of them. We call it a 3am invention - it arrived too early.' The idea of selfies, however, is not new. Remote timers and triggers have been available on cameras for decades. A recently unearthed photograph also showed that some early photographers adopted unusual methods to take their own photo - such as using a broom handle to hit the trigger on their camera. Michael Pritchard, Director-General of The Royal Photographic Society, said there is evidence of selfies going back as far as the 1840s. Selfie sticks divide opinion - some people love them and others hate them. But a growing number of venues and attractions have deemed them such a nuisance that they are banning their use. Last month the National Gallery in London became the latest major museum to instruct visitors that the devices were not welcome. It follows bans in galleries in France and America – including the Palace of Versailles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Organisers of two major US festivals have also made clear what they think of selfie sticks. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds. According to NME , London's O2 Arena and Wembley Arena have also prohibited them, while Rome's Colosseum also do not permit the use of the gadgets.

Chris Roberts, who featured in a string of Fox News reports, was yanked off his plane after it landed in Syracuse, New York, on Wednesday night by two FBI agents and two uniformed officers. Roberts, who works for security intelligence company One World Labs, was questioned for the next four hours. Scroll down for video Chris Roberts of One World Labs was grabbed after his plane landed in Syracuse, New York, on Wednesday Roberts has been featured on the Fox News television show On the Record with Greta Van Susteren (left) The FBI agents took electronic devices and computer files from Roberts and confiscated his laptop and thumb drives, Fox News reported. They asked to forensically image his laptop, but Roberts told the agents to get a warrant. He was coming to town to speak at an aerospace conference about vulnerabilities in airplane systems and did make a presentation at the event on Thursday without the use of his electronics. The incident occurred only a few hours after a report about Roberts' research was released by Fox. Roberts said in the report: 'We can still take planes out of the sky thanks to the flaws in the in-flight entertainment systems. 'Quite simply put, we can theorize on how to turn the engines off at 35,000 feet and not have any of those damn flashing lights go off in the cockpit.' Experts worry planes' flight and entertainment systems could be compromised by terrorist hacking (file photo) The Government Accountability Office released a report earlier this week with similar findings. The GAO report stated: 'According to cybersecurity experts we interviewed, Internet connectivity in the cabin should be considered a direct link between the aircraft and the outside world, which includes potential malicious actors.' Roberts is scheduled to fly home Friday and is already pre-checked through the TSA. He said: 'You have one element in the FBI reaching out to people like me for help, but another element doing a hell of a job burning those bridges. 'Those of us who do threat research are doing it for the right reasons, and we work to build relationships with the intelligence community because we want to help them identify weaknesses before they become a problem.'",

    "document": "What does Republican senator and presidential contender Rand Paul have in common with a gun-toting, stripper-hurling playboy? An avid interest in poker, as it turns out. On Friday, the 52-year-old libertarian lawmaker from Kentucky shared a Snapchat video of himself learning how to play poker from the infamous ‘King of Instagram’ Dan Blizerian. The 10-second video, obtained by Daily Caller reporter Kaitlin Collins, is titled ‘Lessons from Dan Blizerian.’ Scroll down for video Strange bedfellows: On Friday, Senator Rand Paul (left) shared a Snapchat video of himself learning how to play poker from the debauched social media star Dan Blizerian (right) High stakes: The pair were playing Liar's Poker - a game where players use dollars bills instead of cards and track the serial numbers on the banknotes All about the Benjamins: The GOP senator and the professional poker player had $100 bills in their hands In the clip, the two men sit at a table opposite one another with money fans in their hands, playing what appears to be Liar's Poker - a game where players use dollars bills instead of cards and track the serial numbers on the banknotes. The goal of the game, according to Investopedia.com, is to bluff the opponents into believing that your bid does not exceed the combined sum of all of the serial numbers. Collins reported that Paul and Blizerian were playing with $100 bills. Liar's Poker is also the title of a book by bestselling author Michael Lewis about the dissolute, everything-goes culture of Wall Street bond salesmen in the 1980s. Blizerian is a renowned professional poker player and self-described international playboy who has amassed 8million followers on his Instagram page, where he documents his globe-trotting, hard-partying lifestyle. Odd couple: There does not appear to be much overlap between the married 52-year-old doctor-turned-lawmaker and the 34-year-old globe-trotting, hard-partying playboy THAT video: Blizerian made headlines last year when this video was released showing him hurling an 18-year-old porn star from the roof of his mansion into the pool Gun lover: In December, the former Navy SEAL trainee was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport for allegedly trying to manufacture a bomb In a profile published in the Wall Street Journal in 2014, Blizerian estimated earning about $50miillion in poker winnings in just over a year. Most of the images on his social media account feature young, attractive women in various states of undress, stacks of cash, yachts, supercars and wild clothing-optional parties. The poker champ and one-time Navy SEAL trainee also has been known to share with his fans pictures of his large weapons collection, which he lovingly refers to as his ‘accessories.’ Blizerian made headlines last year when a video was released showing him hurling an 18-year-old porn star from the roof of his mansion into the pool, leaving her with a broken foot. Viral sensation: Blizerian is a renowned professional poker player and self-described international playboy who has amassed 8million followers on his Instagram page Playboy: Nearly every day he shares photos of himself surrounded by shapely, scantily clad young women Booted out: Blizerian was kicked off Snapchat just 24 hours after activating his account for posting a video of naked women in his bed Then in December, Blizerian was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport for allegedly trying to manufacture a bomb. Blizerian managed to avoid jail time after agreeing to pay a $10,000 fine and produce a public information film on responsible firearm use.

Dressed in a tuxedo, and running into a packed assembly hall where Kristelle was waiting, unaware of what was going on, Mr Garza performed a rendition of Heath Ledger's famous scene in Ten Things I Hate About You, singing Lauren Hill's Can't Take My Eyes Off of You. Arresting: Palmdale, California student Davyeon was 'arrested' in his lunchroom thanks to prom date Stephanie. No word on how much she bribed the officer who cuffed him Not always pricey: Mike Ramirez, student at Crosby High School in suburban Houston, managed to get Texans cheerleader Caitlyn to go to the prom with him by getting 10,000 retweets Jamie Vandenberg from Ontario, Canada, promposed to his girlfriend Madison Dillion using a fake pop quiz that his teacher distributed at the beginning of class. As students reached question three, where Mr Vanenberg laid out statistical quandaries to Miss Dillon's yes or no answer, they realized their probability questionnaire was a ruse. When student Taylor Huestis opened her locker, 456 ping pong balls, all with 'prom' written on them, fell onto the floor. Huestis' boyfriend had planned the stunt for days, enlisting the help of her friends; his sign read 'I finally had the balls to ask you to prom!' Visa's prom survey also revealed some interesting regional and economic disparities. This year, Canadians plan to spend $508 overall on prom of which $151 will be on promposal, compared to $919 overall for U.S. families. Dads plan to outspend moms by 63%, $1160vs. $710.

    "document": "Glasgow Warriors have confirmed that experienced duo Al Kellock and Dougie Hall will both start Friday night's Guinness PRO12 match with Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun. Both skipper Kellock and Hall - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of May and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers. And while Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was naming his full squad for the Blues match on Thursday, he announced that the second-row and hooker would start in the pack against the Welsh outfit. Glasgow Warriors veteran Al Kellock will start at lock against Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night The encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and, in a nice touch by the club, the match ball will be presented by Kellock's dad and Hall's mum along with Alistair Johnson, who was Kellock's best man, and Bernie Mitchell, who was an inspirational figure for Hall coming through at Hillhead/Jordanhill. Having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 Scotland caps, Hall admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign. 'You get to a point where you start thinking to yourself 'this could be the last game of rugby I ever play' so you want to make the most of it,' the 34-year-old said. 'I really want to enjoy these last few games, but also stay focused and help the Warriors secure a play-off place and hopefully the trophy. Glasgow hooker Dougie Hall is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby As retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game. You start to think about your last team huddle, the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that I will miss incredibly.' Since he first played in the equivalent of the PRO12 for Edinburgh Rugby back in 2002/03 Hall has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly. As a result, despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table, he does not expect an easy night, far from it. 'They have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year,' he explained. 'We really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play-offs in the coming weeks. 'I hope that gone are the days when the PRO12 is looked on as a lesser league, the teams and the talent involved now really is top class.' Gregor Townsend's Glasgow side are currently top of the Pro12 standings ahead of Cardiff's visit This season Hall has been restricted to seven appearances in the PRO12 for the Warriors to date, Fraser Brown and Pat MacArthur playing the majority of minutes with Kevin Bryce also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey. And while Hall himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio, he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run-in and in the play-offs. 'The last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym,' Hall explained. 'For me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field I can give it everything. 'As you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group, but I like to think I have acted like that since I came to the Warriors in 2007. Wales prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for Cardiff as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain 'I was the starting hooker for a number of years and as Pat, and more recently, Fraser and Kevin have come in I hope they have learnt from watching what I do and also have learnt from what I say too.' Meanwhile, Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match with a calf strain. The injury forced the Wales and British & Irish Lions' man off last week in his side's European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat to the Dragons. 'Gethin has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought. He hasn't trained this week so is a doubt, but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season,' Blues attack coach Paul John said. 'We want to play to a game plan, execute well and perform to the best of our ability. To do justice to the league we have to do that. 'Glasgow are a good offloading side, they are a complete side in many ways, and we've got to control the ball better than we did last weekend.'",

He was so big that it took Shepherd John Hendy and a team of three helpers to help mother Jean deliver the young lamb near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, who they've now named Big Ben. Suffolk black lamb Jean is seven years old and an experienced mother but Ben is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him, all weighing the average weight of 8-10lbs. Big Ben: the 20lb lamb is twice the weight of the average new-born, towering over peers Proud mum: Jean with huge son Big Ben after a three-hour labour at a Leicestershire farm Ben isn't the biggest lamb ever born in this country but Jean Morris from the farm said Big Ben was comfortably the biggest they have ever delivered. 'I don't think there was anything unusual about either parent and this is the first time we have bred a lamb as large as this,' she said. 'His mother must have been relieved when it was over.' She added that the farm hopes to keep Ben as a breeding ram in the hope he will pass his amazing features to his future flock. 'This year we had 86 ewes to lamb but no-one expected anyone like him,' she said. 'We are thinking about keeping him as a tup - a breeding ram - to see if he passes on his weight to the lambs he sires.' Almost as big as a person: Ben dwarfs the other 86 ewes born at the same farm this season Ben's arrival came just a fortnight after the largest lamb born in the UK weighed in at a massive 24lbs in north Wales. He was named The Big One and is believed to be the heaviest lamb ever born in the wild. Last year Goliath was born at a hefty 22lbs 5oz in Wellington in Somerset. The title for the heaviest Suffolk cross lamb was Bruno, nicknamed 'Woooly Lamboth', who was born in Worcestershire in 2009 at a healthy 21lbs. Bruno was spared the chop because of his size as his owner decided to keep him as a pet because he was curious to know just how big he would get. New Zealand is the world's biggest producer of lambs. But the largest new-born lamb ever recorded there weighed just 15.5lbs.",

    "document": "Eden Hazard has admitted an intense campaign with Chelsea may have left him too tired to perform at the best of his ability after he was substituted just 62 minutes into Belgium's win over Israel on Tuesday. Hazard has played 48 games this season for club and country, missing just five matches for Chelsea and being an ever-present in their Barclays Premier League title charge. But as Belgium struggled to a hard-fought 1-0 win over Israel in European Championship qualifying group B, Hazard was withdrawn by manager Marc Wilmots with 28 minutes to go having found it difficult to get the better of his marker Orel Dgani. Eden Hazard has admitted an intense campaign with Chelsea may have left him too tired to perform at his best Hazard was substituted with 28 minutes In Belgium's 1-0 win over Israel in Jerusalem on Tuesday night The 24-year-old playmaker has played all but five of Chelsea's games this season, mainly avoiding injury The 24-year-old playmaker was clearly unhappy to have been substituted and looked to shoot Wilmots a disapproving look as he left the field to be replaced by Nacer Chadli before questioning the manager on his decision after the game. ‘I was a little bit surprised to be substituted,' Hazard said. 'Also, I was a little bit unhappy and I think you could see that I was unhappy. ‘I asked the coach for a reason and he told me that I was tired. Maybe I was a little bit tired. I’ve played a lot of games this season.’ In his post-match comments, Wilmots added: ‘Hazard is not hurt, but I had the impression that he was tired. In these kind of games, you have to react immediately because we did not have time.' Belgium manager Marc Wilmots said he felt that Hazard looked tired, something the player questioned him on Hazard scored early on in Chelsea's last game, a 3-2 win over Hull City, but the team were pegged back Hazard is unlikely to get an extended rest any time soon as he returns to Premier League action on Saturday Belgium captain Vincent Kompany was sent off for a second yellow card within two minutes of Hazard's withdrawal, leaving Belgium clinging on to their slender lead, and Wilmots admitted he may not have substituted his star man had he known his side would be down to 10 men. Despite his admission, Hazard is unlikely to get an extended rest any time soon as he returns to Premier League action with the visit of Stoke City to Stamford Bridge on Saturday. And with a tough run-in and another international break still to come, the Belgian forward could rack up as many as 59 appearances by the time the season finally ends in mid-June. Belgium's win in Jerusalem saw them return to the top of their qualifying group, ahead of Wales on goal difference. They travel to face them in Cardiff in their next competitive game on June 12.

    "document": "Our young Earth may have collided with a body similar to the planet Mercury, says a new paper. The dramatic event could explain why our planet has a hot core that gives it its magnetic field. And it could also explain why certain rare-earth elements in Earth’s mantle do not seem to originate from the planet’s other building blocks - meteorites. Oxford scientists say a Mercury-like body struck the young Earth (artist's illustration shown). The object would have been the heat source for our planet's core. The same object could have been responsible for creating the moon. It also explains where some rare-Earth elements came from The study, by two scientists from the University of Oxford, was published in the journal Nature. Our current theory of Earth’s formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. However, this model cannot explain where the heat source for Earth’s core - and ultimately its magnetic field - came from. In addition, Earth’s crust and mantle appear to have a higher ratio of the rare-earth elements samarium and neodymium than most meteorites - suggesting there was more at play in Earth’s formation than first thought. To address this discrepancy, scientists believe that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars - but like Mercury in its composition - early in its life. This likely would have happened about 4.5 billion years ago. The body would have been rich in sulphur but very poor in oxygen - just like Mercury. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. But one mystery has persisted, revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition? Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon. Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon. Or Theia could have, coincidentally, been isotopically similar to young Earth. A third possibility is that the moon formed from Earthen materials, rather than from Theia, although this would have been a very unusual type of impact. Our current theory of Earth’s (left) formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. Now scientists think that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars, but like Mercury (right) in its composition, early in its life. In the young solar system 4.5 billion years ago, illustrated, various planetesimals and other small bodies coalesced together to form larger bodies like Earth As it collided with Earth, it would have produced radioactive uranium and thorium, generating the heat needed to drive the ‘dynamo’ of molten iron in Earth’s core. And they do not rule out the possibility that this is the same Mars-sized body that formed the moon. ‘We think that that is quite conceivable,’ said study co-author Bernard Wood, reported the LA Times. ‘It's kind of exciting to think that this reduced body could actually be the thing which caused the moon.’ In an accompanying News and Views article for Nature, Dr Richard Carlson of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC said the theory could open up new avenues for thought.. For example, if true, it would raise further questions about ‘how Earth ended up in its present oxidised state, which it has apparently retained for more than three billion years.’",

    "document": "(CNN)Think it's hard to redeem your miles for an airline award ticket? It depends on which airline rewards program you've chosen, which route you're flying and when you book your ticket, according to a new Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years. The magazine collected statistics comparing award-seat availability for the five biggest U.S. airlines on domestic routes. The top performer was Southwest Airlines, which offered the most award tickets, 11.9 million, and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats. \"The high number of award tickets is directly related to Southwest's unique combination of 'Every Seat is an Award Seat,' no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the U.S. and beyond, making us the largest domestic carrier in the U.S.,\" Southwest spokesperson Thais Conway Hanson told CNN. \"Unlike other carriers, we also don't charge fees for close-in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up.\" At the bottom of the list was JetBlue, which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest U.S. airlines: 892,000 one-way passenger tickets, or 4.5% of its total 19.7 million U.S. seats. (JetBlue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study.) Many JetBlue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year, making it hard to accumulate miles, an airline spokesman told the magazine. By not allowing miles to expire anymore, the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them. Delta Air Lines came in second place with 5.6 million U.S. award seats; United Airlines ranked third with 5 million U.S. award tickets; and American Airlines was fourth with 3.5 million U.S. award seats. What are the world's safest airlines? Remember that award tickets aren't actually free. The cost of miles is built into everything you buy that's earning you miles, and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all. So it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully. On average, nearly 10% of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by Consumer Reports flew on domestic award tickets, but some of them weren't getting the best value for their miles. While many U.S. fliers redeemed miles on American Airlines flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket, Consumer Reports says. Better to use them on American Airlines' route between New York and San Francisco or Delta's route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which are generally more expensive than that Los Angeles-San Francisco route, according to Consumer Reports' calculations. While award-seat availability is important, it may not matter as much as passengers' overall satisfaction with an airline. Southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score (86), followed by JetBlue (85), Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). And don't forget the fees. Southwest doesn't charge any fees, while other airlines tack on fees for checking bags, booking by phone, changing plans and more.",

    "document": "Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered £20 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.'

    "document": "A nervous Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta on Friday to watch her beau Tiger Woods in his quest for a fifth Masters title - and fifth green jacket. And while it was a good day Woods, the golfing great still had some stressful moments and still has a way to go in catching up to leader, 21-year-old Jordan Spieth. Heading into the weekend he is a very, very distant 12 strokes behind a seemingly unstoppable Spieth, with 36 holes left to play. Scroll down for video Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta Friday to watch boyfriend Tiger Woods (above) play in the second round of the Masters Vonn (above) looked stressed at times though Woods played a solid round, carding a three-under-par 69 Woods is still well behind the leader, hot young American star Jordan Spieth (above) This as Woods, competing after a two-month absence to retool his game, showed flashes of his old magic as he fired his best score at the Masters in four years in Friday's second round. The former world number one has been under intense scrutiny after struggling badly with his chipping when last seen on the PGA Tour but he played solidly at steamy Augusta National to card a three-under-par 69. That left Woods at two-under 142, far behind the pacesetting American Spieth, but still delighted to be in contention after working hard to resurrect his game. If Spieth wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in Masters history with Woods This was Vonn's second day in a row cheering on Woods 'I'm still right there,' 14-time major winner Woods said of his position going into the weekend 'I was at a pretty low one (point) in my career,' Woods said after mixing four birdies with a bogey to climb into a tie for 14th when he ended his round. 'To basically change an entire (swing) pattern like that and put it together, put it in a position where I can compete in a major championship like this is something I'm very proud of.' Woods, who plunged to 111th in the rankings as he struggled to return to form following back surgery last year and his fifth swing change, again struggled with the pace of Augusta National's heavily contoured greens. 'I had a hard time getting the ball close to the hole,' said Woods. 'You expect certain putts to roll out, but they're not rolling out.' Watched by huge galleries, Woods made a fast start, hitting a superb approach to seven feet at the par-four first and rolling in the birdie putt as shouts of 'Watch out, Tiger's back' and 'Come on Tiger, let's go' rang out. Spieth, 21, broke the 36 hole record on Friday and is 14-under-par for the tournament, 12 strokes ahead of Woods His only bogey came at the par-three sixth, his tee shot ending up just off the back of the green from where he had 45 feet to the flag but hit a weak chip that advanced just 20 feet. Woods immediately rebounded in birdie-birdie style, draining a 25-footer at the tricky seventh and hitting his third shot at the par-five eighth to two feet. He birdied the 11th after conjuring a moment of magic from the pine straw to the right of the fairway, a soaring approach settling 12 feet from the cup. 'I'm still right there,' the 14-time major winner said of his position going into the weekend. 'I'm 12 back, but there's not a lot of guys ahead of me. And with 36 holes here to go, anything can happen.'",

    "document": "A 20-year-old British tourist has claimed she was molested by a taxi driver in Jaipur, who has now been arrested (pictured posed by model) A taxi driver in India has been arrested after being accused of molesting a British tourist. The driver, known as Salim, is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in Jaipur on Friday evening. The man, from Todabhim in Karauli district of Rajasthan, is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody. A spokesman for Rajasthan Police said they had taken statements from the woman and her friend, India Times reported. 'We have arrested taxi driver Salim on a complaint filed by a British tourist on early Saturday.' said the man. 'He was arrested under Section 354 of IPC (Indian Penal Code). He was sent to judicial custody,' His arrest follows a number of incidents reported to have taken place in India against tourists and locals, which have led to widespread protests. On February 8 a Japanese tourist filed a complaint accusing a tout of raping her in Dudu, around 60km away from Jaipur. The woman had been on a tour when the man allegedly approached her and offered his service as a guide. In March a 75-year-old Indian nun was gang raped by a group of eight robbers when she confronted them after they broke in to the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal state's Nadia district. There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times. Later Nagaland Government said he was innocent.",

Amateur champion Bradley Neil missed the cut on his debut at the Masters The Scot admitted he needed to 'give himself a kick up the a***' after struggling on the professional tour 'I've prepared well for this but this shows it's not been enough. Sandy was great. Putting is one of the best parts of my game but I struggled with it and he pointed something out and I'll take that on board. 'I'm very jealous of him, he gets to come back (here) every year. That's something I want to do in the future. I think I'm good enough to get back here, I think I have the game to do that. I need to give myself a right kick up the arse after this. I'm desperate to come back.' Neil still harboured hopes of making the cut after his first round, but carded four bogeys, a double bogey and one birdie to cover the front nine in 41, before coming home in 38. 'You know how tough this place is before you get here but any expectations you have are blown out of the water,' he added. 'You don't realise how tough it is until you play it. You watch it so much on TV but you can't believe the difference. Neil was playing with fellow countryman and former Masters winner Sandy Lyle 'It deserves all the respect it gets. It's the best in the world, the toughest in the world. It's been a game of two halves the last few days. It's been taking a step forward and then taking two back. I couldn't get one up on the course, it just kept coming back at me. 'I'm disappointed with the last two days, I've done worse here than I did at the Open (missing the cut on 11 over at Hoylake). 'I thought this would suit me better than the Open. My season has been disappointing so far but I'm playing against world-class fields and bigger, better courses than I was on the amateur circuit. I need to work my socks off. Last year I found it easy on the amateur scene.'",

    "document": "Juventus striker Carlos Tevez has refuted claims suggesting he will rejoin Boca Juniors in the summer by insisting he is yet to make a decision on his future. Tevez has said throughout his career that he wanted to end his career at his boyhood club but it appears the Argentine outfit will have to wait for his signature. The 31-year-old's future was thrown into doubt when Boca Juniors president Daniel Angelici claimed he was 'close to bringing Carlos home' despite Tevez having another year on his current deal. Juventus striker Carlos Tevez is yet to make a final decision on his future despite constant links to Boca Talk of a return to his boyhood side intensified when Tevez replicated his famous Boca Juniors celebration Tevez pulled off the 'chicken dance' after scoring a crucial goal during Boca's 2-0 win over River Plate in 2004 And the link was made even stronger over the weekend as Tevez celebrated his strike against Lazio in a similar fashion to when he scored a vital goal for Boca Juniors against River Plate back in 2004. However Tevez has thrown cold water over the 'chicken dance' interpretation by telling Sky Sport Italia: 'That game [against River] does not come into it. 'I celebrated like that because I promised my people that I would and I will do the same if I score against Monaco [on Wednesday]. 'As for my future, enough! It's not right to speak about me. Juve are what count. 'Both Juve and I are going through an extraordinary moment and I'm thinking only of Juve right now. 'I don't know if I will leave. I've not yet decided what to do. 'But it's not right to speak about it now and, as I said, the Bianconeri fans will be the first to know what I decide.'",

The Spaniard has found his best form at a crucial part of the season, with a place in the Champions League all but sealed and an opportunity to finish second a real possibility. United are currently above rivals Manchester City by one point and looking for a top two finish - where they can qualify automatically for the group stages - but Mata knows his side can't afford to slip-up in the final seven games. Juan Mata (right) says Manchester United need to look at the next seven Premier League games as 'finals' The 26-year-old has been in fine form for Louis van Gaal's side during their five game winning run 'The season has gone so quickly – it seems we were in pre-season only a few months ago. But we still have some finals left before the end,' he told MUTV. 'We want to finish as high as we can and I think we can win a lot of games between now and the end of the season if we perform like we did in the last few games. 'We are facing two or three very big rivals like Chelsea, City and Arsenal so we need to be at our best level to beat them. Each game is a final and we have to think about each one on their own. 'So now we are thinking about Sunday [against City] and then we will think about the next one. Every point is very important from now until the end and we will look at every game as a final.'

    "document": "Rival clubs claim QPR, facing Football League fines of up to £50million for multiple breaches of financial fair play regulations, are making an outrageous attempt to get their man on the inside of the discussions. Football League board member Jim Rodwell’s departure from Notts County to become chief executive of Scunthorpe has created the need for an election for a League One representative as Rodwell cannot automatically keep his place. League One clubs have been informed that there are two nominations for the vacant seat — Rodwell and former Manchester United director Maurice Watkins, now chairman of Barnsley. Tony Fernandes, owner of QPR, wants to avoid fines of up to £50million for Financial Fair Play breaches Maurice Watkins is a sports lawyer whose firm represents QPR over their considerable FFP troubles QPR are 19th in the Premier League, four points away from escaping the relegation zone Watkins is a sports lawyer and his firm Brabners are representing QPR over their considerable FFP troubles. Clubs believe that having Watkins on the Football League board, where FFP is the hot topic, would be helpful for QPR and a massive conflict of interests. However, the highly-respected Watkins, who has a number of sporting directorships including British Swimming and Lancashire County Cricket Club, dismissed the conspiracy theory as ‘wholly ludicrous’. Raheem Sterling’s stand-off with Liverpool over a new contract is not just to do with him. It will suit Sterling’s representative Aidy Ward, who split with Rob Segal’s Impact Sports Management to set up on his own earlier this season, if any new deal is delayed until his parting from Segal has been finalised. Aidy Ward (left) is Raheem Sterling's agent and is a key player in his contract negotiations with Liverpool Raheem Sterling (left) pictured with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (right) at Liverpool training The five former England managers who signed the letter supporting Greg Dyke’s homegrown players’ campaign had nothing to do with writing the missive. It was the work of the FA’s support agency on the issue, Milltown Partners. Certainly, Sven Goran Eriksson and Kevin Keegan  did nothing for the homegrown situation when club managers — Keegan even shut down Newcastle reserves. Greg Dyke, the Football Association chairman, wants to more homegrown players playing in England Kevin Keegan's name is one of five former England managers to sign a letter supporting Dyke's idea However, Milltown are at least helping the FA fight the PR battle toe-to-toe against the all-powerful Premier League, who ironically have used Milltown for crisis management advice in the past. England cricket head coach Peter Moores’ considerable good fortune at surviving such a World Cup humiliation extends to the ECB board meeting reviewing that debacle being next Thursday. By then Moores will be preparing for the first Test against West Indies starting four days later. England cricket head coach Peter Moores (right) will soon begin a review into England's World Cup failure Moores (left) oversaw England's humiliating group stage exit from the Cricket World Cup If the postmortem had occurred earlier it is difficult to see how Moores could still be in charge. The breakdown in the relationship between the FA and England Supporters Travel Club led to the offensive chants during England’s 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday. The tasteless repertoire of songs ran from ‘F*** the IRA’, to ‘F*** the Taliban’ to ‘F*** the English FA’ — the last one due to the huge discontent over the decision to switch double loyalty caps from away trips to home games at Wembley. Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs — and the World War Two favourites — will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues. Staging Rugby World Cup games at Leicester City’s King Power Stadium rather than the sport’s Welford Road stronghold continues to be a problem for organisers. The loyal Leicester rugby public want little to do with their football neighbours, whose three group fixtures are a long way from being sold out. Radio 5 Live’s loveable football commentator Alan Green was not happy at being asked to pay city tax on checking out of Turin’s Hotel Carlina after the England game. Green was overheard at reception moaning it was BBC’s responsibility to settle the bill and not his. But Green eventually had to cough up…all of seven euros.

Everton manager Martinez felt Coleman had been barged by home striker Marvin Emnes before the Irish right-back scooped away the ball with his hands. And Martinez claimed referee Michael Oliver should have risen above the appeals from the Swansea faithful and used 'common sense' to rule in favour of Everton. Seamus Coleman falls over under the challenge from Marvin Emnes and handles the ball Coleman appears to apologise to the visiting fans at the full-time whistle, but his manager says he was fouled Martinez said on BT Sport 1: 'My thoughts are that straight away there is contact. Seamus tells me straight away there is contact and he gets unbalanced. 'Sometimes you need to apply a little bit of common sense. 'Clearly there's contact. I've seen it many times given as a free-kick. 'The whole action for me is too soft. I don't think that there's enough threat or a goalscoring threat to give a penalty. 'He's trying to protect the ball and gets unbalanced and from that point he expects the free-kick to be given. The Everton players protest but Michael Oliver deemed Coleman's handball deliberate, and gave a penalty Jonjo Shelvey made no mistake from the spot as the former Liverpool midfielder equalised for Swansea 'It's one of those actions where you expect the referee to be a little bit more above the occasion. 'You felt the crowd were asking for two or three decisions and it was building up to a decision and unfortunately we were on the receiving end.' Martinez labelled the result 'a real disappointment', after Aaron Lennon's first-half strike had looked set to give the visitors all three points. Jonjo Shelvey tucked away the penalty equaliser in the 69th minute. Martinez added: 'The only criticism is we had a period of 10, 15, 20 minutes where we were too comfortable in the second half and didn't find that final shot or try to score the second goal, but apart from that I do feel the draw doesn't reflect what happened.' Roberto Martinez was clearly angry with the referee's decision as his current side were held by his old club",

I am honored to join LPAC and help lead our effort to elect Hillary Clinton in 2016.' King, who was outed as a lesbian in 1981, was a leader of the group 'Women for Hillary' in 2008, as well. The video in which Hillary announced she was running for president included a clip of a lesbian couple The Twitter handle for the new group is @lezs4hillary Many gays and lesbians point to Clinton's 2011 speech in Switzerland as Secretary of State in which she declared: 'Human rights are gay rights and gay rights are human rights.' In the video released yesterday announcing Clinton's candidacy for president, two gay couples were included. Among them, two lesbians who look lovingly into each other's eyes. However, in her 2008 campaign, Clinton did not support gay marriage. It took her five years - to publicly say that she supported gay marriage. President Barack Obama publicly announced his support for gay marriage nearly a year earlier in March 2012. The Economist called Clinton's stance on gay marriage, 'cautious to the point of cowardice.' 'It is not convincing to argue, as her supporters do, that she is only free to make her views known now that she has stepped down as America's chief diplomat. Her successor at the State Department, John Kerry, and has not been stoned as a blasphemer on any of his stops around the world to date,' the magazine's US columnist wrote. Critics also point out that as First Lady, she did not oppose her husband signing 'Don't Ask Don't Tell,' which banned being openly gay in the military or the Defense of Marriage Act, which banned gay marriage at the federal level.",

His wife Audrey spent part of last week in an induced coma owing to a serious infection. Leishman left Augusta taking with him the best wishes of his sport. Marc Leishman has withdrawn from this year's competition to be with his wife Masters chairman Billy Payne talked a lot  about growing the game but he ruled out any idea of starting a women’s Masters. ‘We have a very short member season at Augusta National of seven months,’ he explained. ‘The time that we dedicate to the preparation and conduct of the tournament is already extensive. I don’t think we would ever host another one.’ Billy Payne has ruled out starting a women's Masters despite talking about growing the game It’s well-known the garish surroundings outside Augusta National contrast markedly with the beauty within. But maybe that’s about to change. After buying up all the houses on adjacent Berckmans Road and turning it into a patrons’ car park, Masters chairman Billy Payne is promising a ‘beautification’ project. ‘As you know, we’re pretty good at landscaping,’ he said. ‘It’s going to look nice, I promise.’ Mr Unpopular Bubba Watson can surely not have upset anyone with his choice of menu for the Champions Dinner on Tuesday. Clearly he enjoyed it so much two years ago he decided to stick with the same inoffensive offering: Caesar salad followed by grilled chicken breast with green beans, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and cornbread.

The humanoid, known as Ham, has been drawing in crowds with his incredible range of facial expressions at an electronics event in Hong Kong this week. The head, designed by American robotics designer David Hanson, is able to answer basic questions and can also be used in the simulation of medical scenarios. Scroll down for video Incredibly lifelike: Known as Ham, this humanoid is made using specialised software and can recognise and respond to facial expressions Ham is currently on exhibit at the Global Sources spring electronics show at AsiaWorld Expo - the largest event of its kind in the world, with more than 4,000 booths displaying the latest gadgets. The head is created with malleable material called Frubber using soft-bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology. It contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across (there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre). Using specialised software the machine can recognise and respond to a number of human facial expressions in a natural way. According to Hanson Robotics's website, the humanoids can actually see your face, make eye contact with you, and understand speech to 'engage you in witty dialogue'. Such reactions are a major feat of engineering, according to chief designer David Hanson, the founder and and president of Hanson Robotics. Reactive: The robot smiles using multiple motors - which whir into action and subtly adjust multiple points of articulation around his mouth and brown eyes State-of-the-art: The head is created with malleable material using soft-bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology. It contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across (there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre) It is not the first human-looking robot that his firm has created either. An earlier version of Ham drew headlines as it was sculpted to look like Albert Einstein, complete with a bushy moustache and a shock of white hair. The Einstein humanoid made facial expressions by using multiple motors - which whir into action and subtly adjust multiple points of articulation around his mouth and brown eyes. Mr Hanson sees robotics as his calling and works on many fronts, from sculpting features to developing artificial intelligence. To advance to the next step of producing robots for everyday applications in entertainment, health care and education, he decided to move to Hong Kong with his family - his wife Amanda and their son Zeno. The city has a booming robotics community with a high amount of expertise and design infrastructure and new technology can be developed at a lower cost than in the US.

Wellington is said to have more bars, restaurants and cafes per capita than New York – and they were certainly out in force during CubaDupa. More than 60 vendors were on hand on Saturday to serve food on the street, with many eateries setting up stalls outside their shops to draw people in.

    "document": "David Cameron this morning launched a furious attack on Labour MPs 'bleating' about poverty after it emerged more than a million people turned to food banks last year. The Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor'. He accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Scroll down for video The Prime Minister, delivering a major speech on the economy in Bedford today, said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor' Mr Cameron, in a major speech on the economy this morning, said the Tories were overhauling the benefit system, increasing the minimum wage and providing more free child care to help parents get to work. He added: ‘True compassion isn’t giving people a benefits cheque – it’s giving them a chance.’ He said Labour had left a system where a single mum, working 15 hours and earning £87 a week, would have actually lost money if she had taken on any more work. Mr Cameron said families stuck on benefits were not ‘playing the system’ but were ‘victims of it’. He said they were ‘victims of a welfare trap laid by Labour, paid for by hardworking taxpayers’. The PM added: That destroyed aspiration. It created resentment. And it was never meant to be this way. Welfare was meant to be a safety net – not a web from which no-one could escape. ‘So when I hear Labour politicians bleating on about the same old Tories, not on the side of working people, I just think: some brass neck. ‘It was you who trapped the poor on welfare and widened inequality. Yes, you Ed Miliband and Ed Balls who designed these systems that punished the lowest paid. So don’t you dare lecture us on poverty. ‘And know this – the true party of working people in Britain today is us, the Conservative Party.’ Mr Cameron accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Mr Cameron promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment. The Conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than £150,000 to fund additional free childcare places. ‘For many second earners, work didn’t pay because the cost of childcare was so high. So we introduced 15 hours of free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds and disadvantaged two-year-olds. ‘In the next Parliament we will double that for three- and four-year-olds. That’ s right – 30 hours of free childcare a week – worth £5,000 to working families. ‘That means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year – nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs – all by 2017.’ Mr Cameron also argued ‘that true compassion isn’t giving people a benefits cheque – it’s giving them a chance’. The new free childcare will be available where all parents in the household are working at least eight hours a week at the minimum wage. The new 30 hours entitlement will cost just under £350 million a year.",

    "document": "Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. The Crown Prosecution Service has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that Janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer’s disease. But now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an April 9 note to Lords authorities. Scroll down for video Controversy: Lord Janner, who will not face child sex charges because he has dementia, with his daughter, rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner Signed: The letter Lord Janner signed on April 9. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than £100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013. Last October he took a formal leave of absence from Parliament, allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months’ notice. New rules which came into effect last May provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks. But Janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior Lords official 12 days ago. A House of Lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself, but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his. Simon Danczuk, the Labour politician who exposed the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith’s horrific abuse of boys, said it was not right for Janner to stay in the Lords yet avoid court. ‘If you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator, then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law,’ he said. ‘If he has got a leave of absence from the Lords, that implies that he may get well. Why isn’t he retiring? It makes a mockery of it all. He is bringing the House of Lords into disrepute almost single-handedly.’ The Crown Prosecution Service faced widespread criticism after announcing that Janner (pictured) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer’s disease Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: ‘He couldn’t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis. ‘But if he isn’t compos mentis, there’s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature. How can they say he’s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting Nazi war criminals? ‘It stinks of the Establishment covering up and ensuring he doesn’t have to take the stand in public. This is a cover-up, there can be no question about it.’ Janner’s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was suspended by Labour after the CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. Allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children’s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. After Beck was jailed, many other politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby. Mr Ashby, 74, who stood down from Parliament in 1997 after being caught up in the Major government’s sleaze scandals, appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday. ‘Of course I didn’t know anything at the time,’ he said from his home in South-West London. ‘The man has dementia and should be left alone.’ Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Lord Janner's QC son Prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the Janner case. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Labour peer’s QC son. Neil Moore, who was based at the 23 Essex Street chambers where Daniel Janner works, was consulted by Mrs Saunders before she concluded not to prosecute. Senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about Mr Moore’s involvement in the decision-making process. But a spokesman for the UK’s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that Mr Moore informed her of the connection before any discussions took place. She said Mr Moore was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to Mr Janner for two years. The potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for Mrs Saunders as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision. Last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge Janner. Eleanor Laws QC recommended a ‘trial of the facts’ in the defendant’s absence to ‘get to the bottom of the allegations’. A CPS spokesman said: ‘It is the DPP’s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what the DPP has done.’",

    "document": "Warrington put a dampener on Kevin Sinfield's 500th appearance for Leeds as they completed a notable double over the Super League leaders in emphatic fashion at Headingley. Sinfield was on the losing side on his debut for the Rhinos against Sheffield Eagles at Headingley in 1997 and he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion, with the Wolves running out 29-10 winners. The Rhinos were already trailing 20-4 when the former England skipper entered the action five minutes into the second half and it did not get much better as the Yorkshiremen came up with their worst performance of the season in front of a 17,430 crowd. Warrington Wolves forward Roy Asotasi crosses for one of his side's five tries on the night Warrington had produced their best display in an 18-6 win over Leeds in March and they were again outstanding, with full-back Stefan Ratchford and second rower Ben Currie the pick of an impressive bunch. Leeds had an early chance when prop Adam Cuthbertson was held up over the line but then it was virtually all Warrington as they established a stranglehold on the game. Loose forward Ben Harrison was held up on his back before his back-row partner Currie produced a measured grubber kick on the last tackle to create a try for winger Gene Ormsby. Leeds Rhinos winger Kallum Watkins does brilliantly to touch down in the corner It was then Harrison's turn to demonstrate his kicking skills to get his captain Joel Monaghan in for a second try, although there was a strong hint of a forward pass in the build-up. With scrum-half Richie Myler causing all sorts of problems for the Rhinos defence with his penetrative running, the visitors were good value for their 8-0 lead and it got even better for them on 23 minutes when prop Ashton Sims took hooker Mick Higham's pass near the line to go through a gaping hole for a third try. Ratchford was off target with his first two attempts at goal but it was third time lucky as he made it 14-0 and a Higham 40-20 kick enabled Warrington to maintain the momentum. Warrington forward Ben Harrison is tackled by Stevie Ward during a frantic contest at Headingley Sinfield stayed on the bench throughout the first half but the introduction of forward Mitch Achurch helped perk up the Rhinos in the last 10 minutes and they pulled a try back in scintillating fashion when winger Kallum Watkins finished off a flowing move at the corner. The Leeds captain entered the action five minutes into the second half but his side were trailing 20-4 by then after a break by lively substitute Daryl Clark created the position for Ratchford to get Currie over for Warrington's fourth try. And there was no way back for Sinfield's men when Ormsby's neat offload enabled substitute prop Roy Asotasi to score his first try for more than 12 months. Leeds Rhinos veteran Kevin Sinfield made his 500th appearance for the club on Friday night Ratchford kicked his third goal to stretch his side's lead to 26-4 and increased it with a penalty on 63 minutes after Jamie Peacock was pulled up for a high tackle. The home side pulled a try back five minutes later through Achurch and Sinfield kicked the goal but it was little more than consolation and the Wolves had the final say when stand-off Declan Patton slotted a drop goal to open his account for the club on his third appearance.",

    "document": "Sister Gertrud Tiefenbacher (not pictured) was found in her bedroom, with a towel on her face An 86-year-old nun was reportedly gang-raped before being murdered in her bedroom at a South African missionary. Gertrud Tiefenbacher's hands had been tied with a typewriter cord and a towel placed over a face, say local police. Her body was found by other nuns at the Sacred Heart Missionary in Ixopo, a small town 85 miles south-west of Durban. Police in KwaZulu-Natal are waiting for the results of forensic tests to confirm that Sister Gertrud was sexually assaulted. They say she was suffocated but they are unsure how many men attacked her. A small sum of money - thought to be in euros - had been stolen from her room. The victim's friend Betty Firmstone, 85, told South Africa's Daily News: 'I met Sister in 1952 when I started teaching at a school attached to the mission. We worked very closely together. She loved her work with children. 'This really was an act of savagery against a gentle, caring soul.' Sister Gertrud had lived at the missionary for 60 years after moving to South Africa from her native Austria. Police spokesman Major Thulani Zwane said there were no signs of forced entry into the room - and the number of intruders was 'unclear'. 'It is alleged that the victim was at her residence when she was approached by a suspect who allegedly tied her hands with a typewriter cord,' he added. 'She was also covered with a towel over her face, causing the victim to suffocate. Rape is also suspected in this matter. 'We are following all leads. We are also appealing to the community to come forward with any information.' Nuns at the mission where the murdered sister lived have been serving the local community since 1923 The attack at the weekend is the first to be reported at the mission, which opened in 1923 for nuns wanting to serve the local community. It is also a home for young women who are considering becoming nuns. Sister Gerald, who lives at the mission, said Sister Gertrud had dedicated her life to helping impoverished children and adolescents. Despite her advanced age, she was working for the mission's educational outreach programme at the time of her murder. 'She had a very kind heart and was loved by everyone,' said Sister Gerald.",

    "document": "The 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to contest the Masters next week told Sportsmail of his immense relief that he held on to claim the last spot. Paul Casey was at home in Arizona when the matter was decided last Sunday and admitted he went through all sorts of agonies as his Augusta fate swung back and forth. The Englishman got in due to staying in the world’s top 50 but at one point, as events unfolded in Morocco and at the Texas Open, he was projected to fall to 54th. Paul Casey, pictured in action last month, is the 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to play at the Masters ‘I was very relieved and now I am just so excited,’ said Casey, who made the last of his eight Masters appearances in 2012. 'On the outside looking in is hardly where you want to be for the season’s first major. I’ve missed the whole experience.’ The classy ball striker has got all the tools to do well at Augusta and showed as much when he forced his way into contention on several occasions. The 37-year-old finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and actually led in 2007 after five holes of the final round. He then called a penalty shot on himself at the sixth after his ball moved a fraction when he addressed it with his putter. Casey finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and actually led in 2007 after five holes of the final round It’s a stupid rule that has subsequently been changed and Casey said, smiling:’It would be nice to wind the clock back, wouldn’t it? It did affect me for a few holes and I fell away (he finished 10th). But I’m going back a lot wiser and far better equipped if I got in contention again.’ Casey will wrap up his preparation at the Shell Houston Open, the site of his only PGA Tour victory. Also in the field are Justin Rose, Lee Westwood and a quartet of high class Americans in Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Rickie Fowler and Phil Mickelson. Meanwhile, there’s still no word on whether Tiger Woods will play the Masters, although he did at least declare his intent by pitching up for a practice round at Augusta on Tuesday.",

    "document": "The flag-burning father of a runaway British jihadi schoolgirl yesterday admitted taking his daughter to an extremist rally when she was 13. Abase Hussen – who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join IS earlier this year – conceded the teenager was ‘maybe’ influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun. Mr Hussen told MPs last month, after his daughter Amira Abase fled to Syria aged 15, that he could think of ‘nothing’ to explain why she and two friends had decided to join IS, as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism. Scroll down for video Abase Hussen, left, took his daughter Amira, right, to a demonstration when she was aged just 13 Abase Hussen, circled,  marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London in 2012 It then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob, screaming in rage at a protest outside the US embassy in London, in 2012. Also at the rally were hate cleric Anjem Choudary and Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He has now apologised for attending, but admitted going to two further rallies – with his impressionable daughter in tow. One took place outside the Saudi embassy in London, in 2013, and is said to have been organised by the Islamic extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, founded by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and linked to many Islamic terror atrocities of the past decade. Yesterday Mr Hussen, who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife Fetia, conceded they might have influenced the youngster, who would have been 13 at the time. ‘The only reason we took her first time, was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go,’ he said. The rally was held against the treatment of Ethiopians in Saudi Arabia after human rights violations, and Mr Hussen, 47, who is from Ethiopia, said: ‘We both lost many people back home, we wanted to try to get help for people back home, too many human rights violations there. Many died. Maybe it influenced her.’ Amira was one of three girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London who flew to Turkey before being smuggled across the border into Syria in February. Soon after, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to Syria. Asked by chairman Keith Vaz if Amira had been exposed to any extremism, Mr Hussen replied: ‘Not at all. Nothing.’ Yesterday respected analyst Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, tweeted: ‘Remember that Amira Abase’s father blamed the police for his daughter going to Syria and effectively misled Parliament with this nonsense.’ Mr Hussen told The Times yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag-burning rally. He said: ‘I went to show my feelings because my religion was being insulted, my faith. Protesting is not radical, it is our right.’ Amira Abase, pictured, was one of three girls who flew from Gatwick to Turkey before crossing to Syria Asked why he was pictured at the front of the mob, he said: ‘The crowd pushed me. I feel tricked. I did not know who they [the organisers] were. I just followed the crowd, I feel ashamed.’ Mr Hussen came to Britain from Germany in 1999 and said he came ‘for democracy, for the freedom, for a better life for children, so they could learn English’. He said he was upset with his daughter joining IS, saying she was ‘just a normal kid who is a victim of extremists’. Mr Hussen said he felt ‘terrible’ to know he had been protesting with one of Mr Rigby’s killers and said: ‘It was brutal, it has nothing to do with Islam, it is not human. You don’t do things like this.’ Amira fled to become a ‘jihadi bride’ with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16. A fourth girl from their school, Sharmeena Begum, left for Syria in December. Giving evidence to the MPs’ committee, Mr Hussen accused police of not doing enough to warn him and other parents. Last night Tory MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the committee, said: ‘I would certainly be in favour of Mr Hussen being recalled to give him a full opportunity to explain what he clearly did not when he appeared before us. ‘It’s shocking and outrageous anyone would think it appropriate to take their 13-year-old to such a rally. But then to tell a House of Commons committee you have no idea why a young teenager should seek to travel to Syria, when you have taken her to more than one of these events, is simply breathtaking.’",

Doaa and Umm, whose names have been changed to conceal their identities, were smuggled from Raqqa, in Syria, to southern Turkey after leaving the al-Khansa Brigade earlier this year. The pair said they used to be heavily involved in punishing others who did not obey the group's rules - including giving 60 lashes to those who tried to flee. Scroll down for video Doaa and Umm (above), whose names have been changed to conceal their identities have revealed what life was like working for the brutal al-Khansa Brigade In an interview with Sky News Doaa, who left after her Saudi Arabian husband blew himself up in a suicide attack, said women also received a 'standard' 40 lashes if they did not wear proper Islamic dress. The 20-year-old, who was paid around £70 a month by the unit, said: 'What upset me most was lashing old women when they weren't wearing the proper clothes.' Umma, 25, was forced to marry a foreign fighter. She said did not see him very much as he was often on the front line. 'Most of the time I would stay at my parents’ house because he wasn't around. He behaved normally, he would come home for two or three days and then go back to fight,' she said, adding that she did not love him. Now the pair, who are living in Turkey illegally, are scared they will be discovered by ISIS fighters who, they believe, are following them. The al-Khansa Brigade operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa. The women revealed they used to be heavily involved in punishing others who did not obey the group's rules - including those who tried to escape.

Above, other women from the brigade are pictured holding guns It achieved notoriety last year after women who travelled to join the Islamic State's insurgency boasted of joining the police unit. They used social media to brag about doling out savage beatings and lashings, ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of sex slaves are believed to be imprisoned and raped daily. In the brigade's first manifesto, released in February, women are told to live a completely 'sedentary' lifestyle. It adds that their role should be primarily to remain 'hidden and veiled' and at the service of men, who are described as their masters. While it claims not to have been written or approved by ISIS's leadership, it provides a disturbing look at the way women are treated. Last September a Syrian woman agreed to carry a hidden camera to film daily life in Raqqa. Her footage showed several gun-wielding French women who had left their home country to join ISIS (above) The women’s revelations come a day after a shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya was released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the east of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', were lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others were filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. It followed another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film.",

It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week.

WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities.

'The city suffers from a shortage of electricity where the power goes off for 21 hours in the day,' he wrote in another tweet. ISIS prides itself on its well-oiled propaganda offensive, pumping out images, videos and even a weekly English-language magazine designed to recruit and radicalise would-be jihadists. Co-ordinated by its AlHayat Media Centre, the terror group makes extensive use of social media to keep in near-constant contact with supporters in the West - even selling branded merchandise such as T-shirts, baseball caps and cuddly toys. But as seen here, that ease of disseminating information can easily backfire. Most of the Syrians in this line appear to be woman and children. The pictures were posted on Twitter by the anti-ISIS group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently who risk their lives leaking information from the city The food queue pictures emerged days after ISIS took their draconian rule to bizarre new levels by threatening to jail any man caught wearing skinny jeans in an apparent crackdown on hipsters. The terror group said it would also imprison anyone caught with music on their mobiles, smoking or turning up late for prayer in the city. Violators will be jailed for ten days, during which time they will be made to take an 'Islamic course'. At the end of their prison term, they will be forced to take a test, with those who pass being released immediately. Those who don't will be fined and kept in prison until they do. Other sickening sentences involve people being stoned to death for alleged adultery and thrown off buildings after being accused of being homosexual. Bleak picture: Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi one of the group's founders, wrote the accompanying message: 'Lines waiting for some food. Yes this is the #ISIS State. Hunger, poverty and homelessness' One resident, named only as Jassem, told the group how dozens of people had fled the city in the wake of the jihadi network's brutal enforcement of its twisted form of sharia law. He said: 'ISIS tightens penalties and uses the principle of intimidation in dealing with public, which led to the migration and escape of many people.  Freedom of expression has become a crime.' In a separate development, ISIS has announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates.",

    "document": "Blackburn should brace themselves for interest in their players from top-flight clubs following their run to the FA Cup quarter-finals, manager Gary Bowyer has said. Sky Bet Championship side Rovers were eliminated from the competition on Wednesday night by Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool, who booked a semi-final date at Wembley at the second time of asking thanks to Philippe Coutinho's angled 70th-minute finish in an Ewood Park replay. It ended a memorable FA Cup journey for Rovers that had included resounding home victories over Barclays Premier League sides Swansea and Stoke in previous rounds. Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer believes the club should brace themselves for interest in their players The manner in which they dispatched those two, coupled with the fact they frustrated Liverpool for the majority of the 180 minutes, is unlikely to have gone unnoticed by bigger clubs plotting their summer spending. Bowyer is no stranger to staving off interest in his prized assets, having rejected advances for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede in the past two transfer windows, and the Rovers boss expects overtures for more of his men in a few months' time. 'What the players have done is they've put themselves on a platform and shown that they can play in the Premier League,' he said. 'They've got to maintain that over the next six games and show the Premier League big boys. That's obviously the nature of the game that we're in, I'm not going to kid myself. 'It's the nature of business. If you look at all the clubs now, everybody sells. Liverpool sold (Luis) Suarez in the summer. 'You've seen over the two games against Liverpool and in previous games against Swansea and Stoke that we've got some very good young players. They're developing, they're growing and getting some real experience under their belts.' Blackburn strikers Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede have both attrackted in the last two transfer windows Blackburn's owners Venky's have previously adopted a strong stance on possible outgoings, telling Hull and Crystal Palace that Rhodes and Gestede would be remaining in east Lancashire. However, that position may have to soften if Rovers are to bring their mounting debts down as they look to adhere to the Financial Fair Play regulations. Their recent failure to do so caused the Football League to place them under a transfer embargo which Bowyer knows has left him restricted when injuries have hit. 'You always want to keep your players and we want to be in a position to add to it,' he added. 'We've got to try and do as much as we can with this embargo. The embargo's just caught up with us because we haven't been able to bring enough bodies in.' Bowyer shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers ahead of Wednesday's FA Cup replay Indeed, Bowyer's options are so stretched at the minute that he joked he is considering starting goalkeeper Simon Eastwood in attack against Reading this Saturday. The stopper almost produced a moment for the FA Cup annals on Wednesday when, after coming up for a Tommy Spurr long throw, his swivel and shot deep into stoppage time almost beat Simon Mignolet in the Liverpool goal. 'We sent Easty up, more in hope than anything, we didn't know he had that football ability in him to turn and hit it on the spin,' Bowyer admitted. 'He's put himself forward for centre forward on Saturday!' Goalkeeper Simon Eastwood almost scored a late equaliser beyond Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet",

    "document": "Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme The controller of BBC Radio 3 has branded audiences ignorant and claims broadcasting classical music has become more challenging as a result. Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme. Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years. He said: 'If you look back at the Third Programme (the original name for Radio 3), they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything. 'They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them. 'The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago – not consistently so, anyway. 'We have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works. 'It's not lowering the standard, it's not making the content simple. It's about how we present it.' Mr Davey, who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England, added: 'I believe there are different ways to draw people into music. 'There's the Classic FM way, and they're very good at that. 'We'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers, and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout.' The station has been accused of 'dumbing down' in the past, especially after a drive in 2011 to make it more 'accessible' to a broader audience. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright (above) dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down With just two million listeners, Radio 3 is the least listened-to of the BBC's main stations. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down and said there were distinct differences between the stations. He said: 'I just don't recognise it at all. Apparently we do phone-ins? We don't. 'We haven't had a request show for a long, long time. You do hear one listener voice on the breakfast show suggesting a piece of music — that's not exactly a phone-in. So it's complete nonsense.'",

    "document": "Tom Ballard plans to climb K2, 20 years after his mother died descending from its peak A climber has set his sights on the summit of K2 - the second highest mountain in the world - 20 years after his mother died attempting the same feat. Alison Hargreaves, 32, was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalayan mountain in 1995. Now her son Tom Ballard, one of the world's most accomplished climbers, plans to conquer K2 himself. Mr Ballard, 26, told The Times that he saw it as his destiny to follow in his mother's footsteps. He said: 'I think it must be. At one stage I thought I would go and climb mountains for her. Then I realised that was actually a bit stupid because she had already climbed them herself. I realised I was climbing for myself. That's how I've gone on.' Last month Mr Ballard became the first to solo climb all six of the great north faces of the Alps in the winter season - and now he is training for K2. The climber was just six years old when his mother died while descending K2, which is regarded as more difficult to reach than the summit of Mount Everest, with dozens dying during attempts to reach the top. Days before her death, Mrs Hargreaves sent a fax to her son and his sister Katie. It read: 'Tom and Katie, We have arrived at our base camp. The trek was difficult — it snowed every day. The mountain I have come to climb is called K2.' Attached was a drawing of the 28,251ft mountain which would later claim her life. Mr Ballard's mother was a revered figure in the climbing world and was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen. Alison Hargreaves (pictured with Tom and his sister Katie as children) was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalalayn mountain in 1995 K2 is regarded as more difficult to reach than the summit of Mount Everest, with dozens dying during attempts to reach the top Mrs Hargreaves, pictured with her husband Jim and thier family, was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen Tragic: Mr Ballard was just six years old when his mother died on her way down from the summit of K2 Her decision to take on dangerous climbs while raising a young family was criticised by some, but she shrugged off the flak, saying that fathers who went climbing did not face the same scrutiny. When she climbed the north face of the Eiger, in the Swiss Alps, in 1988, Mrs Hargreaves was pregnant with her son. Mr Ballard said he had clear memories of clambering over rocks as a child and had always known climbing was his calling. 'When I grew, I was always scrambling around on little rocks underneath the crags where my mum and dad climbed. A child, playing,' he said. 'At primary school I had something like an epiphany. Suddenly I decided that all I wanted to do with my life was just to climb. Since then that's pretty much all I have done.'",

    "document": "A meat trader who swindled cash through a mortgage fraud scam to pay for luxury holidays was ordered to pay back £500,000 today. Grant Allen, 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled first class around the world with his girlfriend Gaynor Godwin and bought a holiday home on the Costa Del Sol, Spain, using criminally gained money. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing £30,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth £7,600. Grant Allen (left), 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled round the world with his girlfriend, Gaynor Godwin (right) using money from a mortgage fraud scam. Edward Byatt (behind Allen, left) was also involved in the fraud Allen also splurged £8,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World. The Old Bailey heard that he hid the fraud by buying and trading properties and funnelling large amounts of cash through his unwitting girlfriend's bank account. The couple lived in a £700,000 home in Rayne, Essex - where £33,000 was spent on landscaping the garden - and also owned a property in Hertfordshire, bought with the proceeds of the fraud. When the home in Essex was raided in 2011, detectives found large piles of cash including £1,000 which was stashed in the extractor fan in the kitchen. Judge Stephen Kramer QC today ordered Allen to pay back £491,000 as the proceeds of crime. Allen, who was jailed for six years for mortgage fraud and money laundering, could face another three years behind bars if he fails to pay the money back. Allen splurged £8,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World However, the court heard he has assets including homes in Essex, Bishop Stortford, and southern Spain which he can sell to cover the repayment. A second defendant, Edward Byatt, 39, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, was ordered to pay back £10,000 for his part in the fraud. His name was on the deeds for the home in Rayne, despite Allen living there with Ms Godwin and their young son. ‘Grant Allen used other people in the laundering process. He is somehow involved in criminal behaviour,’ prosecutor Charles Evans told the trial in 2013. ‘The money would have been criminal proceeds.’ During his trial, Allen claimed he worked as a meat trader and a builder, and suggested his funds had come from successful gambling ventures. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing £30,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth £7,600 Mr Evans told the jury: ‘Grant Allen and Gaynor Godwin lived an enviable lifestyle and travelled to Dubai and America, sometimes travelling first class and staying in luxury hotels.’ Godwin was cleared by the jury of conspiracy to remove criminal property after telling them she had no idea where Allen had got the large sums of money. But Allen and Byatt were both convicted after trial and were both in court to hear the order being made. The judge will consider on Thursday whether to impose on Allen a strict financial reporting order which would force him to present the authorities with regular documents showing his use of money.",

    "document": "Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'",

The time lapse footage speeds along the 9km long electrified track, which leads from Kleine Scheidegg to Jungraujoch and stands at an elevation of 2061m and 3454m respectively. Opening in a tunnel built into a Swiss mountain, the train careers towards the light and out onto the snowy slopes to race alongside the many skiers. Turning a corner, the train moves at a slow and steady pace – the track barely visible from under the snow. Two people quickly cross the track in front of the train as it begins picking up speed and passes alongside a ledge that looks down on chalets below. The video then shows the train beginning its descent of the mountain, passing very close to a number of skiers who make their own way to the bottom of the slope. The video opens inside a tunnel build into the Swiss mountain as the train makes its way along the 9km long electrified track Turning right the train enters another tunnel and plunges back into darkness before re-emerging next to even more skiers. Suddenly the train begins travelling even faster as the banks of snow rise up higher alongside it. Like a bobsleigh the train hurtles down the track as the settlement at the bottom of the mountain slowly comes into view.

    "document": "Famed for phenomenal cuisine, majestic rural landscapes and vibrant cities, Vietnam offers an undisputed sensory overload. But there's one sight the becomes most engrained in the memories of even the most seasoned traveller - the wacky things people carry on the back of a motorbike or scooter. Lee Thompson's seen plenty in his 14 years as an award-winning photojournalist covering the civil war in Libya, the revolution in Egypt, the tsunami in Japan and other extensive travels before he co-founded The Flash Pack, a small group flashpacking tour company. But even he repeatedly marvels at what the men and women of southeast Asia can balance and transport on just a scooter or a beaten up old motorcycle, and on one of his company's Vietnam & Cambodia tours with a group of nine this month he was compelled to capture some of the finest. There's seemingly no measure to what can be packed onto the back of a bike or scooter in southeast Asia The Flash Pack's Lee Thompson captured this man with scores of live chickens in weaved baskets this month in Sapa, Vietnam That's one way to pop a wheelie! A man pulls a packed trailer from a loading dock at the Mekong river crossing in Vietnam with a motorbike In this series of images from a single 14-day trip, he photographs a man casually puffing on a cigarette and carrying what looks like more than 20 live chickens in woven cages perched on the back of his scooter in Sapa, Vietnam. At a Mekong river crossing in Vietnam he is there to watch a motorcyclist dragging a massive trailer out of a boat loading dock on a bike, with the load so heavy he continuously pops wheelies, all the while not in the slightest bit bothered his two wheels have become one. Thompson enjoys the fact that what looks quirky to a Brit is simply every day life for the locals. In Vietnam alone there are more than 37 million motorbikes or scooters, most definitely the vehicle of choice in traffic that would make western country's peak hours look tame. 'Unlike other tour companies we venture in to remote parts of Sapa where it's not unusual to see bikes carrying livestock like chickens, pigs and goats - it makes really great photographs but it's just a way of life for the locals,' said Thompson. In Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, all that's needed to move some large piles of chairs is two wheels and some clever  packing Getting around on two wheels is a way of life in Vietnam where there are more than 37 million motorbikes (and only a few million cars) 'I watched as one of the bikers tried to work out how he would carry eight goats on his bike, he fell three times before he finally got going and the goats didn't seem to happy about it!' A family of five and a smiling group of four adults pile onto scooters to get from A to B while another transport a giant pile of chairs stacked on a tray from one side of the city to the other with the power of just his humble two-wheeler. With limited resources comes innovation, as is evident with one mother who has attached a cane high chair to the front of her vehicle to make it more comfortable for her to transport her toddler around town in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 'Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh are full of bikes and it makes the morning commute in London seem easy,' Thompson said. 'Even though most of our group was very well travelled the amount of bikes on the road still comes as a shock in these amazing countries - it's crazy!' A mother fits a high chair is onto the front of a scooter for her toddler in this shot captured in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam A bike that's seen better days carrying pigs is not an unusual sight on the road to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, says Thompson A family drive is a cosy affair for this five-some packed onto a scooter  in Hanoi The man on the back of this scooter in Hanoi, Vietnam, holds a ladder and some building materials as they weave their way through traffic Thompson says the eight goats in the cage on the back on this bike 'didn't seem happy' as the rider tipped them over three times The commute in Vietnam makes the daily battle on the Tube that Londoners endure look easy, but they don't seem to mind The morning commute in Ho Chi Minh City is certainly less stuffy than piling into the Tube on a Monday morning And here are some more unique uses for scooters... An assortment of exotic fish are in bags and ready for sale, cleverly attached to this man's scooter, in Hạ Long Bay, Vietnam A basket vendor balances an array of products on the back of this small motorised bike in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam There's only one way to transport a bike that isn't working in Vietnam ... on the back of one of the country's 37 million bikes or scooters",

    "document": "Jason Cotterill, 42, sent explicit revenge porn images of his ex partner to her children and set up 67 Facebook profiles to bombard her with abuse A jilted lover who sent explicit revenge porn images of his ex-partner to her daughter and set up 67 Facebook profiles to bombard her with abuse has been jailed. Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with abusive messages over the internet after she tried to end their relationship in October last year. A court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on to her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant, saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she 'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. She said: 'He started setting up different profiles on Facebook to send me messages. He also sent my family messages and my friends messages because he couldn't get to me. 'I was very upset, it drove me insane, it made me depressed. I'm on medication. 'His language was absolutely disgusting. He was asking me why I wasn't playing any more, calling me names.' The victim said Cotterill found pictures of her on the internet that he threatened to send to her family and friends. He sent more than one to her daughter, she said. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes In October last year, Cotterill sent the victim a link to an x-rated explicit video with a message that said: 'F**k it, I'm going to have it as my profile picture'. He also taunted the victim on Facebook, telling her: 'I am going to send some more pictures too because it's fun lol.' The 42-year-old was 'driven insane' and suffered depression and panic attacks after Cotterill spent a year sending 'disgusting' messages. David Houldcroft, defending, said Cotterill, who had two previous convictions for harassment, accepted sending the link and that it would have caused her upset. Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim 'He regrets that and understands that he has problems with relationships,' Mr Houldcroft said. 'He suffers from depression and has alcohol issues. He recognises that he needs help.' Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim. District Judge David Robinson said: 'You harassed the complainant over a three-month period and used social networks constantly in a threatening manner to get her to re-engage with you. 'There are a number of aggravating features in this case. 'You sought to use dozens of Facebook profiles to get in touch with her, you also found a link to a pornographic site and made use of that. 'You either involved or threatened to involve others, sending the link to the woman's friends and her sister, insinuating that her children might get to see the photos. 'You used the power you had over her by the knowledge of those photos.'",

    "document": "Lewis Hamilton has conceded to feeling more powerful now than at any stage in his F1 career. It is an ominous warning from a man who has won nine of the last 11 grands prix, been on pole at the last four, and who already holds a 27-point cushion in the drivers' standings. It is no wonder after winning in Bahrain, when Hamilton stepped out of his Mercedes, he immediately stood on top of it and pretended to smack an imaginary baseball out of the circuit. Lewis Hamilton stands on his Mercedes after winning the Bahrain Grand Prix It was another 'home run' performance from Hamilton, a man who claims he is a perfectionist, and who appears to be driving as close to perfection as can possibly be achieved in the sport. It led to the suggestion that perhaps he was feeling unbeatable, to which he replied: 'I don't know what the feeling of being unbeatable is. 'I know I feel very powerful in this car with the package we have, and I feel I'm able to get everything from it. 'I also feel more comfortable in this car than I did in the one last year, and I feel within myself, with whatever approach I have, the power is greater than ever in terms of strength in the car. 'It's like 'yes'. I put the car there and it goes there, I get the exit. 'Naturally you always feel there are things you can still improve on, but it's hard to always pinpoint what those are and to tell the team what to focus on. Hamilton is congratulated by Ferrari rival Kimi Raikkonen on Sunday 'That's what a team leader has to do, and, along with Nico (Rosberg), I'm trying to guide the team, to tell them where to go next.' So just how close to perfection does Hamilton feel? 'There are always areas. I'll look and think 'Could I have braked later for the pit entry? Could I have done a better outlap?' said the 30-year-old. 'I feel I'm doing the best I can, and I'm learning and improving at the same time, which is all I can ask for.' Yet do not dare to suggest to Hamilton that he does not work as hard off the track in terms of poring over every aspect of what is required to ensure he is at one with his car. In being compared with former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button in the past, or Rosberg at present, the feeling has generally been they are more studious than Hamilton, who simply just drives. 'Of course I analyse. You can't be a world champion without doing that,' Hamilton said. 'I remember speaking about this a long time ago and I don't know if people get a perception as to who you are as a driver, but I work as hard as any other driver. 'Just because I do things differently it doesn't mean I'm worse. Race winner Hamilton celebrates with the trophy on the podium in Bahrain 'There was a point where people said Nico was a doctor of this or that; Jenson was a doctor of his tyres. 'I tick off all the boxes, and I've worked to do that. 'The results I get are not only from my raw ability because I study hard, I work hard to make notes about my tyres, about every single thing I do, which I've done since my days in Formula Three. 'Ultimately, I don't care what people think. I just do the job.' Hamilton certainly has Rosberg scratching his head as the German appears to have run out of ideas as to how to beat his main rival. Hamilton has now set a personal record run of 11 consecutive grands prix in the points - twice finishing second in addition to the nine wins. If you include the double points for the final race of last season, Hamilton has scored an astonishing 286 from a potential 300. It is not perfection, so perhaps there is a feeling of never being quite satisfied. 'That's natural for anyone who has the competitiveness I have,' said Hamilton. 'I know the potential I have, and whether or not I'm living up to it. 'I feel I am coming close to full potential - although who knows exactly what that is - but I do feel quite satisfied.' Which is why he also feels he still has more to give, starting with the next grand prix in three weeks' time in Spain. 'I got the pole, I did the job (in Bahrain),' Hamilton said. 'Now I have to see if I can improve, and I want to improve when I get to Barcelona.'",

    "document": "(CNN)Sofia Vergara's ex-fiance is speaking out about their dispute over frozen embryos created while they dated. In an op-ed published by The New York Times on Wednesday,  Nick Loeb explained his rationale for fighting to keep the two female embryos he shares with the actress. \"I wanted to keep this private, but recently the story broke to the world,\" Loeb wrote. \"It has gotten attention not only because of the people involved -- my ex is Sofia Vergara, who stars in the ABC series \"Modern Family\" -- but also because embryonic custody disputes raise important questions about life, religion and parenthood.\" Loeb says he met the actress in 2010 and they got engaged two years later, at which point they decided to create the embryos and conceive a child via a surrogate. After two attempts failed to bring fertilized embryos to term, they created two more embryos using her eggs and his sperm. \"When we create embryos for the purpose of life, should we not define them as life, rather than as property?,\" he said. \"... A woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects. Shouldn't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects?\" Loeb said he filed a complaint against the 42-year-old actress to prevent her from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. He filed it in August in Santa Monica, California, where they apparently lived while they dated. \"We signed a form stating that any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties' consent. The form did not specify -- as California law requires -- what would happen if we separated,\" he said. \" I am asking to have it voided.\" Representatives for Vergara have declined to comment in the past. Loeb has said he believes \"life begins at fertilization\" and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term. He said he doesn't want any money from the egg donor. The case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos. Typically, a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority, said fertility specialist Dr. David Tourgeman, who's not involved in this case. \"Usually when embryos are created, whether the couple is married or just consenting adults, there's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos, if they are frozen for future use,\" he said. In most cases, the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney, although anyone can make a request, Tourgeman said. If there's a disagreement, the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos, he said. Vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor Joe Manganiello.",

Nancy Perry will no longer teach students at Dublin Middle School and will retire at the end of the year, city schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter announced on Tuesday. Perry is alleged to have told students that Obama is a Muslim and that any parent who support him couldn't be Christian, either. Nancy Perry, left, won't teach again at Dublin Middle School in Georgia after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and parent Jimmie Scott complained A 12-year-old boy in Perry's class brought the matter to the attention of his father, Jimmie Scott, who complained to the school. 'If your parents voted for Obama, they're evil and I don't see how your parents could vote for someone that's Muslim' he told WMAZ, paraphrasing Perry's alleged comments. Scott said he immediately requested a parent-teacher conference to which Perry brought along her husband Bill, who sits on the county Board of Education. Instead of discussing Nancy Perry's classroom comments, Scott says that she and her husband showed him what he described as internet propaganda. 'She showed it to me and said, \"See, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old as they're coming through the birth canal.\"' Superintendent Ledbetter said Perry was already planning on retiring before the complaint about her behavior. 'On behalf of the School District, we want to apologize to the student and to his parents,' he said at a school board meeting. Scott said he requested a parent-teacher conference, but Nancy Perry brought along her husband Bill, pictured above, who sites on the Board of Education.  The pair showed him what he described as anti-Obama internet propaganda City schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter says school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on parent-teacher meetings 'It is not the place of teachers to attempt to persuade students about religious or political beliefs.' Scott also addressed the community at the meeting, saying his family had been ridiculed and had racial slurs thrown at them. Scott is black and Perry is white. 'We've lost loved ones in the community because a line was drawn,' Scott said. 'Either you were for my son or you were for the teacher.' Ledbetter also apologized for the actions of Perry's husband, who he said shouldn't have attended the parent-teacher conference.

    "document": "Arsenal are the form team in Europe at present, winning 10 games out of their last 11, including seven in a row. Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture. Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina selected a rap song from his home country - J Balvin's 'Tranquila' Theo Walcott opted for a 1996 summer jam - LL Cool J's laid back R&B song 'Loungin''",

    "document": "New Delhi, India (CNN)As the earth shook in Nepal, tremors were felt over the border in India as well. It was a call to action: Within hours of the first 7.8 magnitude quake, India began planning a massive cross-border aid mission. With each hour, the scale of the devastation in Nepal became clearer -- some 3,862 people are known to have died so far -- and plans in India, where 72 people were also killed, got bigger. On Sunday alone, India delivered 187 tons of supplies, including 50 tons of water, 22 tons of food and 2 tons of medicine. And there will be more to come. Hundreds of trained disaster relief troops landed in Kathmandu and quickly got to work. With each flight in, there was a flight back out, packed with Indians and other nationals escaping to safety: 2,000 and counting have fled so far. By Monday, India was in full-scale crisis mode: From airports across India, planes flew in loaded with aid, and trucks made the trip by land from India's east, aiming for more remote areas. On the ground: Devastation in Nepal India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a special effort over Nepal. He has visited the country twice in his first year in office. And on Sunday, in his national radio address to the nation, he said Indians needed to \"wipe the tears of every Nepali, hold their hands, and stand with them.\" It all highlights the more proactive role taken by India in recent months. Just weeks ago, India flexed its military muscle to rescue Indians and other nationals from conflict-torn Yemen. Now, it is taking the lead in Nepal. Some might say India's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with Nepal: China. A display of hard power, perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region. But in times like this, help is always welcome. First there's the immediate search and rescue operation, and then the long process of rebuilding work. Nepal will need India's friendship -- as well as China's -- for many long months ahead.",

At the end of last month, the young royal, who lives three and a half thousand miles away from her family in the UK, celebrated her 25th birthday. In the middle of a Palace function, her father, Prince Andrew, whipped out his iPad and used it to video call his daughter, who currently lives in Manhattan. The shop stocks trendy brands including Stella McCartney, Proenza Schouler, Missoni, J Brand and Chloe If that wasn’t enough, the prince got his 400-strong audience in the State Apartments at St James’s Palace to sing a cheery rendition of Happy Birthday, accompanied by a trumpeter from the Scots Guards. The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James’s Palace, saying: ‘We are going to do something new this evening. ‘The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it’s her 25th birthday today.’ Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved. Andrew told her: ‘You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).’ He then turned to the lance corporal and added: ‘If you will lead us in Happy Birthday please...’ There were cheers from the crowd as the song came to an end, while plenty of others waved and tried to capture the moment on their camera phones. Eugenie looked delighted and said she was ‘very proud, Pops’ of her father’s role in the awards, which celebrate innovation and technology in the creative industries. But the singalong did not impress his ex-wife, who joked - in the style of a Eurovision announcement - that the rendition scored ‘zero points’. The Duke of York holds an iPad as he invites the audience at the Pitch@Palace event to sing happy birthday via FaceTime to his daughter Princess Eugenie Sarah added: ‘We think you all need to go for choir practice.’ Andrew, however, was content with the gesture. ‘Having been told this was a bad idea, it worked,’ he said. The Prince, who used a Pitch@Palace event last year to send the first royal selfie, joked: ‘’What was it somebody said about children and dogs?’ The social media-savy Royal is also the only senior working royal to have his own personal Twitter account.

Scroll down for video CLAIM: MP Jesse Norman is being investigated by police over claims he attempted to 'bribe' voters with chocolate cake, pictured above Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2.

The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates. Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season. 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. . And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations.  . 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. . Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres. Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time. But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again. 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. . But after his brilliant goal at the Emirates stadium last weekend, one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres.  .",

Southampton full-back Nathaniel Clyne (left) tussles for possession with Stoke's Steven Nzonzi (right) Stoke forward Jonathan Walters dribbles ahead of Southampton's Maya Yoshida (right) in their last game. Koeman had to cope with several player sales at Southampton, including Luke Shaw to Manchester United . Attacking midfielder Adam Lallana (right) was also sold to Liverpool shortly after Koeman arrived at the club. With five matches remaining, Saints are just a point and a place worse off than Spurs in sixth and can usurp them in the European spots with victory in Saturday's early kick-off. 'Everybody was afraid because we had to make a lot of changes in the team,' Koeman told reporters. 'But I think the quality of the players that we brought in were good, at a good level. I think the rest of the players had really a good aspiration and ambition to do a good season, to play a good season at a good level. 'Now we are fighting for a high position in the table. There's still five games to play and a very nice one this Saturday afternoon. 'It is Tottenham, the difference is only one point and, okay, for the fans maybe it makes it a little bit more special because Mauricio is now the coach and was the coach of Southampton. 'He is the coach of the opponent this Saturday, so that makes it special but the game will be decided between the white lines.' Koeman was speaking at St Mary's after meeting Barclays Spirit of the Game hero Tina Croucher, who was being rewarded for her community work at the club. The Southampton manager and midfielder Victor Wanyama answered questions from a handful of supporters as part of the event, where talk of Pochettino was rarely far away. Koeman says his return along with the potential implications of the result makes Saturday's match the biggest at St Mary's since he took the reins. A positive result would see Saints break their record Premier League points haul set last year by Pochettino, although he is unlikely to get a particularly warm reception. The former Argentina defender's departure left a sour taste with many Southampton fans, whose travelling support gave him a taster of what to expect at White Hart Lane earlier in the season. 'Sometimes if you go as a Barcelona player to Madrid the reception is difficult, and sometimes in Holland,' Koeman said, when asked if he has such a bad reception. 'But, okay, I think the reception for Mauricio normally has to be good because he did a great job for Southampton. 'I like him as a person and as a coach and we have a good contact.' Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama (centre) shields the ball from Swansea players back in September. There certainly does not appear any bad blood between Koeman and Pochettino, despite the latter suggesting earlier in the year that he handed the Dutchman an easy job at Southampton. Koeman took those comments in his stride, joking at the time that he only came to Southampton 'to have a nice little holiday'. Now, just days before the game, the Saints boss gave a more serious answer, praising his Spurs counterpart for the legacy he left at St Mary's. 'I think they make the beginning (of this) and developed the quality of the players, the young players,' Koeman said. 'I think the structure and organisation in the team, the spirit of the players starts under Mauricio. 'I took that over and maybe we were different in some details. From what I heard, maybe I try to do more training sessions with the ball and maybe he was a little bit more physical. 'I think the start, for the development of the team, was under Mauricio and he did a great job last season. 'We continue (that) and so far we made it a little bit better than it was, but that is all about the experience and quality of the players.' .

    "document": "Former QPR manager Harry Redknapp feels he still has plenty to offer football but only at the right club, having turned down a 'mind-blowing' offer to coach abroad. The 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'. Redknapp will return to the dugout on Sunday, May 31 when he leads a star-studded Men United XI against Leyton Orient Legends, as O's youth coach and Prostate Cancer UK ambassador Errol McKellar hosts a charity football match at The Matchroom Stadium. Harry Redknapp (right) says he would consider a return to management as long as it's at the right club. Redknapp was speaking at the announcement of a Men United XI vs Leyton Orient Legends charity match. The well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances. 'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me. 'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do. Redknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February. Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago. The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time. 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches. He said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level. . Redknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club. The Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining. 'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.' Redknapp lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer and is backing the Men United campaign to help raise awareness of the disease, which is the most common cancer in men with more than 10,000 deaths each year. He said: 'Prostate Cancer is something which can affect any family at any time so it is important that people come out to support this cause. 'We are all scared that if the doctor tells you that you have something wrong, but if you get there early enough it can be cured - you can't let it just go.'

    "document": "Tuesday, April 14, is Equal Pay Day. Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make:. \"Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn.  And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.  And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too.\" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty.  And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. \"Everyday Americans need a champion,\" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, \"and I want to be that champion.\" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day. With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy.  And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap. Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work?  Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.  They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates. Policy (I hope) still matters, but we're as likely to debate a candidate's \"image\" as her or his \"substance.\" The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics, as they are in our culture in general. That doesn't mean they can't also serve a noble purpose, in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. Clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch, framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the American people. In fact, Clinton didn't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle-class Americans, working hard, trying to get by and get ahead. And then we see Hillary, who wants to help. Hillary Clinton can't change who she is, the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left, rightly or wrongly. But she can change what she does going forward, how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary Americans who need change. If Clinton wins, her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic. And it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in America.",

Taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point.

Clint Hill scored his first Barclays Premier League goal for Rangers' second, and Fernandes was delighted with the display of the veteran centre back, even if he did fail to get to grips with the prolific Benteke. He also reserved praise for manager Chris Ramsey. 'Clint hill typified our fighting spirit,' he posted. 'As I've always said players playing for the badge and Chris Ramsey what a pro.' Finally, Fernandes posted some cryptic tweets as to his own future at the club, perhaps hinting that he would be leaving. Hill had equalised in the second half after hosts Villa led 2-1 at the break courtesy of Benteke's two goals. Matt Phillips opened the scoring for Rangers but they found themselves pegged back by brilliant Benteke. Fernandes is also Global CEO of AirAsia, the airline that saw flight QZ8501 go missing late last year. 'It's been a tough three months since December 28th. Abuse, tragedy, close friends gone but I never stopped believing in all that we do,' Fernandes said. 'The decision on my future has been made. 6 games 18 points. Never stop believing rangers fans.

Gerrard will leave Anfield at the end of the season to join Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy and the skipper is hoping to bow out in style by leading Brendan Rodgers' side to the final at Wembley. But ahead of Wednesday night's quarter-final replay with Blackburn, Fowler has warned Gerrard's team-mates not to concentrate on providing the 34-year-old with a fairytale ending to his Liverpool career. . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (right) trains alongside Rickie Lambert at Melwood on Monday. Gerrard will miss Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final replay with Blackburn because of suspension. Reds legend Robbie Fowler, pictured with Kenny Dalglish, says Liverpool's players must not focus on Gerrard. Fowler told goal.com: 'Everyone would absolutely love Steven to win it, what with this being his last season and possibly last game, and hopefully that will be the case. 'But Liverpool have got to get themselves into the position where they can't do this just for Steven Gerrard. They've got to do it for every individual involved with the club. That's the way it should be.' Gerrard will miss the trip to Ewood Park as he serves the second match of a three-game suspension and Fowler hopes that Jordan Henderson and Co put their missing captain to the back of their minds. 'If you put too much effort in for one man, maybe you can get a little bit too excited or overboard,' added Fowler. 'As much as it would be Steven's last game, they've got to get past that and just do it for themselves. 'In an ideal world, they'll do it, and no-one would love it more than me. Steven deserves to go out on a high but they've got to do it for themselves. It's not all about Steven.' Fowler has also urged Raheem Sterling to end his contract wrangle and commit his future to the club after he rejected a new deal worth £100,000-a-week. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling has rejected a new £100,000-a-week deal to stay at Anfield. Fowler believes Sterling, pictured training on Monday, should stay at Liverpool to develop his game. Writing in his column for the Daily Mirror, Fowler said: 'I think it’s nonsense to suggest Sterling will have to go elsewhere to win trophies and fulfil all these dreams he’s apparently got. 'In the space of two seasons, with a very, very young team that will only get better, they should have won the league, should have beaten Chelsea in a semi to get to Wembley... and should play in an FA Cup Final there in May. 'I was brought up at Anfield and still work there, so what else am I going to think?, but he’d be crazy to go at this stage in his development, especially because he’s being guided by a special manager who has already turned Luis Suarez into one of the best players in the world... and earned Luis the money to go with that status.'  .",

    "document": "Tim Sherwood's jacket did not survive beyond the first 10 minutes and after this astonishing contest it remains to be seen if either of these sides fare much better. When Aston Villa's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of Christian Benteke's first half equaliser, he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the Barclays Premier League after all. Indeed when he then saw Benteke convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes, he may have felt his damning critique on Monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for. But the grit, desire and determination his forwards had demonstrated was lacking at the opposite end of the field and a QPR side every bit as desperate to maintain their top flight status did a fine job of exposing exactly the weaknesses Sherwood had highlighted. Matt Phillips (left) headed Queens Park Rangers into a seventh-minute lead, getting on the end of Bobby Zamora's cross. Winger Phillips garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond Brad Guzan in the Aston Villa goal . Joey Barton wheels away after watching Phillips nod in at the back post, as Ciaran Clark (left) and Carlos Sanchez appeal for offside . But QPR were only ahead for three minutes after Christian Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh Premier League goal of the season. If it made for a hugely entertaining encounter, it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be. Sherwood walked off the pitch at half-time with his hands planted casually in his pockets, comforted by the fact that his side were sitting five points clear of relegation danger. But when Charlie Austin followed Chint Hill's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors, Villa had replaced Chris Ramsey's spirited side in the bottom three. Only 12 minutes remained, and even if Benteke required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free-kick the overriding feeling in the Villa ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief. Benteke did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat-trick at the sound of the final whistle. On the contrary, he looked devastated. Both sides have some difficult games ahead but when Tottenham and Manchester City come next for Villa, there is plenty to concern Sherwood. A replay of QPR's goals will not make pleasant viewing. The failure to close down Bobby Zamora before he delivered the cross that enabled Matt Phillips to strike after only seven minutes. The failure to challenge Hill and so stop him scoring his first Premier League goal. The failure too to respond to the threat being posed by Austin, who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from Phillips before driving the ball past Brad Guzan. Such frailties could yet drag Villa down this season, and Sherwood knows it. 'We are not equipped unfortunately to go anywhere and dig out a result,' he complained afterwards, and on this evidence he would appear to be right. .  . Aston Villa (4-4-2): Guzan 6; Bacuna 6, Vlaar 5.5, Clark 6, Richardson 6; Cleverley 6.5, Sanchez 6.5, Delph 7, Grealish 6.5; Agbonlahor 7.5, Benteke 8. Manager: Tim Sherwood 7.

CLICK HERE to view our brilliant Match Zone - including Christian Benteke's second goal. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood threw down his gilet in celebration after Benteke scored the early equaliser. Benteke was at the double in the opening 45, sweeping beyond Green to put Villa ahead just after the half hour. Defender Clint Hill was the unexpected scorer of QPR's equaliser just after half-time to make it 2-2. Hill grabs the Queens Park Rangers badge in celebration after scoring his first ever Premier League goal. Charlie Austin got ahead of Ron Vlaar and had looked as if he'd won the game for QPR. At times his side were excellent here, thrilling their supporters with a tremendous first half display. Phillips might have landed the first blow for QPR but the players he was probably referring to as 'the icing on the cake' were giving him plenty of cause for celebration. They were attacking with great flair and finesse, with the pace of individuals like Gabriel Agbonlahor and Leandro Bacuna and the sheer power of Benteke. The call for more men made Sherwood's selection of 19-year-old Jack Grealish somewhat curious. But the teenager too was performing well. More than man enough for the occasion. As a game it was something of an emotional rollercoaster, even if the warmth of the embrace between Sherwood and Ramsey before kick-off was soon replaced by the cold reality of a dire situation for both teams. Never one to hide his feelings, Sherwood responded to QPR's opening seventh minute goal by unzipping the aforementioned gilet in disgust. It was understandable really, given how meekly his defenders tried to stop Zamora from delivering the cross Phillips then headed home from close range. Only three minutes later and the same gilet was off altogether, Sherwood throwing it to the ground after seeing Benteke's shot take a nasty deflection off Mauricio Isla's trailing foot and loop over Rob Green. . The drama in the technical area added to the sense of excitement around Villa Park. The atmosphere was electric, the place almost erupting again when Grealish so nearly marked his first Premier League start with a goal. Benteke delivered a perfect ball into the path of the teenage winger only for Green to make the save at his feet. Sherwood's decision to play a midfield diamond and exploit the pace of his attackers was working well for Villa. Not everyone seemed to agree, and at one stage Sherwood seemed to be placating a fan who didn't seem quite so impressed. But his team were playing with real verve, with Benteke scoring a second after 33 minutes with a goal that owed as much to the speed, vision and courage of Agbonlahor as the precision of the finish. Agbonlahor was just quick enough to send Benteke clear before being hacked down by Sandro, and remained curled up in a ball while his colleague raced towards goal. Benteke finished cleverly, shaping to shoot beyond Hill before dragging his effort back inside the QPR defender and beyond the reach of a wrong-footed Green. . Austin salutes the travelling Rangers supporters inside Villa Park but they weren't able to cling on to the points . But Benteke's wonder free-kick, much like Jason Puncheon's on Monday night, meant Villa came away with a point. Benteke can't conceal his delight at completing his hat-trick and rescuing a point in the 83rd minute. Good friends Chris Ramsey (left) and Sherwood know each other well and were going head-to-head in the dugout for the first time. Former Villa striker Stan Collymore couldn't hit his elation in the press box after Benteke knocked in his second of the goal. Sherwood urges the supporters packed inside Villa Park to up the ante as they looked to move clear of trouble . Charlie Austin vies for possession with Kieran Richardson during an intense and entertaining first half. Niko Kranjcar attempts to get QPR back in the game but couldn't steer his effort beyond the American Guzan. Villa Park looked a picture on Tuesday night as the two relegation battlers went head-to-head in Birmingham . Sherwood said Ramsey was one of the finest coaches he had worked with and he certainly impressed here. He had seen how his forwards had been starved of service in the first half and responded after six minutes of the second by making two substitutions. It had the desired effect, Hill equalising four minutes later; punishment for what appeared to be Bacuna's failure to stay with his man. Austin's goal – his 17th in the Premier League this season - would be a further source of concern, even if Benteke did then level for a second time with a wonderful free-kick that beat Green via the inside of a post. Are they man enough? Only time will tell.",

    "document": "It's all Pep Guardiola's fault; him and the good folk of Scotland or, at least, St Andrews. It is a simplification, of course, but perhaps a useful way of understanding why, as we survey the Champions League quarter finals, there are no Premier League clubs troubling the scorers. Bayern Munich take on Porto on Wednesday night and even though they are contending with an injury crisis which leaves them without Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben among others you might anticipate a sixth Champions League semi-final for Guardiola in his six years of management. Of course Guardiola isn't alone responsible for the decline of the Premier League in Europe; nor is it really down to St Andrews, though the iconic town with its genteel ambience played its part in continental Europe overhauling the English clubs. Pep Guardiola prepares his side for their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Porto. The Bayern boss gives instructions to his goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at a training session on Tuesday. Something happened back in 2008 when Guardiola took over at Barcelona and it wasn't that the Barcelona team changed. Frank Rijkaard had virtually the same players but Guardiola managed to find an extra 25 per cent of performance in them. What happened was a tactical change which had at its roots in St Andrews, where the Barcelona team spent their first pre season under Guardiola. There Messi was a distracted individual, sometimes sneering at Guardiola's insistence on organisation and pressing, according to Guillem Balague's account in his biographies of Messi and Guardiola. But a breakthrough came when Guardiola stuck up for Messi in his battle with the club to play for Argentina in the Beijing Olympics. The new manager took the young Argentinian under his wing, sidling up to him after training, putting his arm round him to assure him of his support. Guardiola is bidding to reach his sixth Champions League semi-final in his six years as a manager. Guardiola got Messi on side in 2008 after standing up for him in battle to represent Argentina at the Beijing Olympics. Messi, the precocious star, suddenly felt he had an ally in Guardiola. And, as a result, he began to buy into Guardiola's idea of relentless pressing to supplement the tiki taka football, which was already a template at Barcelona. For tiki taka is not what made Guardiola’s team great. 'I loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka. It's rubbish and has no purpose.' It sounds like Sam Allardyce, but those are the words of the great high priest of possession football as reported by Marti Perarnau in his book Pep Confidential. What Guardiola added to Barcelona’s game was the intensity, drive and sheer energy which had wilted under Rijkaard and then moulded it with overwhelming possession. Sometimes, when assessing the English problem in Europe, it helps to reverse the question. So, rather than ask 'Why are we so bad now?' it useful to identify why were we so good between 2005-2009?' Guardiola led Barcelona to Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011 (pictured) The former Barcelona manager is thrown into the air by his players as they celebrate the 2011 success. For Chelsea fans pointing to the 2012 triumph, that it was indeed a victory of rare courage amidst adversity but the decline of English clubs had already begun and that win is effectively an outlier, bucking the established trend. Between 2005-2009 the Premier League provided 12 out of the potential 20 semi finalists for the Champions League; between 2010 to 2015 it has provided three out of 24. Even asking that question is revealing as what English clubs were really good at during that period was making the semi finals and the final rather than winning the trophy. Only Liverpool and Manchester United actually achieved that in the five-year period of English ascendancy, though, of course, Chelsea did so improbably in 2012. What was different about English clubs in that period was the injection of some of the finest tactical minds in the game to the Premier League. Jose Mourinho may never have won the trophy with Chelsea but he transformed their approach and arguably provided the foundations for the 2008 final and the remarkable 2012 win. Rafael Benitez was an extraordinary force, the Diego Simeone of that era, regularly out-witting Mourinho and taking a relatively normal Liverpool team to two finals. Guus Hiddink engineered a fine run to the semi finals building on the work of Mourinho. Manchester United won the Champions League in 2008 when English clubs were dominating the latter stages. Chelsea were an exception to the rule in 2012 when they won the tournament against all the odds. Rising to the challenge of Mourinho and Benitez, Sir Alex Ferguson was tactically at his peak in that period, playing without a recognised centre foward at times in 2008 before Guardiola and others made it fashionable. English teams had always had an intensity with which continental teams had sometimes struggled to cope. What they had lacked often was organisation and tactical nous. Benitez, Mourinho, Hiddink provided that and Ferguson responded. Put all that together and you have a cultural melting pot which, allied to the commercial success of the Premier League, was pushing players and teams to new heights. The Premier League’s TV money of course brought in good, technical foreign players which helped but that does not seem to be the key reason for its success. The money is bigger now and those players still come but it hasn't helped Manchester City. At the zenith of the Premier League's dominance, the 2008 Moscow final, ten English players started the game. Manchester City were eliminated in the last 16 this season at the hands of Barcelona. Chelsea exited at the same stage as England have no representatives in the quarter-finals. When Jurgen Klinsmann spoke about the tactical revolution he was attempting to forge in Germany in 2006 - a style of play which has since evolved at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich - he explicitly referenced the Premier League and its pace. He recognised that continental Europe had fallen behind. It was new tactical ideas meeting the traditional attributes of the English game which helped the Premier League dominate Europe. Conversely, it was Guardiola - and others, such as Jurgen Klopp, Louis van Gaal, Jupp Heynckes - surpassing that intensity which in turn overhauled the Premier League. Clubs such as Barca, Bayern, Dortmund have retained their technical superiority over English clubs but they are now likely to out-run them and out-press them. In reality there is no one man responsible for that change. And, Guardiola's obsession with pressing is rooted in an admiration for South American football and especially Marcelo Bielsa, rather than the Premier League. But when that change took place, the Premier League lost its competitive edge. And when Guardiola put his arm around Messi at St Andrews back in the summer of 2008 and convinced his young protege to buy into that pressing game, European football changed forever.",

United have more silverware in their trophy cabinet, but City have had the better of their local rivals during the last couple of years. Last November's 1-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium was the fourth successive derby win for City. The last time they achieved that feat was 60 years ago. Ashley Young (right) wants to avoid a fifth successive derby defeat by neighbours Manchester City. Ander Herrera celebrates scoring as United move above City for the first time this season. United have lost the last four derbies to City:. 8 April 2013         United 1-2 City. 22 Sept 2013       City 4-1 United. 25 March 2014    United 0-3 City. 2 Nov 2014          City 1-0 United. United have never lost five straight matches to their local rivals and Young wants to end City's dominance this weekend when the Blues come to Old Trafford. 'That's something you want to put right,' the United winger said when asked about City's recent dominance in this fixture. 'It will be another massive game.' Despite City's recent success in derbies, United go into the match as favourites after registering five straight league wins. That run has helped United move into third, one point ahead of City, who slipped to their third defeat in five games at Crystal Palace on Monday. The champions defeat by Crystal Palace was Manchester City's third loss in five games. Young thinks United have a good chance of defeating the Barclays Premier League champions if they maintain their current form. He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play.' Finishing above City would represent a major coup for manager Louis van Gaal, especially after the way his team started the season. But, wary of the fact that seven matches remain, Young is not letting himself get too carried away despite United's recent upturn in form. Sergio Aguero (right) celebrates after scoring the winner in the last Manchester derby in November 2014. 'It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes,' the 29-year-old said. 'It is obviously going to be another tough one against City next week but we will prepare as well as we can do as we always do.' Young's form has been key to United's recovery. The former Aston Villa midfielder has been so good recently that he has kept record signing Angel di Maria out of the United team. That has not been enough to get him back into the England squad though. Many tipped Young to earn an England recall after 19 months in the wilderness, but manager Roy Hodgson left him out of his squad to face Lithuania and Italy. Young is hoping his revival at Old Trafford can force him back into England reckoning. Young revealed Hodgson did not call him to explain his absence from the 24-man party when it was announced. 'There was no conversation (with Hodgson),' said Young, whose last England cap came against Ukraine in September 2013. 'Obviously I will always want to represent my country.

Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palace’s fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving.

It has got unbelievable potential and I mean that. The supporters are wonderful and they have a good manager. They can push on – if Alan is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward this club could be a good club.’ Yannick Bolasie even made the effort to go over and shake Pulis’ hand as he strolled down the touchline. Yet the south London locals would not have been expecting what came within two minutes of kick off when West Brom took the lead. Chris Bunt swung in a corner from the left and James Morrison managed to lose Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon and nod in, completely free, from five yards out. Some of Puncheon’s team-mates looked around in disbelief that the West Brom man was afforded so much space in the box. ‘That was a weakness in our set up that Tony exploited,’ Pardew admitted. ‘It was well worked. Their guy took Puncheon to the edge of the box where he is not comfortable marking. ‘We knew Tony would know the players well, know the strengths and weaknesses, I tried to throw a few ideas in on the pitch. They didn’t come off. . Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie greets former Eagles boss Tony Pulis (right) before kick-off at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon.

People know Tony does an honest job, he plays the game his way and we respect that.’ Despite that early set back, however, Crystal Palace started to play the eye-catching football that has made Pardew so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge. And it was all coming through their main man, Bolasie, on the left. In the 24th minute he weaved into the box, played a one-two then poked an effort towards the near post which West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill did well to save with his feet. Three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that Myhill clawed out. Then, just after the half-hour, a ball came in from the opposite flank from Joel Ward, was headed on by Glenn Murray and Bolasie executed a sublime bicycle kick, only to be denied by Myhill once again. . If Pulis, dressed in his usual full tracksuit, trainers and cap on the touchline, provided this Crystal Palace team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight, Pardew, resplendent in suit and tie, has given them the suave and flair to delight. In this instance, Pulis’ resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes. The ball came out from a West Brom corner and Gardner took a touch before, 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, he buried a right-foot strike over Julian Speroni into the left of goal. It is almost mission accomplished for Pulis at West Brom as they moved to 36 points and put a healthy gap between themselves and the bottom three. .

    "document": "On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled \"Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,\" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \"what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,\" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans \"targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction.\" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book \"Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,\" notes, \"the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems.\" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? \"Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!\" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. \"This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it.\" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.",

    "document": "Bearing in mind he’s a dog, Don the border collie did a pretty good job yesterday of piloting a tractor across a motorway. To be fair, however, this probably wasn’t the first thought to strike rush-hour drivers as they watched him crash through a fence and come hurtling towards them. Like a scene from Wallace and Gromit, the intrepid sheepdog was at the controls when he sent the farm utility vehicle down a steep bank, on to the busy carriageway and into the central reservation barrier. Don's owner Tom Hamilton (pictured) was tending to a lamb when the sheepdog took control by nudging the controls. The tractor smashed through a fence before ending up on the road. Don was unhurt in the ordeal but the incident caused major tailbacks. Despite considerable damage, Don escaped unhurt – but left scores of motorists wondering if they were imagining things. . Traffic Scotland tweeted a bizarre warning that there may be hold-ups ‘due to a dog taking control of tractor’, adding: ‘Nope, not joking.’ . Appropriately, they couldn’t resist the hashtag: ‘#maycausetailbacks’. Observers and Twitter commentators joined the pun fun by speculating: ‘Police investigating – so far no leads’; or the inevitable: ‘This is barking.’ . The incident happened at junction 13 of the M74, near Abington in South Lanarkshire. Sheep farmer Tom Hamilton was travelling across a field in the John Deere Gator farm vehicle with his companion in the passenger seat during their morning rounds. Behind the wheel: Don leaned on the controls of the tractor before driving it on to the M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire during rush hour. The vehicle shot out of the field and crashed down a bank by the side of the road before colliding with the central reservation of the M74 near junction 13 northbound as shown by the red arrow. Moments after he got out of the vehicle, it took off with Don at the wheel. . Safely back at nearby Kirkton Farm yesterday with Don at his side, Mr Hamilton explained: ‘I was sorting out one of the lambs and hadn’t put the brake on. ‘When I turned around I saw it racing towards the motorway. I ran after it but I couldn’t catch up.’ . Traffic Scotland tweeted the news that a dog had 'taken control of a tractor' before adding, 'nope, not joking' Officers cleared the motorway within half an hour and Don was reunited with his relieved owner at nearby Kirkton Farm. Remarkably, drivers managed to avoid the runaway vehicle before it came to crashing halt, and none was hurt. . Nor did the black and white border collie (a breed noted for its intelligence and obedience) panic or flee in terror. . ‘He didn’t even bark,’ Mr Hamilton said. . Police said Don had set the vehicle in motion by inadvertently leaning on the controls. ‘So far people seem to find it amusing,’ Mr Hamilton said. . ‘But I think Don’s driving days are over.’ . Monty, a giant schnauzer cross, was pictured driving a mini down a race track in New Zealand in 2012.",

    "document": "Friends and neighbours. For the next 48 hours, however, the pint will have to stay behind the bar as Chris Ramsey and Tim Sherwood go toe to toe in the scrap for survival. As far as QPR manager Ramsey is concerned, Sherwood’s Aston Villa are in no danger of tumbling out of the Barclays Premier League, despite their lowly position. . The verdict is delivered on the evidence that Ramsey has gathered in four years of working alongside Sherwood at Tottenham. Chris Ramsey believes his friend and neighbour Tim Sherwood will keep Aston Villa in the Premier League. But the QPR boss will be pulling no punches when he clashes with his former Tottenham colleague on Tuesday. QPR scored four goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since March 1994 v Norwich (4-3). . ‘Without a shadow of a doubt I think he will keep them up,’ said Ramsey. ‘He has a good squad, players who have the wow factor and he knows how to manipulate those particular players. . 'If I was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do, I would be putting a bet on him keeping them up.’. Ramsey will be doing his utmost to extend Villa’s top-flight uncertainty on Tuesday night and has reason for optimism given Rangers’ stunning victory at West Bromwich Albion. . Ramsey says if he 'was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do,' he would bet on Villa staying up. QPR celebrate the second of their four goals against West Brom from Charle Austin (right) A second win in the Birmingham area in four days would send QPR above Villa on goal difference. Sherwood and Ramsey, a duo operating as boss and assistant last season at Spurs, will share words in advance. ‘Me, him and Les (Ferdinand) live probably 10 minutes from each other so sometimes there is a pint to be had. I’m sure we’ll speak before the game,’ added Ramsey. ‘We worked together at Tottenham for four years in various jobs,’ said Ramsey. ‘It’s great you can have two coaches who’ve gone through the system and are coaching in the Premier League. The game has to look at it from an English point of view. ‘If things hadn’t gone our way against West Brom then the mountain looks a little bit bigger. The game will be very important for both teams.’. Ramsey and Sherwood were in the trenches together at Spurs and live within 10 minutes of each other. The perspective for Ramsey’s team is more positive after putting four past a West Brom side who for the first half looked to have beach on the brain already. . Joey Barton scored in added time at the Hawthorns to underline the emphatic victory, having six minutes earlier received a forearm in the face from Youssouf Mulumbu that saw the Albion midfielder sent off. That ended any chance of a comeback for the hosts, who trailed 3-0 at the break but pulled one back through Victor Anichebe. First half goals from Eduardo Vargas, Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora, who scored a wonderful lob with the outside of his left boot, did the damage. Eduardo Vargas celebrates the opener for QPR in the remarkable 4-1 win over West Brom on Saturday. Bobby Zamora (left) scored QPR's third goal with an astounding lob to give his side a 3-0 half-time lead. Austin’s strike was his 16th in the Premier League this season and Barton suggested he would have an England cap by now were he in a more fashionable side. ‘It helps if you play for certain clubs to play for England,’ said the QPR midfielder. ‘Certain people who haven’t done as well as Charlie, who has scored so many goals in a struggling side, seem to be shoo-ins in the England side.’. QPR captain Joey Barton celebrates his goal, his team's fourth, late in the game at The Hawthorns.  .",

    "document": "Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. . 1. Dick Advocaat might consider bringing in referee Anthony Taylor to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play. The official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from Yannick Bolasie when he completed his hat-trick for Crystal Palace in the 4-1 demolition of Sunderland. Top marks for him – but none at all for Lee Cattermole who was goal side of Bolasie before the breakaway began, yet way behind the official when the goal went in. Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when James McArthur’s clearance began the move, but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net. Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole before scoring his hat-trick goal against Sunderland . Cattermole was goal side of Bolasie before the Crystal Palace winger went on to score his third goal. Referee Anthony Taylor sprinted past Sunderland midfielder Cattermole during Bolasie's impessive run. Bolasie starred in Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . 2. Gary Cahill has responded to the challenge of fighting Kurt Zouma for his place in Chelsea’s defence and looks to be winning the battle. When it got tough for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road it was Cahill who responded best to ensure Cesc Fabregas’ late striker was a winner. Cahill made 15 clearances – as many as the rest of Chelsea’s back four put together – and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball. Gary Cahill has managed to win back his starting spot alongside John Terry after his brief absence . Chelsea starlet Kurt Zouma had deputised for Cahill during the England international's stint on the sidelines . 3. Arsene Wenger’s decision to axe goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after fining him for smoking in the showers at Southampton has proved a pivotal point of Arsenal’s season. The 1-0 victory at Burnley was the sixth clean sheet the Gunners had kept in 12 Premier League games since David Ospina took over – one more than they’d achieved in the previous 20. More important, Arsenal have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing Wojciech Szczesny . 4. Vincent Kompany’s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost Manchester City needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign. City were in the middle of a 14-game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals Arsenal at the end of January – a game they lost 2-0. The 4-2 collapse at Old Trafford made it 14 matches since then, of which City have lost eight. Belgian star Kompany has missed only one of them – a 2-0 win over Leicester which saw one of only three clean sheets. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has struggled for form during the past few weeks . 5. West Brom’s 'Jeff Astle day' provided a nostalgic trip back in time, with Albion’s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 (goalkeeper Boaz Myhill wore no number, like John Osborne back then). But there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football’s black and white days – every one of Albion’s players wore coloured boots. Four red pairs, two orange, two white, one blue, one yellow – and captain Darren Fletcher’s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher wore multicoloured boots on 'Jeff Astle day' at The Hawthorns. 6. When Paul Lambert was sacked in early February, Aston Villa had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. It’s taken Tim Sherwood just 10 games to overtake that total – Christian Benteke’s winner at White Hart Lane was the 16th scored since his appointment. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has returned to form since Tim Sherwood's arrival at Villa Park. 7. James Ward-Prowse backed up manager Ronald Koeman’s faith by tucking away the penalty against Hull that put Southampton on the path to a 2-0 win. Koeman had to shout orders from the bench to let the England youngster take the kick as Senegalese striker Sadio Mane picked up the ball to head for the spot first. You couldn’t blame Mane for wanting to jump the queue – Ward-Prowse had never scored a Premier League goal in 68 previous appearances for the Saints, and none of his four England Under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman ensured James Ward-Prowse took penalty ahead of Sadio Mane . 8. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation. The London-born product of the Royals’ youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0-0 draw with Blackburn in his first start for 16 months – just in time to be available for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. He has a good chance of playing at Wembley after helping make the defence more solid. It was the first time Steve Clarke’s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine Championship games. Reading's Jem Karacan made his first start for 16 months against Blackburn on Saturday afternoon. 9. Taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in League One – it’s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years (Gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010) This season looks like being different, though, after Crewe’s draw with Leyton Orient left both clubs plus Crawley on 47 points with four games still to play. That means sleepless nights for Crawley boss Dean Saunders who’ll have bad memories of going down from the Championship with Wolves despite finishing on 51 points. Crawley Town are in danger of dropping down to League Two despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games . 10. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has the curious middle name of Armani – and he’s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set-pieces. The 22-year-old is on his third loan of the season from Bristol City because Pilgrims boss John Sheridan admires his pinpoint accuracy with a dead ball. He showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free-kick in a 2-1 win over Mansfield that put Plymouth back into the League Two play-off places. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has taken League Two by storm since being loaned out by Bristol City.  .",

    "document": "Adam Federici lay inert on the turf for a moment. He realised the magnitude of what happened. He understood the horror of it instantly. He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time. It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe. The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game. Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp. Reading had fought valiantly but were unable to score another equaliser to take the tie to penalties. Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. The Reading goalkeeper, who had been magnificent until then, left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him. Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved. Reading: Federici, Gunter, Hector, Pearce, Obita, McCleary, Williams, Chalobah (Cox, 106), Robson-Kanu (Karacan, 90), Mackie, Pogrebnyak (Yakubu, 111). . Subs not used: Stephen Kelly, Norwood, Yakubu, Andersen, Cooper. Booked: Chalobah. Goal: McCleary, 54 . Arsenal: Szczesny, Debuchy, Mertesacker (Gabriel, 63), Koscielny, Gibbs, Coquelin (Walcott, 101), Cazorla, Ramsey, Ozil, Sanchez, Welbeck (Giroud, 72). . Subs not used: Wilshere, Ospina,  Monreal, Flamini. Goals: Sanchez 39, 106. When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season’s Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. ‘I am happy we are through,’ said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. ‘But I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him — I have been there, done that.’. Clarke did his best to ease Federici’s pain, too. ‘This is the life of a goalkeeper,’ said the Reading boss. ‘And Adam is a top goalkeeper. There’s every chance he’ll be Reading’s player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. ‘We stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. He’ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham I’m sure he’ll be as good as he always is.’. Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wenger’s team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenal’s fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled. .

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (centre) gives instructions out to his team before the beginning of extra time. Federici’s mistake gave them an escape route that they followed eagerly. They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate. . Gabriel (right), a replacement for Per Mertesacker, powers a header at goal shortly after Reading had scored. But Reading goalkeeper Federici made a splendid one-handed save to tip the ball up and against the crossbar. Sanchez (centre) earlier took the ball past goalkeeper  Federici (second left) before losing his footing and falling. Daniel Williams (left) shoots at goal for Reading against Arsenal at Wembley but his attempt went wide of the goal. It seemed then that Arsenal would extend their lead. Reading’s threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbs’ head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands. Redemption was not far away for him. It will take longer to greet Federici. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has an effort blocked by Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici.

    "document": "Barcelona will offer £50million for in-demand Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, and plan to let him stay in Italy for a year on loan. Spanish press reports indicate Chelsea are their only rivals for the Frenchman's signature. Pogba is one of Europe's most in demand young talents but Spanish paper SPORT say that the leaders in La Liga and the Barclays Premier League are the only two viable destinations for the 22-year-old Frenchman. With Barcelona currently under the restrictions of a FIFA-imposed transfer ban until the January window, Pogba would have to be loaned back to Juve until the 2016-17 season as part of any prospective deal. . SPORT say Barcelona will make a £50m offer for Paul Pogba while Marca look at the race for La Liga. Pogba is said to be the subject of a £50m bid from Barca with Chelsea their only realistic transfer rivals. Lionel Messi returned to training for Barcelona after a foot problem ahead of facing Celta Vigo. SPORT claim that Pogba has listened to Barca's offer but is yet to decide on his future with four years remaining on his contract with the Italian champions. The Catalan daily also say that Lionel Messi has recovered from a problem with swelling on his foot to start for Barca in their return to La Liga against Celta Vigo on Sunday after making it through a training session unscathed. Also in Spain, Marca look at Real Madrid's quest to overhaul their perennial rivals at the top of La Liga. They say that if Real win their final 10 games to take a total points haul of 94, they can count on winning the title. That might be easier said than done, however. No team has won their last 10 games in La Liga in the last decade, no matter how sure Real are that Barca will falter. L'Equipe look ahead to a big weekend in the French title race, A Bola pin Benfica's hopes on Nicolas Gaitan. David Luiz and PSG have made their way to the top of Ligue 1 but that position will be challenge this weekend. Marseille and their star striker Andre-Pierre Gignac will want to knock PSG off the top of the table. It's a huge weekend in France with Le Classique top of the bill, Lyon getting the opportunity to top the table and Monaco taking on St Etienne. With that in mind, L'Equipe go with the headline: 'The hunt is on'. Champions PSG are still in with a shout of an unprecedented treble, sitting top of Ligue 1 with eight games to go, in the semi-finals of the French Cup and having reached the last eight of the Champions League. But their abilities are certain to be tested on Sunday night in a first vs third clash against Marseille at a packed 67,394-capacity Stade Velodrome. A difficult April schedule makes it important that PSG stay top of the table in Marseille, having struggled to maintain a title challenge for much of the season. Gaitan is viewed as the key man for Benfica as they look to open up a gap on Porto in Portugal. Manager Jorge Jesus said Gaitan is a star of different characteristics to his other players, with no equal. With nearest rivals Porto faltering, A Bola in France focus on Nicolas Gaitan's position as Benfica's leader as they look to wrap up the Primeira Liga title in the coming weeks. Benfica boss Jorge Jesus said of Gaitan: 'Nico is a player of different characteristics, we have no equal to him. 'He's a player with a lot of influence and he can be with us for many years. He is a leader on the pitch and it's good to know that he will be with us.' Benfica face Nacional on Saturday hoping to keep up their excellent home form which has seen them concede just two goals at the Estadio da Luz all season. The Italian papers have gone big on the race for a place in next season's Champions League. Carlos Tevez (left) could add PSG to his list of clubs if reports in the Italian press are to be believed. Finally, the Italian papers are going big on the race with the Champions League. Both Corriere dello Sport and Tuttosport look to Saturday's Roma-Napoli showdown as the first of a few clashes to decide the placings at the top of the table come the end of the season. . Corriere also note that PSG could be a possible destination for Pogba, and that they are looking for a double swoop on Juventus with Carlos Tevez also a target. . There is also a small mention for how Carlo Ancelotti could return to manage AC Milan from Real Madrid if the Spanish club call time on their Italian manager. .  .",

    "document": "When Jack Wilshere was first showing signs of his enormous potential at Luton Town’s academy, the big boys down the road soon came calling. Everyone was into little Wilshere, with West Ham (the team his dad Andy supports), Tottenham and Arsenal all offering to give Luton’s academy kid a shot at the highest level. Wilshere was a Hitchin boy, spotted early by Luton’s scouts before Arsenal took him to their Hale End academy at nine. At 16, he made his first-team debut for Arsene Wenger’s side. Charlie Patino, 11, and his family must weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Arsenal star Jack Wilshere he is a talented midfelder who has been spotted at Luton Town. Soon it will be decision time for another Luton discovery as 11-year-old Charlie Patino and his parents Julio and Katy weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Jack, he is a midfielder. The Patinos are a level-headed family, absorbing the enormity of the offers on the table from three of the biggest clubs in the Premier League before they come to a decision at the end of the season. ‘We just want what’s best for Charlie, to give him the best chance of being a professional footballer if that is what he wants to do,’ said dad Julio on Wednesday. ‘He is a dedicated boy, he works hard at school, gets good grades and is committed to playing football. He just loves it.’. Charlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. ‘Other parents have commented on it in the past,’ admitted Julio. The big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA’s compensation guidelines. The transfer fee involved is £10,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton. There are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision. Charlie, pictured with his sister Lily and dog Truffles, would cost £10,000 and is a season ticket holder at Luton. 11-year-old analyses Spanish football and his style of play has been influenced by favourite team Barcelona. Julio’s parents are both Spanish. They moved to England in the Sixties before their son was born in England. Charlie watches live La Liga games on Sky Sports. Julio, who is a supporter of La Liga strugglers Deportivo La Coruna, added: ‘Charlie doesn’t watch the Spanish football, he analyses it. His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.’. Charlie’s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents’ home in London Colney, Hertfordshire. Soon enough he was invited to play for Luton, often playing in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability with the ball. He has a superior touch and a great feel for the ball, making the game appear effortless. He trains six times a week, spending more than 10 hours a week playing in various age groups at Luton’s highly respected academy before playing a game on a Sunday for the club. Julio, who works in the telecommunications industry, and mum Katy, who works for Marks & Spencer, insist their son has been unaffected by the interest from London’s three biggest clubs, who made their initial moves a few months ago. Charlie has often played in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability on the ball. He trains six hours a week, spending more than 10 hours a week at Luton (pictured Kenilworth Road) The Patino family have already visited the training grounds of Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea with their son, listening to the sales pitches and making it clear that they will take their time. ‘Charlie is only 11 but he gets it and he knows what is happening to him,’ added his dad. ‘He knows that this is a big opportunity to train with a top club, even though there are no guarantees at the end of it.’. The Patinos have been guided through the process by Luton, with the club’s chief executive Gary Sweet making sure that they have been kept fully informed. Julio intends to continue to take his son to Kenilworth Road next season even though Charlie will be settling into his new club. ‘Everybody at Luton has been fantastic and it is a very impressive set-up,’ he added. ‘They have really looked after Charlie over the years.’. The Patino family live near London Colney and have visited Arsenal, Spurs and Chelsea's training grounds.  .",

    "document": "REJECTION PROOF. by Jia Jiang. (Random House, £13.99) Who likes rejection? Whether you are being rejected by a lover, an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you, it’s galling. And in every case there’s nothing we can do about it. Nothing that doesn’t carry a long prison sentence, anyway. It would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis, and Jia Jiang is both of those. Born into a family of teachers, Jia Jiang was so determined to become an entrepreneur that, as a child in China, he dug a hole in the garden, intending to reach America by the shortest route. He eventually made the journey by conventional means, and found a good life there. Wife, children, several degrees, job in middle management. But he wasn’t happy. He wanted to take risks, start his own company. It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there’s nothing we can do about it (picture posed by model) . The problem was he inevitably encountered rejection, mainly from potential backers for his project (another iPhone app no one could possibly need or want). And each time, rejection felt like the end of the world. A successful entrepreneur needed to be more robust than this. So, having possibly read one self-help book too many, Jia Jiang decided to embark on his own rejection-proofing quest. Instead of avoiding rejection, he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected, film them and put them up on his blog. All of which seemed to me, at first glance, rather artificial. There have been any number of ‘quest’ books, in which humorous writers have gone round Ireland with a fridge, for example, less for the sake of doing it than to write a book about it. But Jia Jiang isn’t a humorous writer. He may adopt a light-hearted tone, but his quest was deadly serious. On day one, he went up to a security guard and asked if he could borrow $100. The security guard said no, and Jia almost broke into a run to get away. Watching the video later, he said he looked like the man in Munch’s The Scream. On day two, he went into a burger joint and, noticing a sign on the soft drinks machine saying ‘Free refill’, asked the cashier for a burger refill. The cashier said no. But as he continued his quest, Jia realised there were ways and ways of asking. Show confidence, inject a little bit of humour, be willing to negotiate and you might not get exactly what you want, but you might get something. So he walked into Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and asked for a set of five iced doughnuts, interlocking in the manner of the Olympic symbol. The woman behind the counter looked thoughtful. ‘When are you looking for these?’ she asked. ‘In the next . . . 15 minutes?’. ‘Let me see what I can do,’ she said. And did it. You can see what happened next on YouTube. And so develops a surprisingly entertaining study of rejection in all its many manifestations. People confuse it with failure, but rejection is personal, and we take it personally. The crucial point is that rejection is unavoidable and it’s how we respond to it that matters. Jia Jiang’s extreme positivity can grate at times but his message is sound: rejection is only someone else’s opinion, and it may not be the right one.  .",

    "document": "Joko Widodo's chief political rival reportedly promised to publicly support the Indonesian president if he granted clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved, The West Australian reported. It's understood Mr Prabowo penned a letter to Mr Joko at the weekend in which he said that if the president were to 'postpone the executions indefinitely', he would come out in support of the decision. Scroll down for video . Indonesian President Joko Widodo (left) ignored reassurances from his chief political rival Prabowo Subianto (right) that he would support a decision to grant clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved. Independent senator Nick Xenophon said he was told earlier in the year by human rights advocates that Mr Prabowo - who narrowly lost the presidential elections to Mr Joko in October - was 'very sympathetic' to clemency. As well, he could see that the executions of Chan and Sukumaran could damage relations between Australia and Indonesia. 'I was advised at the time that it would be a bad idea to approach him, so I didn't,' Senator Xenophon told ABC radio. 'One view was that it would enrage President Widodo and make matters worse, and I guess we'll never know.' . This comes after a senior Indonesian government official praised the firing squad that executed Bali Nine pair and six other convicted drug traffickers. ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for their work.  . 'All shots were done perfectly. These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January,' he said. . Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March. Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo (right) applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for the good job that they did. Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country, as he dismissed Australia's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction'. He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday, hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders. 'I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing. It is not a fun job,' he said. 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs. We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came. What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes. . 'Therefore, I would like to offer my condolences, on the execution of those who were on the death row, to their families, to their home countries. 'Once again, we are not against the countries, but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation's survival.' Mr Prasetyo (second right) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly' at the execution. The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions  as 'cruel and unnecessary' and announced he would withdraw Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson. 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,' he said. 'I think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere.' Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest. 'Within a month or two, they will come back. That's the signal of protest, we did that too,' he said, referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan. Rest in peace: Myuran Sukumaran (foreground) and Andrew Chan (back) were executed . Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others. 'This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes,' he told reporters in Cilacap. . 'The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last,' he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely' this time. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo raised his nation's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador. 'Our sovereignty must be respected,' he told reporters. 'We're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well.' . Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect' Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, is widely regarded as weak.

    "document": "There can be no doubt that the bone-jarring collisions we see on Saturday will be far more substantial than the flick from David Beckham's right boot which led to Diego Simeone collapsing in apparent agony on the same pitch 17 years ago. This mouth-watering repeat of last year's European Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne's famous Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be no place for faint-hearted souls like Argentina's 1998 football World Cup captain. Instead, Saracens head coach Mark McCall wants warriors. Twenty-three of them, to be exact, if every player in his squad gets on to the field to face a Clermont Auvergne team that made Aviva Premiership champions Northampton look like a pub side only two weeks ago. Veteran fly half Charlie Hodgson will run the show for Saracens against Clermont on Saturday . England centre Brad Barritt will captain Mark McCall's side against at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Owen Farrell has recovered from a knee injury and has been named on the bench for the big clash . CLERMONT AUVERGNE: N Abendanon; N Nakaitaci, J Davies, W Fofana, N Nalaga; B James, L Radosavljevic; V Debaty, B Kayser, D Zirakashvili, J Cudmore, S Vahaamahina, J Bonnaire, D Chouly (capt), J Bardy. SARACENS: A Goode; C Ashton, M Bosch, B Barritt (capt), C Wyles; C Hodgson, R Wigglesworth; M Vunipola, J George, P Du Plessis, G Kruis, J Hamilton, M Itoje, B Vunipola, J Burger. Kick-off: 3.15pm, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Etienne. . TV: LIVE on BT Sport 1 from 2.30pm. Referee: George Clancy (Ireland). Jacques Burger, Clermont's nemesis in last year's semi-final, is back after a one-match ban while 20-year-old Maro Itoje will take the other flank in a Saracens pack that must match Clermont's monstrous eight for physicality. 'Experience tells us that in games as big and as difficult as this you need your warriors,' McCall said this week. Saracens' experience also tells them Clermont can be beaten. This time last year the sides met at the same stage and produced what many believed to be a seminal performance in Sarries' history as Vern Cotter's men were crushed 46-6 at Twickenham. There were warriors aplenty for the men in black that day as Saracens powered into their first European Cup final only to fall short against a Jonny Wilkinson-inspired Toulon in the final. Maro Itoje has been named to start at blindside flanker following a string of impressive performances . On Saturday, a similarly Herculean effort will be required against a Clermont side who have almost forgotten how to lose at their own Stade Marcel-Michelin. Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, however, is not home territory for either club, though Saracens travel as underdogs. 'Playing away from home has always galvanised us,' said Saracens battle-hardened centre Brad Barritt — captain in the absence of Alistair Hargreaves. 'Early in this team's evolution we spoke about going to these arenas where Saracens had never won and knocking over another hurdle. This is another chance to make an everlasting memory and take a massive scalp. It's something that brings the best out of this team.' Clermont have an array of attacking talent that can hurt Saracens with Wesley Fofana to the fore . Few teams know each other better, with last year's semi-final still fresh in the memory as well as two pool games this season which saw honours shared. This week McCall invited Jim McGuinness, the former Donegal gaelic football manager and current Celtic psychologist, to address the squad before training. McCall said: 'When Jim took over in 2010 Donegal hadn't won a game for three seasons and hadn't won a championship in 19. 'He took them on a journey over four seasons where they won the all-Ireland in year two and have been Ulster champions in three out of the four years he coached them. It seemed like a very similar journey to our own. Our players were captivated.' Jacques Burger (centre) was a standout performer in Saracens' 46-6 victory at Twickenham last season . Saracens are able to call on linchpin No 8 Billy Vunipola, who starts in a back row alongside Burger and Itoje who, standing 6ft 5in and weighing 18st 2lb, epitomises the modern-day rugby player. Vunipola was cleared on Tuesday of intentionally head-butting Leicester's Mathew Tait in last weekend's Premiership encounter. . With veteran fly-half Charlie Hodgson in the form of his life and Owen Farrell on the bench after recovering from the knee injury which kept him out of England's Six Nations campaign, Saracens are close to full strength. Barritt believes experience will be crucial. 'We have a squad who have been there and done it,' he said. 'We have experienced those highs and lows of winning a Premiership, losing in the final of the Premiership and consistently getting to the latter stages of the Europe. Those experiences made us a stronger and better team. McCall (above) invited  ex-Donegal gaelic football manager Jim McGuinness to speak to his side this week . 'We feel like we're in a great position for the final run-in of the season. We've won the last six or seven games. In these big games it's often about adapting to the situation and we know we have got a few strings to our bow.' Against a Clermont side capable of striking from anywhere on the field, Saracens will need all those strings. Billy Vunipola was cleared on Tuesday of intentionally head-butting Leicester full back Mathew Tait.",

Huge waves as high as 40 feet smashed glass panels, shattered plates and cups – and left many on-board violently seasick as the boat pitched from side to side. A Sydney harbour pilot finally boarded this morning and the ship, carrying 2,500 holidaymakers and 1,500 crew, docked at the Overseas Passenger Terminal at around 10am. . Scroll down for videos    . The 2500 passengers on board a cruise ship, which has been stranded at sea due to wild weather conditions, have finally arrived at Sydney Harbour this morning. Holidaymakers were due to disembark the Carnival Spirit on Tuesday morning but the Sydney storm prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. The port in Sydney reopened on Wednesday morning, allowing the ship made its way through the harbour to dock. Passengers from the cruise ship Carnival Spirit disembark at Sydney's Overseas Passenger Terminal. 'We're so relieved to just get off,' passenger Courtney Randall said as she disembarked the liner. 'Inside everyone was sick, it was really quite rocky.' 'Everyone is ready to get off,' Debbie from Cherrybrook told ABC radio as the ship headed towards the shore. Another passenger told the Sydney Morning Herald  of the horror and panic of being on board while the ship was battered had left her traumatised. 'At one stage, I looked out the window and one of the waves crashed up against the glass. I freaked out and closed the curtains. I couldn't deal with it,' Athanasia Georgoudakis, from Yagoona in Sydney's south-west, told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'This is the last [cruise]. If I want to go on holiday I will catch a plane. I will not take another cruise, never.' Vacationers were put on edge as 'a lot of water' coming through glass panels and some of the crew were also frightened by the experience. One passenger has told how many travellers have been 'vomiting for two days' due to rough seas conditions. A spokesperson for the cruise liner said that boarding is expected to commence at 2.30pm for their modified 7-day Isle de Pines vacation, with plans to set sail by 7pm.  A camera on the cruise captures the moment it finally enters Sydney Harbour on Wednesday morning. One member of staff, who had worked on cruise ships for six years said that he had been sea sick and was very relieved to be back on shore. 'I was pretty scared of the roughness because I've experienced nothing like that before,' he told Daily Mail Australia, asking not to be identified. Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves, which began crashing into the ship late on Monday. . It had been due to dock on Tuesday morning but Sydney Harbour was closed to traffic as conditions were so bad. The crew had pleaded for calm on board the ship, saying it was built to withstand the storm, which has been described as a 'once in a century' weather event. Daily Mail Australia spoke to several new passengers, who were among many waiting to check in their luggage for their week-long journey aboard the ship. One young Gold Coast couple (pictured) Caleb Dias, 18, and Chloie Rhodes, 17, could not wait to jump on board as they had been planning this trip for nearly a year. Dr Marie-Therese Proctor, of Picton which is 80km south-west of Sydney, is travelling with her teenage daughter Serena (pictured together) and told Daily Mail Australia she is confident the weather is going to clear up for their week-long trip which begins today. 2500 passengers on board the Carnival Spirit are at the mercy of the wild seas as storms batter the east coast - with the massive swell, seen from video images shot from on-board, showing just how treacherous and stomach churning the conditions are. The cruise ship Carnival Spirit has been damaged and stranded outside Sydney Harbour on Tuesday morning. The cyclonic winds battering Sydney have also caused drama for passengers on board cruise liner the Carnival Spirit which is heading south after being prevented from docking because of the heavy seas. Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves. While the ship was stuck at sea, one passenger told the Daily Telegraph that 'there was a large wave that hit at 7.30 last night that tore one of the doors off causing a whole lot of water to come flooding through the deck'. 'Even as we speak the ship is creaking and moaning,' passenger Kurt Foster said. 'Last night was absolutely horrendous. In the room all the cupboard doors were flying open and everything on the bench tops was flying off. 'One crew member has been working here for 10 years and he reckons it's the roughest he's seen.' . At 8.25am on Wednesday, Carnival Cruise Line Australia finally posted a message on their Facebook page that their ship had been cleared to dock. ‘(We) have been notified that the port in Sydney is now open to ship traffic and we're happy to say the weather has improved to allow safe entry into the port,' it read. The Carnival Spirit has 2500 passengers on board, stranded outside of Sydney Harbour because of the city's wild weather. 'The pilot is now on board and ship is proceeding to the terminal and is expected to be alongside no later than 10am. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port. 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open.’. Damage to the 293m Carnival Spirit was minor and it was scheduled to depart of for a seven-day Isle de Pines cruise this evening. Daily Mail Australia spoke to several new passengers, who were among many waiting to check in their luggage for their week-long journey aboard the ship. . Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore as the cruise ship Carnival Spirit remains stranded outside Sydney Harbour. One young Gold Coast couple Caleb Dias, 18, and Chloie Rhodes, 17, could not wait to jump on board as they had been planning this trip for nearly a year. 'I guess we're a bit nervous but I think we'll be fine and we even bought some travel sickness tablets just in case,' Mr Dias said. Dr Marie-Therese Proctor, of Picton which is 80km south-west of Sydney, is travelling with her teenage daughter Serena and told Daily Mail Australia she is confident the weather is going to clear up. 'It's disappointing that we lost one day of travel as we were supposed to leave yesterday and we would have cancelled our trip all together if it didn't sail today,' Dr Proctor said. 'But I am looking forward to some quality mother and daughter time on this trip plus I trust the crew's decision to go ahead with the trip in these conditions.' . Waves of nine metres have been battering the ship for the past 24 hours.

It comes as a friend of the teenagers who are believed to the planned attack in Melbourne revealed the moment the two young men 'became radicalised'. The man, who has not been identified, claims the death of Numan Haider was the moment 'we all became more radical', according to News Corp Australia. Scroll down for video . Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday afternoon. Multiple photos of Mr Besim on his social media pages show him posing with one raised index finger, a symbol that other ISIS supporters have also frequently used. He is one of two 18-year-old men police arrested for allegedly planning an 'ISIS inspired' attack on an Anzac Day ceremony. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured) Haider was killed by police last year after he attacked officers with a knife, and is believed to have planned an ISIS-like attack. The two alleged ringleaders of the Anzac Day plot reportedly attended Haider's funeral. The information comes after police held one of the alleged ringleaders in jail under tough new terror laws, despite not being charged. . The man, who cannot be identified due to suppression orders, could be held 14 days after police applied for a Preventive Detention Order. Another man, Sevdet Ramadan Besim, 18,  was charged with planning to carry out an  attack. Both men often visited frequented the controversial Al-Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale. It was also revealed the young men arrested on Saturday had personal links with a senior Australian jihadist and Islamic State recruiter in Syria. Police are exploring the role played in the plot by Neil Prakash, 23, who is considered to be the top Australian recruiter for ISIS, according to Fairfax Media. Prakash, who is know by the jihadist name Abu Khalid al-Kambodi, may have been in direct communication with the teenagers until recently. . Prakash is thought of in the same way as Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a former Sydney bouncer who was believed killed fighting around the Northern Syrian city of Kobane in late 2014. Mr Haider, whose body is pictured (left) being taken to the coroner for examination, died when he was shot by officers after stabbing two policemen outside a Melbourne police station on September 23.

Just two days before the teenager was arrested during pre-dawn raids at his Melbourne home, he was perusing the Facebook page of well-known radical Perth-based Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne.

Days before he arrested, Besim was browsing the Facebook page of Mohammed Junaid Thorne. Hizb Ut-Ta-Khir is an Islamic fundamentalist group who have a branch in Australia. He was arrested, along with four other teenagers, suspected of planning a terror attack using swords and knives. A number of 'edged weapons'  were seized at some of the properties searched. The father of one of the men arrested, said he believed the controversial Al Furqan Islamic study centre had changed his son's life for the better. Mr Besim did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody for a filing hearing on April 24. 'Before he started to pray, (he) was in the house aggressive, he broke (things), like a child. But after when he started to pray he really changed behaviour, 100 per cent,' the father told the ABC. . 'Now he was very good, always. Never, never yells, never, never do bad in house. . 'He's always nice talking when I see him, but I (do) not see him very much.' .

Another picture expresses his thoughts on the democratic system of politics. He calls U.S. president Barack Obama 'Israel's b**ch' in one of Instagram post on his page. Another picture on Besim's Instagram account expresses his thoughts on the democratic system of politics.

The hashtag on the post reads: 'Don't Vote 4 Man Made Law.' His Instagram account also revealed Besim had his Facebook account disabled. . The father of the boy also said his family had been traumatised by the dramatic raids. The father said he had a gun held to his head for 30 minutes, and police told him: 'One more word I kill you.

    "document": "A mother says she must quit her job after her daughter was refused a place at a junior school 150 yards from their front door - and sent to one more than two miles away instead. Seven-year-old Charlotte Briggs was told she cannot attend Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield even though she can see it from her bedroom window. . Her mother Lynne, 49, who has two other children, claims taking her daughter to school and back every day would require four hours of travelling on the bus and force her to quit her job. Unhappy: Charlotte Briggs, seven, was refused a place at a school 150 yards from her home and offered one two miles away, so her mother Lynne, pictured together,  must quit her job to ensure she gets there and back. Decision: The schoolgirl leaves across the street from her preferred school but instead will have to head to Shooters Grove Primary, which is around two miles away. Mrs Briggs had believed Broomhill Infants School in Sheffield, where Charlotte is a student, was a feeder school to Lydgate Junior, so only put one school on Charlotte's admission form. The mother - who works in IT for Sheffield City Council and is married to financial planner Simon, 55, - also believed the short distance from her home to the school would also be a deciding factor. But the council said the school Charlotte attends has never been a feeder school and advised parents to always submit three preferences when applying. Charlotte is in the catchment area but the school is oversubscribed, so children who also live in the area but go to the correct feeder school were given a place above her. Mrs Briggs is now planning to appeal the decision made by the authority after Charlotte was given a spot at Shooters Grove Primary - more than two miles away. She said: 'I know that lots of parents are in similar positions but what is different here is that not only are we in catchment, we live about as close to the school as possible. . Rejected: Charlotte Briggs was refused a place at Lydgate Junior School (above) in Sheffield, even though she can see it from her bedroom window. 'Parents park outside our house when dropping their children off at Lydgate Juniors. 'The council uses an \"as the crow flies\" criteria for working out who lives nearer in the event of over subscription within catchment and if I look out of my landing window, all that stands between us and the school are the Kings Court OAP flats and a couple of houses. 'I've been told Broomhill is no longer a feeder school and all the places have been allocated at other infant schools. 'I have looked at bus timetables. I wouldn't be able to drop Charlotte off at school and get into town for work. It would take an hour and five minutes each way twice a day. I simply wouldn't be able to do it.' Jayne Ludlam, the council's executive director of children, young people and families said: 'We do understand that it is difficult if a child cannot be offered a place at their preferred school. . 'We always encourage parents to submit three preferences in case their first preference cannot be accommodated. . Alternative: The seven-year-old was instead offered a place at Shooters Grove - more than two miles away. 'Broomhill Infant School is not and has never been a linked feeder school to Lydgate Junior School and a member of the Admissions Team attended Broomhill in October 2014 to offer help and advice to parents before applying. 'If only one preference is submitted and cannot be accommodated, a place may have to be offered at the nearest school with available places. This may be a school outside the catchment area, if no other preferences were requested. 'If a family has specific reasons for seeking a place at an oversubscribed school they can submit an appeal to the independent appeals panel, which will convene in June and July.' Mrs Briggs said she has contacted her local prospective parliamentary candidates in Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's constituency of Sheffield Hallam - but has yet to receive a reply. . She added: ‘The school she has been allocated is down into one valley and down the other side. It's ridiculous. If we were to go by bus it would be a bus into town and then another one out. ‘It would take an hour and five minutes to get to school. We are appealing the decision but we won't find out until July what the outcome is, which is very late for us to plan and buy uniforms.’.",

    "document": "A paramedic who pretended he was gay to get close to women before sexually assaulting them has been struck off the medical register. Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. . Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. . His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. . She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. . Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. . 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges. 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.'  . When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'",
    "claim": "Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions. He was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes.",

    "document": "Shay Given has revealed the pain still lingers from Ruud Gullit’s decision to snub him for the 1999 FA Cup final between Newcastle and Manchester United. The Republic of Ireland goalkeeper played every round of Newcastle’s run but was dropped in favour of Steve Harper for the Wembley showpiece, won 2-0 by Sir Alex Ferguson’s side. Given has yet to experience a truly fulfilling visit to the national stadium. He played in the 1998 FA Cup final loss to Arsenal, as well as the semi-final defeat to Chelsea in 2000. Shay Given will start for Aston Villa against Liverpool in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . He has an FA Cup winners’ medal from 2011 but was an unusued substitute for the final against Stoke with Joe Hart in net. He is out to make amends against Liverpool. ‘It was nice to be part of winning it with Man City but when you don’t play it doesn’t have the same value,’ he said. ‘I don’t know where my medal is to be honest. ‘1999 was a bit of a slap in the face. Do you ever get over it, I suppose? It’s not an easy one. Ruud Gullit didn’t even tell me, he got the goalkeeping coach Terry Gennoe to tell me I wasn’t playing. ‘But you can’t look back in football, you’ve just got to look forward. I’d love to win a trophy and make a bit of history at Aston Villa.’. The 38-year-old has played in all four of Villa's FA Cup matches this season and has kept two clean-sheets. Villa manager Tim Sherwood confirmed Given will start on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39. Manager Tim Sherwood has confirmed Given, who turns 39 tomorrow, will keep his Cup place rather than be replaced by No 1 Brad Guzan. Given has played every round of the competition, beginning under Paul Lambert, and make key saves along the way. . Given admitted he felt matches of this magnitude had passed him by when he was out on loan at Middlesbrough last season, as Lambert jettisoned players he needed to remove off the wage bill. Last April, he was in the dugout assisting Villa’s former manager as coach when Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa were suspended. ‘I am employed by Aston Villa and I felt I could help out,’ said Given. ‘Life is too short to have grudges.’. Sherwood watched his Villa side in training as they prepare for the Sunday's crunch clash. Sherwood, his former Blackburn teammate, has provided a ‘new lease of life’. . ‘Tim is a very ambitious guy, he wants to keep the club in the Premier League and win the FA Cup. There have been occasions this season where people have seen the angry side. But ten minutes later he is putting his arm around the same player. One of his best skills is man management. He knows how to get the best out of people.’. Given has regained his place in the Ireland team and is wants to play at Euro 2016 should his country qualify. He would also like to take the goalkeeping shirt off Brad Guzan in the Premier League. He has a year left on his contract this summer and will discuss his prospects with Sherwood. ‘This run has shown I’m still capable and hopefully it gives a seed of doubt into the manager’s head as well that if he wants to mix it up in the Premier League.’ . Aston Villa defeated rivals West Brom 2-0 in the last round to book their semi-final appearance at Wembley.  .",

    "document": "An architect who arranged to meet a woman on a blind date raped her several hours later while telling her 'girls say no but they don't really mean it,' a court has heard. Adam Leheup, 34, allegedly  insisted on having sex with the 25-year-old woman despite her shouting: 'No, no.'  . Leheup met the woman on July 9, 2013 after arranging to meet on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Adam Leheup met with his alleged victim after making contact with her through the 'Let's Date App' They arranged to meet under the clock on Waterloo Station before crossing the bridge over to the Embankment where they went to Gordon's Wine Bar. . Leheup, who is a University of Greenwich graduate and technical co-ordinator on the £500m Nine Elms Point development, denies raping the woman. . Blackfriars Crown Court heard that Leheup missed his last train home to Hersham, Walton-on-Thames, so the alleged victim allowed him to come home with her to her flat in Camden during the early hours of July 10, 2013. He said they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. In a statement to police, the alleged victim said: 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked. He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: \"No\" a lot, but he was not listening. 'I was saying: \"No\", but he thought it was a joke or something. Then maybe he realised I was serious and he calmed down. 'He said: \"Girl’s say: No, but they don’t mean it.\" I just wanted him out. My flatmate said she was going to call the police, but he laughed at her and said it would just be a domestic.' Prosecutor Mr Ish Sheikh told the court the couple met on dating app ‘Let’s Date’ - which connects users who mutually find each other attractive - and had two bottles of wine at Gordons Wine Bar, Embankment after meeting and walking across Waterloo Bridge. It was so late Leheup had missed his last train and his date agreed to put him up for the night. 'She made it clear nothing would happen and they went to a second bar, \"Joe’s\", in Camden where they had mojitos. Leheup went to Gordon's Wine Bar, pictured, with his alleged victim before going back to Camden together. Leheup has pleaded not guilty to raping the 25-year-old girl at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured. 'He started kissing my neck and it made me a bit uncomfortable, but it wasn’t vicious or nasty and later I did kiss him back. We were getting on well,' the woman told police in a video interview. 'The kissing had got a bit more aggressive, stuff I did not like, his hand on my throat, which makes me vulnerable. 'I said: \"Nothing is going to happen.\" I’m not that kind of girl. Mr Sheikh added: 'The defendant was also a bit funny towards her when she was talking to other men at the bar.' They returned to the complainant’s flat in the early hours. 'She shares it with two others and when they got into the bedroom she changed into jogging bottoms and a top and got into bed, where the defendant joined her without any clothes on at all. 'He started kissing her and got on top of her and she was shouting: \"No, no,\" and to stop, but he did not take any heed of these cries and touched her with his fingers.' Partial intercourse occurred for a very short time and the young woman managed to get away and told Leheup: 'Why did you do that when I said no?' Mr Sheikh explained: 'One of the flatmates was woken because of the shouting and told Mr Leheup to leave, but he wouldn’t because he said he had work the next day and wanted to wait until the trains started running. The flatmate threatened to call the police and Leheup clambered down scaffolding outside the balcony door, but was arrested on the way to the underground station. When questioned by police the defendant said his date did not object to being touched intimately by him. 'He said he was fondling her breasts and there was no talk of sex one way or the other. 'When they arrived at the bedroom he said she said words to the effect of: \"Welcome to my crack den.\" 'He said he took her bra off because she wanted a back massage with some oil and they began kissing. 'He said he got on top of her her and she then freaked out and as soon as she did he got off her,' explained Mr. Sheikh. 'He said he climbed down the scaffolding to avoid a confrontation. 'When she was shouting: \"No\" he should have known she was not consenting. He was not going to take no for an answer that night.' The young woman admits she was under the influence of alcohol. 'I was probably more drunk than I should have been. I was feeling a bit giddy, a bit tipsy, but I was not falling over.' The trial continues.  .

But attempting to recreate these amazing pictures is now much more difficult - and in some cases impossible - as a result of a clampdown on the use of drones for photographic purposes. New Zealand photographer Amos Chapple travelled the world during the 18 months with a quadcopter in his backpack between 2012 and 2014 when it was easier to take aerial pictures using a drone. Since then restrictive laws and regulations have been implemented across the world, due to privacy concerns, commercial rights and worries about damage to property or crashes in the air with other aircraft. . From capturing the street scene in Barcelona to the majestic glory of the Taj Mahel, his photographs of some of the world’s most far-flung and enchanting places could become ‘one of a kind’ as he re-posted them under a new blog post: 'My Aerial Drone Shots Would Be Totally Illegal Today'. ‘There was a window of about 18 months where it was possible to fly these things anywhere and people were excited to see it’, Mr Chapple told Business Insider. ‘I’m glad I made use of that time.’. Scroll down for video . The Lotus Temple in Delhi, India. The photograph was taken using a camera mounted on a quadcopter drone - offering a whole new perspective on the incredible building. The structure is the centre of the Bahai'i faith in Delhi and was designed by an Iranian exile. Mr Chapple visited India with his drone to take this stunning picture of the Taj Mahal.

The windswept Liberty Statue overlooking Budapest, Hungary. Chapple used a camera strapped to a quadcopter to capture the image. High above Barcelona, clouds while through the pillars of Sagrat Cor Church. The authorities in charge of sites and cities like that have introduced tough new regulations to stop similar pictures being taken in the future, over privacy concerns and commercial rights. Mr Chapple travelled across Europe on his photographic mission, visiting the star fort at Bourtange, Netherlands, for these pictures. The Sultan Ahmed Mosque - or the 'Blue Mosque' - in Istanbul, Turkey is seen against a much wider backdrop thanks to this birds-eye view. The aerial view of Barcelona showcase the octagonial city blocks, designed to allow light and space on the street corners. Chapple captured a 'unique' perspective of a barge chugging along the Magdeburg Water Bridge, passing over the Elbe river in Germany. Russian holidaymakers might not have spotted they were being photographed as they lay on a beech in Abkhazia - and privacy is one of the reasons authorities across the world have clamped down on the use of drone photography within their borders.

    "document": "Team Sky's Geraint Thomas had to settle for 14th place in an incident-packed Tour of Flanders as Norwegian Alexander Kristoff took victory in a sprint finish with Holland's Niki Terpstra. With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff. Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014. .  .",

According to one well-placed source, Kate's real due date is today or tomorrow - which would tie in with comments made by the Duchess herself. Speaking during an engagement in London last month, she said that her second child is due 'mid to late April'. Scroll down for video . Due today? The Duchess of Cambridge revealed her baby is due 'mid to late April' during a visit last month. Kate, 33, who was touring the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford with Prince William, added: 'Not long to go now.' Although April 25 is widely thought to be the Duchess' due date, royal sources point out that it has never been officially confirmed as such. 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date,' a Kensington Palace source told MailOnline. 'The Duchess herself said mid to late April and there have been plenty of dates bandied around in the media but we've never confirmed anything and we never will.' However, the 25th remains a favourite with punters according to bookmakers Ladbrokes, although tomorrow and Friday are also popular and are priced at just 6/1. The Duchess is currently thought to be staying at Kensington Palace, a short drive from the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital where she is due to give birth. Popular: The 25th is the favourite but the Palace says neither that date or any other has been confirmed. Preparations: The police were seen making final checks ahead of the birth outside the Lindo Wing yesterday. Yesterday, police could be seen searching the area in preparation for the Duchess' arrival and were seen peering under traffic cones and taking lamp posts apart. According to a statement released by Kensington Palace the same day, the new baby's father, Prince William, has  finished his Air Ambulance training early and will now avoid the two-hour dash from Norfolk that some had predicted. 'The Duke of Cambridge has completed the first phase of his in-work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with Bond Air Services earlier than anticipated,' the statement read. 'This is due to a combination of The Duke performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned. 'As he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave, he will not return to duties with Bond until that time, and will remain on unpaid leave until then.' Fans: Royal fans have also set up camp outside the hospital, among them Terry Hut, 71. Ready to go: The scenes outside the hospital are reminiscent of those seen for Prince George in 2013. Back in town: The Palace has said Prince Harry will be in London this weekend before returning to Australia. But concerns have been raised about the possibility of the royal birth clashing with official events to mark the centenary of the Dardanelles campaign, with Prince William due to attend a wreath-laying service at the Cenotaph on Saturday. The ceremony, which is also being held to mark ANZAC Day, will be mirrored by another taking place in Turkey which is due to be attended by the Prince of Wales and Prince Harry. Kensington Palace have also said that rather than return directly to Australia, where he is currently taking part in training exercises with the Australian Defence Force, Harry will briefly travel back to London instead. Harry will attend Sunday's London Marathon, which, according to Palace sources, is a long-standing commitment but one that could  be confirmed only after  his Australian army schedule had been firmed up. .  .",

'Bastian and Franck will not be with us against Porto. That is bitter,' sports director Matthias Sammer said on Monday as the problems started to pile up for the treble-chasing Bavarians.

    "document": "One hundred and forty-seven victims. Many more families affected. Even more broken hopes and dreams. As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official. The father of suspect Abdirahim Abdullahi is a chief in Mandera and had reported his son missing, officials said. The Islamist extremist group is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the nation that shares a border with Kenya. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, killing nearly 70 people.",

    "document": "The mighty boot of Marcelo Bosch kept the English flag flying in Europe as the Argentinian kicked Saracens through to the Champions Cup semi-finals with a famous last-minute penalty. No chorus of boos or whistles would stop the sweet strike rising above the 1950s tower blocks in the Colombes suburbs, with the ice cool 31-year-old mobbed by players and coaches as Racing Metro 92 were unceremoniously dumped out of the competition. It was the South American’s finest moment since he arrived on continental shores. Referee Nigel Owens was escorted off the pitch by security but his call –penalising replacement lock Fabrice Metz with 10 seconds left on the clock – was the correct decision and ensured a classic finale to match bereft or flair and finesse. . Scenes of elation as Saracens clinch victory with the last play of the match against Racing Metro 92. Marcelo Bosch kicks the match-winning penalty from long-range to snatch Saracen's a semi-final berth. Argentine Bosch raises his arms aloft after being entrusted with the final kick of the game . Bosch jumps into the arms of Rhys Gills after his successful kick as Hodgson joins the celebrations. Bosch is mobbed by his elated Sarries team-mates after his kick sails over the posts for the win. England's first team through to the semi-finals in the European Rugby Champions Cup semis celebrate.  . RACING METRO 92: Dulin, Imhoff, Chavancy, Roberts, Thomas, Sexton, Machenaud, Ben Arous, Szarzewski, Ducalcon, Charteris, Van Der Merwe, Lauret, Gerondeau, Claassen. Replacements: Lacombe, Brugnaut, Mujati, Metz, Dubarry, Phillips, Goosen, Dumoulin. Tries: Machenaud Penalties: Machenaud (2) Conversions: Nil . Referee: Nigel Owens (Wales) .

Replacements: Brits, Barrington, Johnston, Itoje, Brown, Hankin, De Kock, Tompkins. Tries: Nil Penalties: Hodgson (2), Goode, Bosch Conversions: Nil . ‘The last time I kicked to win the game was when I was 21 and playing for an amateur club in Argentina,’ said Bosch. 'It was from more or less the same range and it was against our clasico rivals. It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. ‘I tried to be as relaxed as possible. We had the wind in our face and I didn’t want to force it. I tried not to think about what it represented and I said, “Why not? I can take it.” The rest is history. With kicks like this, you’re either the hero or the bad guy - I’m happy that it went my way.’. It was the sort of strike that was associated with Ronan O’Gara during his illustrious playing career with Munster and Ireland. The retired No 10, now kicking coach for the Top 14 side, watched helplessly from the stands of the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir as the ball sailed between the posts to set up a knockout meeting with Clermont in Saint Etienne. .

They would drink champagne at half time but this was an abrasive and at times unabsorbing encounter, offering little to inspire the Parisian painters couched on the sidelines to capture the moments of magic. The partisan home crowd were angered by two of Owens’ decisions in the opening quarter, with the Welshman not penalising Alex Goode for a block on French winger Teddy Thomas and scratching off a potential try for Dimitri Szarzewski because of a knock on. Charlie Hodgson kicked two first-half penalties – either side of a 27th minute try for Maxime Machenaud after Saracens lost an attacking scrum - Jim Hamilton was shown a yellow card, the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one-point advantage. ‘We weren't great in the first half, even though we had a very strong wind,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We were unable to build any pressure. Playing into that very strong wind and with Jonny Sexton playing No 10 for the opposition, being 6-5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb.  . Marcelo Bosch is an Argentine utility back who moved to Europe in 2006 to play for Biarritz. He joined Saracens in the 2013-14 season and has featured predominantly at centre. He is not Saracens’ first-choice kicker - Owen Farrell, Charlie Hodgson and Alex Goode are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike. It’s earned him cult status with the Allianz Park crowd, who chant ‘Bosch, Bosch, Bosch’ whenever he lines up one of his kicks. As a teenager, Bosch played football in Buenos Aires but claims that it was always his dream to play rugby in England. He married Augustina last summer and they are expecting twins. . Bosch's football skills aid his powerful kicking. Racing Metro 92 winger Teddy Thomas shows his speed to avoid Chris Wyles and escape the in-goal area. Sarries' stand-in captain Hodgson places his grubber kick underneath Wenceslas Lauret. Racing Metro and Ireland fly-half Jonny Sexton (left) locks horns with Sarries winger David Strettle. Strettle is upended going for a high ball against Racing's Brice Dulin, who escapes a yellow card . ‘But that's where it turned around and I'd say our second half performance was as courageous, brave and hard working as I've seen. We went hunting and kept knocking them down, scrapping for absolutely everything. Our rugby could have been better and it wasn't a beauty of a match, but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance.’. Cigarette smoke filled the air and, having never previously progressed from the pool stages, the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure. Racing did most of the running but Saracens edged further ahead, with Goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty. Wales and Racing centre Jamie Roberts threatened in attack, but was hauled off in the 52nd minute. Bosch then tackled his countryman Juan Imhoff just short of the line – although the pitch-length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass – and Billy Vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a Racing attack. But Saracens were unable to build upon their lead and, just past the hour mark, Racing narrowed the gap thanks to three points from Machenaud. A game of kick tennis ensued and the French No 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later. The blue and white flags were waving and the bass drum was beating but, sacrebleu, Metro tried to run down the clock. Then Metz came flying off his feet at the crucial moment. Bosch stepped up for the penalty and, after a short run up, his kick floated gracefully between the sticks. .

Jordan Meikle stretches his muscles in front of the spectator's barriers at the London Marathon. Biding his time while masking the slight smirk on his face, Jordan lunges into another stretch – one that has him facing his girlfriend on one knee – and reveals the ring box from behind his back.

    "document": "The new Southpaw trailer last month featured Jake Gyllenhaal showing off an extremely toned torso. . But according to his trainer, former professional boxer Terry Claybon, it took a huge amount of work to get the 34-year-old actor ripped for the shoot, including six months of training before filming even started.  . He also worked out for an incredible six hours per day, including 2,000 sit ups, 1,000 each morning and the same at night. . Of course, Jake had to work even harder to get in shape because he had just  dropped approximately 30lbs to play freelance crime reporter Lou, who stumbles upon the dangerous underworld of Los Angeles in Nightcrawler. Scroll down for video . Blood, sweat and tears: According to his trainer, it took a huge amount of work to get Jake Gyllenhaal ripped for Southpaw, including six months of training before filming started, 2,000 sit ups and six hours of training each day. Much thinner: The 34-year-old lost 30 pounds for 2014 thriller Nightcrawler and had  to put that weight  back on plus 15lbs of muscle . He not only returned to his normal weight - but he then put on another 15 pounds of pure muscle to play the desperate fighter Billy Hope. His trainer Claybon told Yahoo: 'Gradually we built up, day-by-day, to 2,000. It takes time to do that', and revealed that his exercise regime included, 'three hours of boxing in the morning and three hours of strengthening, conditioning, and cardio at night.' . Speaking about his weight loss for Nightcrawler, Jake told Us Weekly: 'I knew that [Lou] was literally and figuratively hungry, [so I got into the] mode where I was always a bit hungry. Beaten: The trailer shows a muscular Gyllenhaal bloodied and bruised by an opponent in the boxing ring. Bulking up: Jake poses here with his trainers, including former boxer Terry Claybon (second from right), who was responsible for whipping the once-scrawny actor into shape. Gyllenhaal also attended several boxing matches to watch how real fighters move in the ring. 'It's not different than getting into character for anything. It's more about believing where you are and being present where you are. Who's to say what the process is? I have a strange one … but I love what I do.' . Claybon explained to Yahoo that Jake put back on the weight he had lost before gaining an extra 15 pounds of muscle for Southpaw. . Health experts told the Daily Telegraph that Gyllenhaal likely went on a high-protein diet, that likely included protein powder. He likely had to consume 130 grams of protein - two and a half times the daily recommended intake. . Health experts also told the Telegraph that such drastic body changes could cause long-term damage to his body. . The huge swing in Gyllenhaal's physique recalls other drastic changes actors have made in their bodies. Among the most recent and most notable is Matthew McConaughey's turn from  Magic Mike hunk to Dallas Buyers Club AIDS patient. Meanwhile, in Southpaw, Jake plays Billy Hope, a professional boxer who must rebuild his life after his wife is killed and his daughter is taken away from him. . The recent trailer opens with Gyllenhaal's understatement: 'I expected a hard fight. I put my family through a lot.' It then cuts to him in the ring bloodied and bruised as he takes a relentless pounding from an opponent, while his wife, played by Rachel McAdam and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson look on in horror, before Hope suddenly turns it around sends the other boxer to the canvass. Horrified: His wife, played by Rachel McAdam and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson can only stand by and watch ringside. Adrenelin: Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope, a boxer who allows himself take punches to fire himself up. The reason Gyllenhaal's character allowed himself to take the beating in the first place is then explained. 'The more you get hit the harder you fight, I get it,' his wife says. 'Only now you've taken way to many hits before you get off. You cant fight like that any more. Think about her.' She's talking about the couple's only daughter Leila, who is played by film newcomer Oona Laurence. The youngster is fresh from lauded performances on Broadway as Matilda in the stage adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic. But the trailer also reveals there's a much more devastating blow in store for Hope, when his wife is accidentally shot dead by a bodyguard during an altercation with he has with another boxer who had been taunting him, which McAdam's character had told him to walk away from.

    "document": "Made famous by their 'matchy matchy' style and twin-like looks (despite the five year age difference), the Melbourne based fashion duo Jess, 22, and Stef, 27, Dadon are now set to take their crazy style collaborations to a new level. The sisters have teamed up with 'Print All Over Me' - an innovative online New York-based company that allows you to digitally design your own prints - and Buffalo shoes, the brand behind the Spice Girls' trademark platforms. Introduced to the company via a mutual friend in the U.S., the girls knew it was a match made in heaven. 'We both have a love of colour and prints and so we said lets do something crazy together,' says Stef. Scroll down for video . Quirky collab: Sister duo Jess and Stef Dadon have teamed up  with  New York company ' Print All Over Me' Cocktails and creativity: The sisters are heading to LA soon for summer to launch new shoe line 'Twoobs' The photo-shoot was their own idea, which according to Jess they 'threw together' because they didn't think the collaboration on its own had enough of their signature look that is all about over-the -top colours and accessories. While the duo look posed and polished in the pics, they let us in on a little secret, according to the 'How Two Live' girls, they insist they don't actually like modelling, despite the 1732 posts on Instagram that would suggest otherwise. 'We don’t like to model, so we decided to add wigs and sunnies so we can hide behind them and they don’t see us,' says Jess. Candy coloured palettes: Stef, 27 (left) and Jess, 22 (right) Dadon have over 111,000 followers on Instagram. Steph says they use the term 'modelling' loosely as they don't see themselves as professional models, they just happen to be in the photos showcasing the clothes. . The photo shoot which took place in Sydney's Luna Park provided the perfect backdrop for the crazy, clown-like antics of the collaboration. 'They closed the park for the day so we had a couple of hours to take over and shoot. It provided the perfect creepy abandoned backdrop.' Model shy:The girls admit while they love wearing clothes, they are actually camera shy. Theme this: Sydney's theme park 'Luna Park' was the backdrop for their crazy colour pop collaboration. The shoes featured are also as part of the collaboration and are from the brand 'Buffalo Shoes' which are the same brand who sky-rocketed platforms into the mainstream  when they were famously worn by the Spice Girls during the 90s. 'We'd been collaborating with the guys from Buffalo shoes but we weren't sure what our following would think, so we posted a pic on Instagram and everyone has been dying over them - so it's had a great response,' says Jess. . While the  photo shoot for their current collaboration only took a quick 45 minutes, the Dadon sisters had a lot of other projects  keeping them busy. Down-to-earth duo:  45 minutes is all it took to string together the glamour shots as seen throughout. Pop princesses: The platforms  made by Buffalo Shoes are the same company made famous by the Spice Girls. First there's their new shoe label, titled 'Twoobs,' coming out in  June in America. 'We  did a shoe collaboration with Windsor Smith a year and a half ago and once we got a taste for shoes we fell in love,' says Jess. 'This first line will be all about sandals with  flat and platform soles,'she said. According to Jess,  platforms are a must because they're much more comfortable than heels - 'you’re feet won't be sore at the end of the night and you still get the height.' Flair for fashion: With a natural knack for fashion the girls are now releasing a 'how-to' book titled #howtolive. Colour craziness: 'How To Live' have become well known thanks to their colourful Australian style. Questioned why America is their first market, the sisters admit escaping to summer weather is their biggest appeal, especially as their based most of the year in Melbourne (known for it's southerly chill). 'We’re going to go for three months then decide if we'll stay on permanently. We love L.A., and we already have a fan base and  connections to the shoe industry over there so it just made sense,' says Stef. They also have a book in the works, with the very insta-worthy title ' #howtwolive' coming out in September. . Celebrity scene: In their short two and a half years of blogging they've met  Rachel Zoe and Anna Dello Russo. The book offers 36 'how-two' projects including fashion, recipes and nail art ideas. As for more collaborations? There's more on the cards but according to the girls it's still under tight wraps at the moment. Not that the fashion bloggers will need any help with exposure. The duo have met a lot of fashion royalty in the two and a half years since their blog's conception - with highlights including   Rachel Zoe at New York Fashion Week and  Anna Dello Russo when they guest edited for Elle Girl Japan. Fame and fortune aside, at the end of the day all the girls really care about is representing fashion. 'In the Australian blogging scene, everyone does the same thing, so we decided early on our goal was to bring colour into the Australian market,' says Jess. Patriotic pair: Despite business endeavours in the U.S. they take pride in representing Australian designers. And it's their vibrant and uniquely Australian approach that seems to be working. 'When we met Rachel Zoe we were wearing an amazing Australian designer Natasha Fagg and she came up to us and was like ‘\"I love what you’re wearing, you girls look so crazy,\"' says Jess. . 'It also helps that we were wearing big sunnies, very Rachel Zoe, she adds. 'We love to promote Australian designers when we're overseas. When we guest edited Elle Girl, it was so cool to have people from Japan come up and ask us who we were wearing,' she said. Despite their recent success, the duo from Melbourne remain down-to-earth about their life and even admit that despite receiving the odd gifts here and there they prefer to buy all their own clothes. 'It's flattering to receive gifts but we're a bit picky and it's always better to buy what you love and stay true to what your style is,' says Jess. .",

Co-star John Stamos announced Monday night on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" that Netflix has ordered up a reunion special, followed by a spinoff series called \"Fuller House.\" The show will feature Candace Cameron Bure, who played eldest daughter D.J. Tanner in the original series -- which aired from 1987 to 1995 -- as the recently widowed mother of three boys. \"It's sort of a role reversal, and we turn the house over to her,\" Stamos told Kimmel. Jodie Sweetin, who played Stephanie Tanner in the original series, and Andrea Barber, who portrayed D.J.'s best friend Kimmy Gibbler, will both return for the new series, Netflix said. Stamos will produce and guest star. Talks with co-starsBob Saget, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Dave Coulier and Lori Loughlin are ongoing, Netflix said. The show will be available next year, Netflix said. \"As big fans of the original Full House, we are thrilled to be able to introduce Fuller House's new narrative to existing fans worldwide, who grew up on the original, as well as a new generation of global viewers that have grown up with the Tanners in syndication,\"  Netflix Vice President of Original Content Cindy Holland said in a statement. The show starts with Tanner -- now named Tanner-Fuller (get it ... Fuller?) -- pregnant, recently widowed and living in San Francisco. Her younger sister Stephanie -- now an aspiring musician -- and her lifelong best friend and fellow single mom, Kimmy, move in to help her care for her two boys and the new baby. On Monday, Barber tweeted Cameron Bure to ask whether she was ready to resume their onscreen friendship. \"We never stopped,\" Cameron Bure tweeted back. Fans were over the moon at the news.",

    "document": "Wayne Rooney knows Champions League qualification is Manchester United's to lose, making this weekend's clash with Aston Villa all the more important. Louis van Gaal's side sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings as the season enters the closing stages, boasting a five-point cushion over the chasing pack after winning so impressively at Liverpool before the international break. Juan Mata's brace earned United a deserved 2-1 triumph at Anfield to give them a buffer over the Reds, as well as fellow top-four contenders Southampton and Tottenham. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney feels the club are on course to qualify for the Champions League. United midfielder Juan Mata scored a fantastic brace against Liverpool to secure his side a 2-1 win at Anfield. The second of Mata's goals was a brilliant improvised scissor kick to give United a 2-0 lead in the second-half. However, Rooney is well aware how quickly things can change, admitting nothing less than victory will suffice when Aston Villa come to Aston Villa on Saturday. 'Yes it was (a six-pointer at Liverpool), but that means nothing if we don't beat Aston Villa on Saturday,' the United captain said. 'Obviously Arsenal play Liverpool as well, so if we can get the win against Villa that will be an even better result than Liverpool was for us. 'I think there are still eight games left. We are in a good position at the minute so it's in our own hands, so have to make sure we do it.' Rooney and several of his United team-mates only returned home from international duty on Wednesday afternoon after a technical fault on the England team plane delayed their departure from Turin. It meant an extra night in Italy, where it looked like they would be leaving after a night to forget as Graziano Pelle punished the Three Lions' poor first-half display. However, Andros Townsend's wonder strike saw England secure a 1-1 draw following a much-improved performance after half-time, when Roy Hodgson's bold substitutions paid off - as did his decision to partner Rooney with full debutant Harry Kane. The England skipper had spent the first half in midfield role as Hodgson tinkered with his side, although he is not allowing that experimentation to be an excuse. 'I think it's important in tournament football you might need that, so that's what we were doing,' the 29-year-old said. Rooney competes for the ball with Italy defender Andrea Ranocchia during Tuesday's international friendly . Rooney runs forward with the ball during the friendly match at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on Tuesday. 'We were trying a few different things out because you never know with injuries and suspensions in tournament football. The best time to do it is obviously in the friendlies. 'You could clearly see in the first half that it didn't work so I think the manager made good changes at the right time which helped us to get back into the game. 'Obviously I haven't played in midfield for a few weeks. Sometimes it is difficult to go from up front to midfield or from midfield to up front - sometimes it does take time. 'I had a few chances and could have scored, so I felt I played better when I went up front.' United team-mate Phil Jones was another to struggle away from his preferred position, looking lost at times at the base of the diamond. He looked more assured when he dropped back into defence after Chris Smalling complained of feeling unwell and was replaced by Michael Carrick late in the opening period. The 33-year-old had not played for England since October 2013 before these matches and Rooney loves having his club-mate around. 'I felt Michael Carrick was the best player on the pitch by a mile,' he said. 'He gave us great composure, he slowed the game down when we needed to and started our attacks really well.' Asked if Carrick has been under-rated throughout his career, Rooney said: 'Not from me and certainly not from Manchester United fans. 'I think he is a fantastic player. He has been a big reason why, at United, we have won so many trophies over the last few years. So from myself and his team-mates, he has not been under-estimated.' United and England midfielder Michael Carrick has been singled out for his strong performance against Italy.  .",

    "document": "A morbidly obese man who piled on the pounds thanks to a twice-daily takeaway habit and 'hated leaving the house' because of his looks has lost 19st in just one year. David Rush, 33, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, felt that he 'shouldn't go out' because of his size but lost the weight after plucking up the courage to start cycling. At his heaviest, he weighed 34st and was forced to order specialist XXXXXL clothes on the internet - the result of topping up his takeaway-heavy diet with six bags of crisps and two bottles of full-fat Coca-Cola a day. Shedding the pounds: David Rush, 33, used to weigh 34st but has shed an incredible 19st in just one year. Super slimmer: Mr Rush now weighs a slimline 15st 4lbs - down from 34st at his heaviest (right) . Embarrassed by his size and afraid of cruel comments or being forced to squeeze past people, Mr Rush says he never left the house - and never had a girlfriend. 'I hated leaving the house and going out anywhere because I didn't know if the places I would be going to were tight for space,' he explains. 'I was that big it made me feel like I shouldn't be out. My eating was awful - I would have takeaways every night for my dinner and eat junk all through the day.' But when his weight began to prevent him from walking easily, he decided to take action and ditched the takeaways in favour of a healthy meal plan. Mr Rush, who now weighs a healthy 15st 4lbs, began shedding the pounds at the rate of a stone a week but, determined to speed up the process, took up cycling. . Overindulging: Mr Rush's old diet consisted of twice-daily takeaways topped up with six bags of crisps . Mobility: He plucked up the courage to make a change after having problems walking around . He combined bike rides with 10 mile jogs and vigorous gym workouts and as a result, managed to shed a substantial 18st 10lb in just one year. A newly slimline Mr Rush says he now feels confident enough to ask women on dates and is training for a half-marathon and a 115-mile charity bike ride.  . 'Since my weight loss my life has changed so much,' he enthuses. 'I started off with walking but once I started to cycle the weight just came off and I was able to join the gym. 'I've got my social life back, I'm out with my friends and I've got myself a new small car I can fit into.' Mr Rush says he has always been big but really began piling on the pounds in his twenties after moving out of his parents' home. Unhealthy habits swiftly crept in, with Mr Rush frequently eating crisps for breakfast and takeaways for lunch and dinner. . Shrunk: Mr Rush and a friend can both squeeze into his old XXXXXL Rangers football shirt. New lease of life: Mr Rush is now training for a half-marathon and a 115-mile bike ride . Breakfast - Couple of bags of crisps. Lunch - Sausage supper from the chip shop. Dinner - Takeaway curry. Snacks - Five more bags of crisps and huge bottles of coke. Breakfast - Porridge or natural yoghurt with branflakes and fruit. Lunch - Cous cous with chicken breast and vegetables. Dinner - Fruit and yoghurt. Snacks - Fibre bars or fruit. Enjoying himself: Mr Rush, in the red jacket on the left, cycles up to 85 miles a week . All that changed when his mother Margaret began suffering from heart problems, which, combined with Mr Rush' own mobility issues, provided the wake-up call he needed. . Determined to beat the bulge, he joined Slimming World and gave his diet a makeover, eating healthy porridge for breakfast and snacking on fruit and yoghurt. . Mr Rush, who works in a storage unit facility, is now saving up for cosmetic surgery because he still has more than a stone of excess skin that he can't shift. 'It really gets me down,' he admits. 'I've lost all this weight and I'm still wearing baggy clothes cause I don't feel confident. 'It does get me down but at the same time I'm really happy with myself for what I have achieved on my own with no help. 'My life has been on such a journey this last year I feel like I'm just starting to live.' . Looking good: He now wants to complete his dramatic transformation with surgery to remove excess skin .",

Just three months after Silver himself was arrested on corruption charges, his son-in-law Marcello Trebitsch, 37, was accused of running a $7million Ponzi scheme. . The Brooklyn resident was in court on Monday as prosecutors accused him of lying to investors about stock losses and pocketing most of the money entrusted to him for trading. Trebitsch is married to Silver's daughter Michelle. Despite being a co-owner of their mutual fund, Allese Capital LLC, and a certified public accountant who 'kept the books', Michelle has not been charged in the scheme. . The son-in-law of Sheldon Silver was charged Monday with allegedly running a $7million Ponzi scheme. Silver, the former Speaker of the New York State Assembly, was charged in January for allegedly taking $4million in brides and kickbacks since 200. Silver pictured above entering court for his arraignment on February 24. The criminal complaint was filed by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bhahara, the same prosecutor who led the investigation into Silver's alleged corruption.  But sources told the New York Daily News that the investigations are unrelated. 'Investing in securities entails certain risks, but should not include the risk of being defrauded by one’s investment manager,' Bhahara said. . According to the complaint, Trebitsch took millions from investors, promising to invest their money in large-cap stocks through his mutual fund. . However, prosecutors say he only invested a fraction of the money and used the rest to finance his family and pay back other clients. Meanwhile, he allegedly lied to investors about what money he did invest, sending them fake account statements and tax forms that showed them posting positive returns along the lines of his promised 14 to 16 per cent - keeping 'enormous trading losses' secret. Trebitsch ran the scheme from 2009 through December 2014, according to the complaint. . Trebitsch has been charged with securities and wire fraud and is currently free on $500,000 bond. If convicted he faces the possibility of 40 years in prison and fines of up to $5.25million. . Father-in-law Silver was arrested in January, on charges he took $4million in brides and kickbacks since at least 2000. .

    "document": "Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside. While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling’s interview didn’t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn’t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I’m hoping that that wasn’t the whole point, as we’ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: ‘let him go’. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money’s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers. Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract. Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It’s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there’s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £100,000-a-week contract he’s turned down. But it’s only that: potential. At present, he’s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he’s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn’t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania  . And while I’d be willing to see the club give him £100k a week – possibly £120k a week - the club shouldn’t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I’m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling’s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he’s welcome to. Personally, I don’t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United. Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club. If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he’s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we’ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he’s easily worth £25-30 million. If I was FSG, I’d hold any interested club to ransom, though – double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn’t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there’s little Arsenal can offer that we can’t. Sure, they’re more financially stable but what – in terms of trophies – do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract. I think we’re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren’t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he’s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won’t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

    "document": "It's probable that Thiago Alcantara would never have signed for Manchester United even if David Moyes had wanted him. Once Pep Guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at Bayern Munich, it was pointless for United to continue their pursuit anyway,. But the fact that Moyes wasn't keen on the transfer - 'not his type' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he wasn't the right fit for United. Not that Moyes is a bad judge of a player; all managers get it wrong at some point. However, United's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout Moyes' short time at the club. Indeed, it has continued to be a problem until Michael Carrick fully recovered from injury and Ander Herrera began to find his feet. The kind of passing display Thiago delivered in Bayern's 6-1 win over Porto on Wednesday has been precisely what United have been missing. Thiago (right) heads in Bayern Munich's first goal during their 6-1 win over Porto on Tuesday night. Thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started Bayern's remarkable comeback. Thiago is congratulated on his strike by Pep Guardiola, the man who took him from Barcelona to Bayern. Without quality in that area, few teams can compete at the elite level any more. It used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height, strength and an ability to tackle. Given that most distribution emanates from deep, being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now. Moyes might quite reasonably been worried that Thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. And his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by Spain at the World Cup after pulling out with a knee injury. But there are few players in the world who can pass like Thiago. Gary Neville has spoken about how Paul Scholes was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing. Andrea Pirlo and Xavi are two more from Scholes' generation. Thiago is now elevating himself to their level. One experienced German journalist who has been watching Bayern for 35 years commented last night: 'Thiago might well be the most technically-gifted central midfielder who has ever played for Bayern.' . Thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for Bayern Munich as they crushed Porto. Thiago started his career at Barcelona but was overlooked for Cesc Fabregas (right) by boss Tito Vilanova. And no-one has invested more in Thiago than Guardiola, which is why United had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made. It was Pep who promoted him to the first team at Barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad. But when Pep left, his successor, the late Tito Vilanova, wanted Cesc Fabregas to play that role. Thiago was sidelined, hence his availability in the summer of 2013. He is very much a global footballer for the 21st century. His dad, of course, is Brazilian, the World Cup winner Mazinho; Thiago was born in Italy and raised in Spain. He opted to play for the country in which he was living, rather than that of his forefathers or his birth, and was outstanding for Spain in the European Under 21 championships in 2013, scoring a hat-trick in the final against Italy in a 4-2 win. At Barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of Thiago. Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets have that position covered. But Xavi is off to Qatar and Cesc is at Chelsea. Should Barca end up against Bayern in the Champions League semi finals, they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements. David Moyes believed Thiago may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League.  .",

In an interview with the Evening Standard, the  model admitted that the most surprising thing in her handbag is the tester kit, which she uses to check her state of alkaline. Scroll down for video . Elle Macpherson, who turned 51 last month, has revealed that she carries around a pH balance urine tester kit wherever she goes to check the state of her body. Elle said: '(The most surprising thing in my handbag is) a pH balance urine tester kit to check that I'm in an alkaline state. I believe that most ailments come from having an acidic body.' The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. . An alkaline body can be achieved by eating the right foods (lots of leafy greens) and exercising. Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times, and the Britain's Next Top Model host puts her figure down to 'variation' and 'consistency'. The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease.

I work out 45 minutes a day, six days a week, combining hiking, water skiing, swimming and running on a beach. '(My idea of a healthy diet is) consistency and eating three healthy meals a day. Having said that, red meat, wheat and dairy don't work for me.' Like fellow models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Elle swears by the power of all things green and she is so convinced by their potency, that she's unveiled her very own brand. . Last year, Elle introduced The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements, which she describes as her drug. She hasn't aged a day! Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle, pictured, left, in 1995 and, right, in 2012,  has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times. The product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention. The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function. Speaking to FEMAIL at the time about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle said: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good. 'For years, I was taking vitamins and powders. I tried alternative medicine, acupuncture, reflexology. 'I'm a pescatarian, I don't drink, do drugs or smoke so what else can I do? I wasn't unaware of wellness but something wasn't working for me and I told my doctor \"I don't feel great\". 'She told me my body was acidic, it was down to stress, travel and lack of sleep.' Elle has co-created The Super Elixir Nourishing Protein, which is made from locally sourced organic sprouted brown rice, pea protein chocolate and Peruvian cacao and a product that the supermodel credits for helping her get ready for beach holidays . So successful was the launch of the elixir that the duo have added another product to the range: The Super Elixir Nourishing Protein. Made from locally sourced organic sprouted brown rice, pea protein chocolate and Peruvian cacao, the £45 product is a plant based complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids like those found in red meat, eggs, chicken and fish.

Transgender Munroe has made a name for herself on London's party scene and now spins the decks in some of the country's most high end clubs. Munroe said: 'I had always known growing up that I was supposed to be a woman, but I'd always tried to hide it for fear of being different. 'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate.

'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate,' she says. Munroe (pictured at a party last year) began her transition at the age of 19, and at 25 years old was offered hormones by her doctor. 'I'm now a DJ full time and I do some work within the fashion industry too,' said Munroe. 'I've worked for Calvin Klein in their press office, designed a lip gloss for Illamasqua, a make-up brand that I love, and I've even designed capsule lines for Boy London - Rihanna has worn one of my pieces.

'It is not something that I would recommend at all, but the process can take such a long time, and once you've made the decision to become the person you really are, you just want to get on with it. 'It was really exciting to start taking the hormones and see my body change - and soon as I was given them by my doctor. 'It's like going through puberty again so I got quite self-conscious about the way I looked and dressed, and I felt as though I started to think differently.' 'I didn't really like explaining what was going on to people as I was doing this for myself, but friends and family were curious,' she said. 'My mum found out what was going on when she noticed my chest growing - it was a shock at first but she's very supportive. 'As soon as I noticed the change in myself it was like I wasn't ashamed any more,' she said. Munroe has now been taking hormones for four years, and has embraced her new life. She said: 'When I left university I got involved in fashion and the PR industry. 'I've had the opportunity of working with some incredible brands, designers and photographers, and I just love it. 'I've done everything from club promotion, modelling, PR, and now I'm a full time DJ. 'I DJ at major club nights and private members clubs in some of the most exclusive venues in London - I feel so lucky for everything that's come my way, I would never take it for granted. 'I'm still the same person I was before, I'm just in the right body now. 'I look in the mirror and I feel like it's me who's looking back, rather than somebody I don't recognise'.

    "document": "It was a real-life fairytale – the moment, 70 years ago, when two carefully guarded princesses were let loose to join the jubilant crowds in London celebrating the end of the Second World War in Europe. Now the adventure has been re-created in a new film, showing the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they wander incognito through the city streets. And among the most curious viewers of A Royal Night Out, released next month to coincide with the anniversary of VE Day on May 8, 1945, will be a woman who knows better than anyone what really happened on that extraordinary night. Scroll down for video . Royal Role: Canadian Sarah Gadon, left. plays a young Princess Elizabeth, pictured right. Dancing Queen: Sarah Gadon as Princess Elizabeth enjoying a night out to celebrate the end of the Second World War. Because she was there. ‘It was a Cinderella moment in reverse,’ says The Hon Margaret Rhodes, 89, first cousin to the Queen and her best friend. ‘It was wonderful bedlam. I can’t remember whose idea it was. It was just one of those things that happened.’. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from her home at Windsor Great Park, she says: ‘I think it’s one of the things that the Queen remembers with great happiness. Neither of them had ever done anything remotely similar, being let loose in a crowd like that to walk all the way from Buckingham Palace through to Trafalgar Square. ‘Everyone was kissing everybody and picking up hats and throwing them away. It was euphoria at its most euphoric!’. Mrs Rhodes, then young Margaret Elphinstone, was lodging at Buckingham Palace while working as a secretary for the military intelligence service MI6. She recalls how a small gang including 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, 15, and Mrs Rhodes’s brothers, left the Palace by the Privy Gate. ‘With the best will in the world, I can’t remember if Princess Elizabeth kissed anyone, but kisses were being thrown about very liberally,’ she says. ‘It was like we had all been living under a huge, heavy, dark cloud. And suddenly, it had gone. I’m so old now, I’m literally the only other person left alive who was there with them on VE Day.’. The Queen is said to remember the night with 'great happiness' In the film, which stars Canadian actress Sarah Gadon as the future Queen and British newcomer Bel Powley as Princess Margaret, the sisters are shown wearing cocktail dresses for their adventure. In real life, Princess Elizabeth was wearing her Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform. Mrs Rhodes says: ‘In order not to be recognised, the Queen pulled her cap right down over her eyes and one of the officers who was with us said, “Look, I’m not going about with an officer who can’t wear her cap properly,” so she had to put it back. Mrs Rhodes adds: ‘I always thought it was very clever of the King and Queen Elizabeth [the Queen Mother] to let the girls go out into the night, with all those myriad of people around them. They knew it was something the Queen and Princess Margaret would never forget.’. Princess Elizabeth is also shown forming a brief attachment with a young serviceman called Jack, who takes her gambling and to a Soho brothel. ‘That didn’t happen,’ laughs Mrs Rhodes, whose younger self does not feature in the film. ‘Apparently, Princess Margaret escapes on the top deck of a bus. That never happened.’. Princess Margaret is also shown quite drunk. ‘No! There was no possibility. We never encountered anyone offering one a drink,’ insists Mrs Rhodes, the daughter of the 16th Lord Elphinstone. One of the true scenes in the film is of the Royal party dancing the conga through the Ritz. ‘The smart old ladies having drinks were gobsmacked,’ says Mrs Rhodes, although it actually happened on VJ night, August 15 – when Britain celebrated Japan’s surrender. The princesses were protected on their VE Day jaunt by Captain Harold Campbell RN, equerry to Princess Elizabeth’s father, King George VI. ‘He was deeply disapproving of the whole manoeuvre,’ says Mrs Rhodes. The party returned to the Palace after midnight. ‘It was emancipation,’ says Mrs Rhodes. ‘I don’t think anybody realises what she has had to give up. You give up your independence. Poor Princess Margaret is dead, but that night is something I know the Queen will never forget.’. ...And she recorded a secret song tape . Friends: Margaret Rhodes, left with Princess Margaret and Elizabeth, right. By Michael Powell. The Queen and Princess Margaret recorded a secret tape of children’s songs as a touching gift for their mother on her 90th birthday, it has been revealed. Pianist and composer Laurie Holloway has told for the first time how his friend Princess Margaret phoned him with the idea, days before the Queen Mother’s milestone birthday in August 1990. He was summoned to Buckingham Palace and taken to an upstairs room ‘where there was a dark brown, walnut grand piano and two microphones. There was also a sound engineer who I think they had got in from the BBC’. Mr Holloway said the Queen, then 64, and Princess Margaret, then 59, wanted to sing quite unusual children’s songs. ‘One was called I Know Where The Flies Go In Winter Time,’ he said. ‘The Queen said they were taught them by their mother’s father, the Earl of Strathmore. We rehearsed them a few times and then we recorded them in one take each.’. Mr Holloway, 77, musical director on Strictly Come Dancing for its first three series, said the Royal sisters sang ‘very well, beautifully in fact’ during the two-hour recording session. ‘The Queen has a nice, sweet tone to her voice,’ he added. He said Margaret told him the Queen Mother loved the gift. ‘She said that when they gave it to her at Windsor, the Queen Mother said she didn’t have anything to play it on, so they had to go out to the car to listen to it. ‘Later, Prince Charles arrived and wanted to listen to it. They told him he would have to go out to the car and to everyone else’s surprise he opened a cupboard and there was all the latest stereo equipment right there.’. Sadly, the cassette went missing after the Queen Mother’s death in 2002, although Mr Holloway wonders if a copy might still exist somewhere.  .",

    "document": "Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)The question haunting Kiev is this: Who might be murdering allies of Ukraine's ousted President Viktor Yanukovych? The idea that this might be happening is not entirely new. But it muscled its way to the fore again this week with two high-profile shooting deaths in the Ukrainian capital -- one of a former member of parliament with ties to Yanukovych, the other of a Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views. Oleg Kalashnikov, the former member of parliament, was shot and killed shortly after 7 p.m. Wednesday at the entrance to his apartment block. Kalashnikov, 52, was a member of the Party of Regions, the former ruling party in Ukraine, and was close to Yanukovych. Police are investigating the death as a murder. A day later, on Thursday, journalist Oles Buzyna, 45, was killed near his home by shots fired from a dark blue Ford Focus, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. The car's license plates were reported to have been from either Latvia or Belorussia. The killings renewed speculation, sparked by earlier unusual deaths, about a conspiracy to kill people close to Yanukovych. At least three former members of parliament with the Party of Regions have reportedly committed suicide in the last seven weeks:. • On February 28, Mikhail Chechetov reportedly jumped from the window of his 17th-floor apartment in Kiev, having left a suicide note. He was suspected of having falsified the results of a parliamentary vote in early 2014 that essentially prohibited protest just as thousands of people were protesting against the Yanukovych government. • On March 9, Stanislav Melnik, a former member of parliament with the Party of Regions and the manager of several businesses in the separatist-minded eastern city of Donetsk, was found dead in his apartment near Kiev. He, too, reportedly left a suicide note. • And three days later, on March 12, Oleksandr Peklushenko, another former member of parliament, was found in his house in Zaporizhzhya, in southeastern Ukraine, dead of a gunshot wound. Police are investigating various scenarios, including suicide. Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said Peklushenko \"might have wanted to avoid punishment for using violence against protesters, which he was suspected of.\" Ukraine is deeply divided, and it has been for years. About a third of the population speaks Russian as opposed to Ukrainian. Whether the country should be drawn into the orbit of Russia or the West is a visceral issue, a question for many Ukrainians not of politics but of identity. Recent events have deepened the divide. In 2014, after Yanukovych turned his back on the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia, he was driven from office by mass demonstrations. And with Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea and its support for Russian-speaking separatists in eastern Ukraine, the internecine animosity made the ugly transformation into war. With a government toppled and armed conflict in the east, Ukrainians have reason to want each other dead. But the view of who might be responsible for the series of deaths differs starkly, according to which side of the country's divide one is on. The Opposition Bloc, the country's major opposition party, has no doubt the deaths have been politically motivated -- \"bloody terror against opposition politicians and journalists,\" the bloc's media office called them. \"It is clear oppression of those who are not afraid to criticize the government,\" it said. The government, unsurprisingly, sees things differently. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who came to office after Yanukovych was ousted, has demanded an investigation of the killings of Kalashnikov and Buzyna, his media office said. \"It is evident that these crimes have the same origin,\" the media office quoted Poroshenko as saying. \"Their nature and political sense are clear. It is a deliberate provocation that plays in favor of our enemies. It is aimed at destabilizing the internal political situation in Ukraine and discrediting the political choice of the Ukrainian people.\" And Anton Geraschenko, an adviser to the country's interior minister, took the theory one step further. \"It should not be excluded that the killings of Oleg Kalashnikov and Olez Buzyna were planned and organized from Moscow and are a part of a plan to destabilize Ukraine and further support anti-Ukrainian mood in Russian society,\" Geraschenko said.",

    "document": "Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva is relishing the prospect of a long-awaited Wembley appearance after injury robbed him of the chance three years ago. The Reds made three trips to the national stadium in 2012 after winning the League Cup and losing the FA Cup to Chelsea, but the Brazil international missed all of them with a serious knee injury sustained in the previous November. But having played his part in the 1-0 quarter-final win at Blackburn, Lucas is hoping to get his chance in the last-four encounter with Aston Villa on April 19. Lucas Leiva (right) celebrates with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after getting to the FA Cup semi-final. Lucas (left) challenges Markus Olsson as Liverpool beat Blackburn 1-0 in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. Lucas can play his first game at Wembley in a Liverpool shirt when they meet Aston Villa in the semi-final. 'Unfortunately I got an injury before we got to Wembley so I missed [the chance to play there],' he said. 'Hopefully I'll be fit and be able to play at Wembley. I've never played there, so it will be a very good experience and after many years here, to have that chance is amazing. 'I think everyone could see how hard we worked. We knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions, but I think we did well and we are so happy to get to Wembley and hopefully get to the final.' Victory over Blackburn intensified talk of the team giving captain Steven Gerrard, who departs for Los Angeles Galaxy, the perfect send-off as his birthday falls on the day of the final. However, the midfielder was suspended for the tie at Ewood Park and it was Lucas's compatriot Philippe Coutinho who made the difference with a 70th-minute strike, having scored a brilliant last-minute winner in a fourth-round replay at Bolton. Coutinho has arguably been Liverpool's best player over the last five months having not only finally seemed to have grown in stature as a playmaker but also adding goals to his armoury. 'I have known him for a very long time and I know what he's capable of doing,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'He's becoming an even bigger player for the club and he's got a long way to go in terms of age and experience, but he's already right there with the top players.' Another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against Rovers and even stopped opposite number Simon Eastwood scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the Rovers keeper came up for a throw-in in added time. The Belgium international has overcome his early-season wobbles when he seemed to be the cause of much of Liverpool's defensive frailties. He admits victory over Blackburn was important after back-to-back Premier League defeats put a huge dent in their Champions League aspirations. 'After the result against Arsenal there wasn't much time to think because we knew there was going to be a game on Wednesday,' Mignolet said. 'So we had to recover well, put the focus to Blackburn and then make sure that we did the things we wanted to do. 'I think the lads and the team responded really well, did their jobs and did what the gaffer asked us to do, and we managed to get the result we wanted. 'We needed to bounce back after two disappointing results against Manchester United and Arsenal and we did that. 'We gave something back to the fans, who have got something to look forward to now as well with a trip to Wembley. Philippe Coutinho (right) scored the decisive goal for Liverpool, drilling a low shot in off the far post . Simon Mignolet (left) produced another commanding display in goal for Liverpool at Ewood Park. Mignloet praised the Liverpool supporters and is targeting reaching the final of the FA Cup. 'They stand behind us at every single away game, they turn up in numbers and it's always nice to play in front of that crowd. 'They pushed us forward and they have something to look forward to now with a big game at Wembley. Hopefully we can get to the final as well.' As a result of Liverpool's semi-final involvement their league match at Hull scheduled for that weekend has been rescheduled for Tuesday, April 28 at the KC Stadium.  .",

Ex-QPR boss Harry Redknapp has described the club as 'like a bit of a soap opera' after quitting in February. Striker Charlie Austin celebrates after scoring in QPR's 3-3 draw with Aston Villa on Tuesday night. He said: 'I always thought I had everyone pulling with me and suddenly I felt some were and some weren't. I didn't know who was on my side at the end and who wasn't. 'Behind the scenes, I always thought there were one or two people with their own agendas. 'There was always talk about Tim Sherwood coming in. It was like a bit of a soap opera. 'QPR was in the paper every day. I've been at lots of other clubs, big clubs as well, where you didn't get that. That got on my nerves. That was the big problem for me.

Annual price growth across the country will then gradually accelerate again over the next five years, hitting 4 per cent by 2020. This year will be the first since 2009 that the UK as a whole out-performs London, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. This is because while prices in the capital stagnate, the housing market is still performing well in the East and South-East, and parts of the Midlands and North of England. But the CEBR said this victory for the provinces would be short-lived, since the London market will also recover in 2016. Prices there are set to rise by 2.7 per cent next year, above the national average of 2.3 per cent. London homes will also suffer no more price falls in the foreseeable future – and are forecast to see annual growth of an estimated 4.7 per cent by 2020. The predictions from economists at the think-tank were upgraded from their forecast in January, when they suggested average prices would fall this year. They said that radical changes to stamp duty had given the market a boost. In recent years many Britons had been deterred from moving home for fear of the punitive tax on house purchases. The tax was charged on the whole value of a property and successive governments had failed to increase thresholds, trapping growing numbers of families above a £125,000 threshold. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year. File photo. But, in December, the Coalition overhauled the system, replacing the unfair ‘slab’ structure with gradually increasing rates, which cut tax bills for the vast majority of movers. . Economist Scott Corfe, of the CEBR, said: ‘House price growth in the UK will rise much slower than last year – but it will still be positive. ‘The market got a bit ahead of itself last year, and at the end of 2014 it began slowing down and plateaued. ‘It has now started to pick up again outside London. We are still not building enough houses to keep pace with population growth so, as long as we have a shortage of supply, prices will keep rising. ‘House prices will continue to grow faster than inflation.’. It was a different story in London, however, where he said interest from overseas buyers had dwindled, pushing down prices. While the stamp duty changes meant lower bills for the majority, those buying million-pound homes have been hit by higher rates – deterring international investors and many wealthy Londoners. Mr Corfe said: ‘Stamp duty reform, as well as the depreciation of the euro against the pound – making London more expensive for European buyers – has affected prices in the capital. ‘Uncertainty around the general election and fears of a mansion tax [under Labour’s plans] may have also driven down demand since the start of the year.’ .  .",
    "claim": "Property prices soared by 10 per cent in 2014 but will grow by just 1.5 per cent over the next 12 months. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent. It follows last year ’s record price hike of 17.4% in the capital. Economists said that the housing market had ‘ got ahead of itself ’",

    "document": "Tokyo (CNN)It's a bird -- It's a plane -- It's an insanely fast Japanese bullet train. A Japan Railway maglev train hit 603 kilometers per hour (374 miles per hour) on an experimental track in Yamanashi Tuesday, setting a decisive new world record. A spokesperson said the train spent 10.8 seconds traveling above 600 kilometers per hour, during which it covered 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles). That's nearly 20 football fields in the time it took you to read the last two sentences. Takeo Ookanda, who runs an exhibition center next to the test track, said witnesses erupted with excitement and applause when the new record was set. \"I was moved just like many other visitors here today,\" he told CNN. \"This maglev project... (increases) the hope that Japan can have a good growth again in the future.\" The train broke its own record from last Thursday, when it ran at 590 kilometers per hour (366 miles per hour) on a test track. That beat the old record of 581 kilometers per hour (361 miles per hour), which was set in 2003 during another Japanese maglev test. Right now, China operates the world's fastest commercial maglev, which has hit 431 kilometers per hour (268 miles per hour) on a route through Shanghai. By contrast, the fastest train in the United States, Amtrak's Acela Express, is only capable of 241 kilometers per hour (150 miles per hour), though it usually plods along at half that speed. Unlike traditional trains, maglev trains work by using magnets to push the train away from the tracks and drive the train forward. Japan's maglevs don't use metal tracks — instead, they float nearly 10 cm (4 inches) above special guideways, allowing for frictionless movement. Japan Railways has been testing their train to figure out the best operational speed for a planned route between Tokyo and Nagoya, scheduled to begin service in 2027. That trip can take nearly 5 hours by car. But in the future, a maglev train could finish the journey in 40 minutes. READ MORE: The future of transportation will blow your hair back.

    "document": "Scott Kelley, now 50, has been arrested a decade after he fled the U.S with stepdaughter Mary Nunes, and her mother Genevieve Kelley. A teacher who fled the U.S. with his stepdaughter and her mother ten years ago has finally given himself up in Costa Rica. Scott Kelley, now 50, and stepdaughter Mary Nunes, now 19, gave surrendered at the U.S. embassy on Monday and were flown back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, where Kelley was arrested. The pair fled New Hampshire in 2004 along with Genevieve Kelley, Mary's mother, during a custody dispute with Mark Nunes, Genevieve's former husband and Mary's father. Genevieve, now 50, handed herself in last November, but refused to give up the location of her husband and daughter, who had not been seen for a decade until this week. Speaking to People magazine, Scott Kelley said: 'It was time to come home.' He is now facing a charge of custodial interference, the same charge his wife is due to face in court next month. Kelley's case dates back to December 2004 when Mark Nunes, a physician, was granted custody of daughter Mary, then eight, to take her for treatment for an unspecified illness. However, Genevieve, also a physician, refused to hand the girl over, instead taking her to Colorado for a second opinion, where a doctor diagnosed her with acute post traumatic stress disorder. While in Colorado, Genevieve alleged that Mr Nunes had sexually abused the girl, and then fled to South America along with current husband Scott. The state Division of Children, Youth and Families investigated and said any claims of abuse were 'unfounded,' and instead concluded that Genevieve instead likely abused the girl. Charges were never brought, however, because by that point the Kelleys, along with Mary Nunes, had already vanished. Mary Nunes, disappeared when she was aged 8 (left), and is now aged 19 (digitally aged version, right). The Kelleys fled after Mark Nunes, Mary's biological father, was granted custody of his daughter in 2004. Genevieve (pictured) refused to hand her daughter over to Mr Nunes, and took the girl first to Colorado, then boarded a flight to South America and was not seen again for a decade. Despite well-publicized searches of the U.S., Canada, and South America, and dozens of other appeals, there was no sign of the family until February last year. Shortly after Mary turned 18, and was therefore no longer subject to the family court, Genevieve made contact with the authorities, but refused to come forward. Then, on  Monday, November 13, she finally appeared, saying she needed medical treatment for a son she gave birth to with Scott while she was in hiding. But despite pressure from officials, and pleas from her former husband, she refused to reveal the location of Mary, or husband Scott, saying only that the girl was safe. Then, on Monday, officials were alerted that Scott and Mary had come forward after the pair went to the U.S. Department of State office in Costa Rica to get travel documents to return home. Deputy Marshal Jamie Berry, New Hampshire case manager for the Kelley case, said marshals were alerted to the family's travel arrangements, and stopped them as they landed. Genevieve, now aged 50, was arrested by authorities in November last year after she came forward asking for medical treatment for a son that she gave birth to while in hiding. Scott and Mary were taken into custody at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (pictured) on Monday. Mary is now living at an undisclosed location in the U.S., while Scott is in police custody. Mr Berry said: 'Investigators talked to her and made sure she was OK. We asked if she wanted any other arrangements, and she said no. We wanted to make sure she was there of her own free will. . 'It's been a long ten years. We had a lot of lookalikes we had investigated. We followed a lot of false leads, but we had to follow them all. Mary's safe, and that was the overall goal for us.' Mary has been released from custody and is now staying at an undisclosed location in the U.S., officials said. It was confirmed that she plans to testify at her mother's trial, which is due to begin next month. . Genevieve Kelley had previously argued that her daughter should be allowed to testify by video, but a judge turned this request down, saying she needed to be questioned by prosecutors. Scott Kelley was jailed in Atlanta and couldn't be reached for comment. If he doesn't agree to return to New Hampshire, Berry said, extraditions proceedings will begin. .",

    "document": "Irish betting company Paddy Power is backtracking after tweeting that \"Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male.\" The tweet, a pun on the name of the famous home end at Liverpool Football Club, alluded to recent controversial incidents in the United States in which unarmed African-American men have been killed by police. Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: \"It was a joke, and no offense was meant.\" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: \"We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real.\" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised \"money back if he walks\" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius. Monday's win put Liverpool fifth in the table, four points behind defending champion Manchester City, which holds England's final European Champions League qualification spot with six games left to play this season. Young England forward Raheem Sterling, who has turned down a new contract, scored a fine solo goal in the first half, and midfielder Joe Allen's 70th-minute strike condemned 13th-placed Newcastle to a fifth successive league defeat.

The Dutchman greeted a group of supporters with life-limiting illnesses at the biannual Manchester Foundation Dream Day held at the Aon Training Complex on Monday. And Moshin Tanveer - who suffers from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy - used the special occasion to provide the former Holland boss with a star-studded cast of Europe's top property he should sign in order to bring the Barclays Premier League title back to Old Trafford. Scroll down for video . Moshin Tanveer gleefully awaits Louis van Gaal's reaction to the players he thinks he should sign. Van Gaal reads the carefully written document containing the names of who he 'should' bring to Old Trafford. Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) £36m. Gareth Bale (Real Madrid) £120m. Paul Pogba (Juventus) £75m. Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton) £15m. Memphis Depay (PSV Eindhoven) £30m. Jackson Martinez (Porto) £25m .

'I take it in mind,' van Gaal says, before folding the sheet of paper and putting it in his pocket. 'You are smart, and a very cheap manager.' . Tanveer told the Dutchman not to follow up the loan signing of Radamel Falcao with a permanent deal, and also suggested that striker Robin van Persie should be sold. The supporter's mentor said he had spent a week writing up his shortlist ahead of the foundation day, and after being warmly received by the manager, the beaming recipient of a signed home shirt said, 'It was really nice of him to do that.

Ahead of Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley, Rodgers indicated it could take two decades for Sheik Mansour’s club to reach the status of either Liverpool or Manchester United. City have been heavily linked with a £50million move for Sterling, who has two years left on his contract and is stalling on a new deal. The champions have also monitored vice-captain Jordan Henderson, who only has a season left on his Anfield contract. Brendan Rodgers says that a move to Manchester City would not be step up for Raheem Sterling. Rodgers talks to Sterling during Friday's training session ahead of FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa. However, Rodgers was emphatic that moving to City would not represent a step up. ‘If you say that City is a bigger club than Liverpool, you’re wrong,’ he said. ‘I’ve got big respect for what City are doing — they’re trying to build it the right way. But at this moment you can’t compare the size of the two clubs. ‘You’ve got Liverpool and United, the two biggest clubs in this country and the rest of them are fighting to be there over the next 20 years. I wouldn’t say we were a development ground for going to “bigger” clubs.’. City have tried to sign players from Arsenal and Liverpool hoping to weaken their rivals. They have bought Gael Clichy, Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Kolo Toure from Arsenal but failed to lure Fernando Torres when he was at Anfield. . Sterling is wanted by Manchester City this summer for £50million as he stalls over new contract. Sterling has been one of Liverpool's leading lights and was nominated for PFA Young Player of the Year. This summer, Liverpool will also try to sign James Milner from City. Rodgers hopes victory over Villa will strengthen his case and increase the chances of keeping players. ‘Our vision is to win trophies,’ he said. ‘The first objective was to get into the Champions League again. We arrived there this year and could focus on winning a trophy. We just have to concentrate on performance levels, get to the final and we’ll take it from there.’.

    "document": "Gary Player will attend his 58th Masters this week fully expecting to welcome a new member to the game’s most exclusive club and salute what he considers would be one of the sport’s finest accomplishments. The great man considers Tiger Woods completing the career Grand Slam at the age of just 24 as the best golfing feat he has seen. So you can imagine how excited he is at the prospect of Rory McIlroy becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors at only 25. ‘I’m not sure people fully realise what a magnificent effort it would be,’ said the South African legend. ‘When I completed my Slam at 29 I said to my wife that you will never see that done again. Then Jack Nicklaus came along and did it at 26 and then Tiger at 24. Jack Nicklaus watches his shot go for a birdie on the 17th at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta in 1986. Rory McIlroy meets up with South African Golf Legend Gary Player during the pro-am in 2009. Rory McIlroy, pictured in action at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and is favourite to win the Masters. ‘Now we have Rory, and I tell you this: I honestly believe he is going to do it. I just believe everything is going to fall into place for him, that he will learn from the mistakes he made when he messed up in 2011 and put everything right.’. It is not hard to see why Player would have such a special affinity for McIlroy. Two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the Americans in the majors in their own backyard; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism. Forget Tiger. It was Player, of course, who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness. Heavens, he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now, at the age of 79. He is withering in his contempt of those who say McIlroy is ‘bulking up’ too much in the gym. ‘I’m going to guess most of the critics are fat and don’t watch what they eat,’ he says. ‘Just because they’re lazy, they can’t grasp that fitness is so vital. Tom Watson presents Player with a Green Jacket after the 1978 Masters Tournament at Augusta National. ‘I was told that because I was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and I wouldn’t win any tournaments after the age of 34. I was told I had no chance of winning the US Open if I was squatting 325lb the previous evening. What rubbish. ‘I’m just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier. I used to go down to the local YMCA wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment. But it you want to be a superstar, and by a superstar I mean a player who has won at least six majors, there are no short cuts. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta . ‘Rory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the Masters. And yes, I can see a lot of similarities with myself. I love the fact he is a people person, for example, and engages with the fans. That’s what I used to love, and still do. So many pros can’t be bothered to talk to the fans and it’s so wrong.’ Player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career Grand Slam is a modern media invention. ‘I tell you it was electrifying when I completed it in 1965,’ he said. ‘I so wanted to follow Gene Sarazen and particularly Ben Hogan and become the third player to achieve it, because Hogan was the best player I’d seen. Jack and I were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice Jack gave me that helped me over the line. ‘I was due to play a tournament at Greensboro in 1965 when Jack said if I wanted to win the US Open and complete the set I should go with him to the US Open site and practise. I said I needed the money, that I had loads of children to look after, but I went with him. So he played a key role. McIlroy manages a smile after throwing away a four-shot lead on the final day of the Masters in 2011. Jack Nicklaus  waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the 2014 Masters golf tournament. ‘It was amazing afterwards. Everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing. How on earth could it happen?’. Player and Nicklaus have remained lifelong friends. They will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before Player heads to Greece for his 80th birthday celebrations. ‘There will be 35 people there and Jack and I will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it,’ said Player, laughing. As for Augusta, he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on Thursday alongside Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And then, 50 years on from his own date with history, he will join every other fascinated observer to see if another non-American can complete the set of majors and join him on what former US Open champion Curtis Strange evocatively refers to as golf’s Mount Rushmore.",

Headteacher Linda Shute has banned children from consuming drinks - including tea, coffee, fruit juice and soft drinks - in a bid to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School in New Addington, south London. But some parents believe the water-only rule is too strict, claiming many children go all day without a drink because they do not like water. Scroll down for video . A headteacher is forcing primary school pupils to only drink water during the school day after banning all other drinks, including fruit juice. Samantha Moore, who launched the petition, said: 'As a mother, I have the right to choose what my son drinks.' Another campaigner, Anela, from Croydon, added: 'They should be able to drink whatever they want and not just water because some kids don't like water.' . Mrs Shute, who announced her aims by enforcing the rule in a school newsletter last month, said: 'The water-only policy is being very well supported by parents and children. 'Thank you for this and know in your hearts, if you have any doubts, this policy is for the long-term health of all your children.' But her move provoked a backlash from some, who branded it a 'joke'. Alan Fay said: 'It's about time that schools started looking after the kids again and stop just doing what is told by the powers above.' Gemma Irwin, from New Addington, added : 'I believe that it should be up to the parent what their child drinks. 'If teachers are allowed tea and coffee, why can't a child have a bottle of juice or flavoured water?' . But the school has defended its decision. The rule has been enforced to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School (pictured) in New Addington, south London. It follows a similar ban which sparked anger at Valence Primary School in Dagenham, east London, when it was introduced in January last year. Headteacher Elizabeth Chaplin brought in the new rule as part of a 'health drive' and drinks other than water were poured down the sink. In June last year, children at Carlton Central Infants' School in Nottingham, were barred from drinking fruit squash - a measure opposed by some parents. Tam Fry, chairman of the Child Growth Foundation and spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, is among campaigners who have pushed for healthy drink options in schools. He has praised schools that clamp down on sugar-filled juices, which he believes should be limited to one small glass a week. Mr Fry said: 'Fruit juice is known to be really laden with sugar, and it needs to be a treat - not an everyday occurrence. The preference in schools should be water, which is hugely beneficial.'  .",

    "document": "As he kept two young women locked up as sex slaves in his basement, Ariel Castro was looking for a wife, a new book about the Cleveland kidnapper has revealed. A 39-year-old woman named Lillian Roldan came forward to author John Glatt to say she dated Castro from 2000 to 2003, a three-year period during which Castro kidnapped and imprisoned Michelle Knight and Amanda Berry in his Ohio home. Roldan describes Castro in Glatt's book The Lost Girls as nothing short of a gentleman, who was 'completely normal' in the bedroom, and even romantic. Scroll down for video . Blinded by love: Lillian Roldan (left) says she dated Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro (right) from 2000 to 2003. She says she visited his house often and never knew about the young women he was keeping prisoner. However, she says he did keep his basement padlocked, which she found peculiar. When she asked about the need to lock the door, Castro allegedly told Roldan that he kept his money stored down there and 'didn't want his kids to steal it'. . In the book set to be published later this month, Roldan recalls meeting 16-years-older Castro on a blind date set up by friends in May 2000. He allegedly invited her to watch him play music one night and it was 'love at first sight'. Under her nose: During the three years she was with Castro, he would kidnap 21-year-old Michelle Knight and 17-year-old Amanda Berry. A few months after breaking up, he kidnapped his third victim Gina DeJuses. Roldan pictured above with another man in a picture posted to Facebook. Seemingly normal: Roldan detailed her 'romantic' relationship with Castro in the new book The Lost Girls by John Glatt . Roldan visited Castro at his house often, and sometimes ran into his ex-wife Grimilda Figueroa. Castro abused Figuero during their marriage, but he acted so kind around Roldan that she thought the beatings were just a rumor. As for their sex life, Roldan says Castro was 'completely normal' and 'considerate'. . She says at one point during their relationship, Castro popped the question but Roldan declined since she didn't believe in marriage. . After the proposal, Castro remained dedicated to Roldan and even bought her a ruby ring. After buying the flashy piece of jewelry, Castro took Roldan along to one of his music gigs where he had yet another romantic gesture in store. . Free women: Amanda Berry (left), Gina DeJesus (center) and Michelle Knight (right), were held captive in Castro's home for years. They found freedom in May 2013, when Berry's 6-year-old child helped the trio escape . Stolen youth: Castro kidnapped Michelle Knight (right) in 2002 when she was 21, eight months later he kidnapped then 17-year-old Amanda Berry (left). A year later, he captured 14-year-old Gina DeJesus (center) Mid-way through the performance, he took the microphone and told the audience: 'Today, I gave my girlfriend Lillian a ring.' . 'So everyone clapped,' Lillian recalls. 'And he told the group that he wanted to sing \"La Bamba\" for me. It was so romantic and I was charmed. It was such a special [night] and he really did show me love.' While Castro remained the normal man she called her boyfriend, two years into their relationship he started harboring a secret at home. . In August 2002, Castro kidnapped then 21-year-old Michelle Knight and locked her in his basement. Eight months later, he kidnapped another girl, 17-year-old Amanda Berry. Apparently distracted by the two young women that he was torturing at home, Castro abruptly cut ties with Roldan in October of that year, sending her a letter that said he 'didn't love her enough to stay.' . Prison: Above, Catro's Cleveland home where he kept the three women locked up for years . Five months after Roldan received the unexpected break-up letter, Castro's third victim, Gina DeJesus, went missing. She was 14 years old at the time. . For the next nine years the women were locked inside Castro's home and kept secret from the outside world. . The three women found freedom in May 2013, when Berry's 6-year-old daughter by Castro helped the trio to escape the house and alert police. Castro was arrested and sentenced to life in prison plus $1,000 years. About a month after his sentencing, Castro committed suicide in prison. .",

Frustrated listeners say the vital last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions uploaded to the iPlayer service. . They branded the problem ‘irritating’, ‘annoying’ and ‘frustrating’ and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. . Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system.  . But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. . It was raised by the BBC’s own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: ‘Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off? . 'All because you can’t be bothered to check that whole show was there. Please, if you are going to make available a programme I have missed can I have the whole programme?’. Another added: ‘I enjoy radio drama immensely but just recently I have found that some final episodes have last the vital few minutes. I was simply left hanging in the air at a very crucial stage.’. Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. According to the BBC’s own figures, in February this year, 57million ‘requests’ were made for radio programmes on BBC iPlayer. . Each request means a person chose to listen to a show. Of this number, one quarter were people listening to programmes on catch-up, a jump from one in five the previous month. As the use of catch-up becomes increasingly popular, more people will suffer from shows missing their final moments. Andrew Scott, General Manager of the BBC’s Audience Facing Services, appeared on Feedback and apologised for the problem and said they are now adding two minutes to the end of all its recordings in an attempt to stamp out the problem. He told the programme: ‘There are a lot of shows every week that are made available on demand and we simply can’t humanly check every single one of those, so what we are trying to do is make sure we have the very best fail safe systems in place.’ .",

    "document": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Stan Freberg, whose freewheeling comic career in advertising garnered him worldwide acclaim and whose satirical entertainments abounded on TV, the radio and on records, has died. He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. \"He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,\" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a \"guerilla satirist.\" The New York Times dubbed him the \"Che Guevara of advertising,\" and years later, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. \"Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,\" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. \"RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend.\" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. \"Wun'erful Wun'erful,\" his 1957 spoof of \"champagne music\" — on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May — lampooned \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit \"Cry,\" which Freberg rendered as \"Try.\" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including \"St. George and the Dragonet,\" a 1953 send-up of the series \"Dragnet.\" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, \"That's Rich.\" Three years later, he presented \"The Stan Freberg Show\" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: \"Mad Men's\" return. He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for \"The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows.\" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy \"Time for Beany,\" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an \"office\" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show \"Toast of the Town.\" Hollywood Reporter: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" -- the untold story. Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as \"Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,\" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in \"Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was \"More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,\" and he even had a corporate motto: \"Ars Gratia Pecuniae\" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon \"What's Brewin', Bruin,\" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's \"Three Little Bops.\" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's \"Lady and the Tramp\" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, \"Back in Action\" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear. Survivors also include his wife, Hunter, and a granddaughter. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.",

    "document": "The Fulham fans in the Jimmy Steed Stand applauded their team at the final whistle. It was not the victory manager Kit Symons had called for but a point away to Charlton probably secures their future in the Championship next season. They are eight points clear of Millwall and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the Premier League last season is alarming. A vertiginous decline, just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4-1 trouncing by bitter rivals Brentford last week, Symons was looking for a quick response from his players. . Johann Gudmundsson celebrates his first-half effort as Charlton come from behind to earn a point. The Icelandic winger is joined by his Charlton teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at The Valley. He got it with Ross McCormack giving them the lead after eight minutes. A superb long ball by Michael Turner found Matt Smith who headed on to the Scotsman to loop the ball over the top of Charlton goalkeeper Stephen Henderson in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the Jimmy Seed stand. The passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling Charlton fans harbour towards Scott Parker. The midfielder, who missed the Brentford game through illness, departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos. Not that it seemed to affect him as he dictated the pace of the game in the early stages, feeding striker Smith well. Ross McCormack headed over a stranded Stephen Henderson with just eight minutes played in London . McCormack celebrates his goal in front of the traveling Fulham fans with just eight minutes played. Charlton Athletic: Henderson, Gomez, Ben Haim, Johnson, Fox, Johann Gudmundsson, Cousins, Diarra, Bulot (Eagles 70) Vetokele (Church 79) Watt. Subs: Bikey Amougou, Wiggins, Lennon, Dmitrovic, Lepoint. Fulham: Bettinelli, Hoogland, Burn, Turner, Husband, Parker, Tunnicliffe, Guthrie,(Kacaniklic 68), Kavanagh (Ruiz 68), Smith, McCormack . Subs: Kiraly, Stafylidis, Woodrow, Rodallega, Donnelly. But Charlton hit back with a 16th minute equaliser. Morgan Fox’s cross bounced across the front of goal and Frederic Bulot swung a leg at it but could not connect. . It was left for a waiting Johann Gudmundsson to fire his 10th goal of the season into the top right corner. Goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, who seemed rooted to the spot, wisely dragged a furious James Husband, who seemed to believe the goal offside, from a confrontation with the linesman. Almost the whole stadium thought Gudmundsson had nabbed his second when Igor Vetokele set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss, hitting the side netting instead. The second half was low in quality but high in chances. The visitors seemed reenergised after the interval, forcing a save in the 46th minute. Matt Smith found space in the centre of the box and got his head on a pinpoint James Husband cross but Henderson did well to thwart the effort. Charlton soon asserted control with Tony Watt going close three times before Parker was booked for bringing him down with a late challenge. The Charlton players were outraged when referee Andy Madley awarded Fulham a free kick 25 yards out deep into stoppage time but McCormack blasted the ball over the bar. Joseph Gomez  and Dan Burn fight for the ball during match between Charlton Athletic and Fulham. Fulham now sit 20th in the table eight points clear of fellow London rivals Millwall, but Symons is refusing to relax just yet. He said: ‘We’re definitely not safe until it’s mathematically sure because this league is topsy turvy at both ends and it is going to go to the wire. . 'But I can’t be greedy so I will take the point and I was pleased with the performance.’. Tony Watt skips past Danny Gutherie  during the Sky Bet Championship match  The Valley.",

    "document": "Starbucks is embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs after it was accused of using a little-known British company to avoid paying taxes across Europe. The U.S. coffee giant is being probed by the European Commission over some of the methods it used to lower its tax bills. It could face millions of pounds in back taxes if they are found to be illegal. For the first time yesterday, details emerged about the UK company at the heart of the probe, which is focusing on sweetheart tax deals between Starbucks and the Dutch government. Probe: Starbucks ran its European division - including the UK - through the Netherlands, but it paid just £1.9million in tax to the Dutch government, from a reported £300million profit. Starbucks ran its European business, including its booming UK division, through the Netherlands where it paid almost no tax on its profits. But it has now emerged that the coffee chain used a defunct British entity to hide potentially millions of pounds from the Dutch taxman. By registering its Intellectual Property – such as its brand and logo – in a UK company called Alki LP, it was able to pay hefty sums from its Netherlands division into Britain. Its Dutch division paid just £1.9million of tax, despite reporting profits of £300million – a meagre tax rate of less than 1per cent. A Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered previously unknown details about the UK entity, including a claim that it had not a single registered employee. Starbucks has already been called ‘immoral’ by MPs for its labyrinthine structure that effectively funnelled money out of the UK. Schemes used by the company include buying its coffee beans in Switzerland and selling them at a 20per cent mark-up to the Netherlands, where they are then roasted before being sold on again to Britain. This means that much of the money it makes from UK sales flows into jurisdictions that have lower or less stringent tax regimes. Revealed: It is now claimed the company, which has previously been in the spotlight for its tax practices, may have used a British company to put hefty sums from its Netherlands branch into the UK. Between 1998 and 2012 the company paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in Britain, despite racking up combined sales of more than £3billion here. But after its tactics were exposed, the company offered to pay a voluntary £20million in tax to avoid a public boycott. Now details of a little-known tax division have emerged. A UK-registered holding business called Alki LP was set up to house the branding of the business. In a bizarre move, Alki appeared to have no employees – and was registered at the offices of Starbuck’s tax lawyers Baker & McKenzie. Compliance: A Starbucks spokesman said the company complies 'with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines' But because of the very limited details available, it is impossible to identify how much money the arm received – or whether it paid any tax in the UK. Accounts for Starbucks’ Dutch businesses show that they paid several million pounds a year into the division. But without access to full corporate documents it is impossible to tell whether this remained in the UK division or was funnelled straight into another tax haven. The business, which was closed down last year, has never filed proper accounts at Companies House. When it was dissolved, Alki was folded into a new company, Starbucks EMEA Holdings – though this business has also yet to file any accounts. This is an aspect that EU investigators believe is key to their probe. Earlier this year the British boss of Starbucks provoked outrage after suggesting the company would not pay ‘normal’ levels of tax for years. UK managing director Mark Fox said the company needed to get ‘its mojo back’ before it would begin to turn a profit. But he was confounded only weeks later when Starbucks reported its first ever UK profit of £1.1million – despite sales being a bumper £300million. On this it paid taxes of just £232,363, as well as the sum of £11.2million as part of its voluntary £20million tax payment. A Starbucks spokesman said: ‘We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines and we continue to cooperate with the European Commission’s state aid investigation in the Netherlands.’ .  .",

The Belgium striker was signed by Liverpool in a £10million deal after impressing at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, before being loaned back to Lille for the 2014-15 season. But Origi has been following Liverpool's progress from across the English Channel and after seeing the rise of Ibe and Raheem Sterling, is eagerly anticipating working under Brendan Rodgers.

Origi referenced the progress of winger Jordon Ibe (left) as an example of youth players improving at the club. Origi added that he thinks the long-term progress of Raheem Sterling means he is joining the right club. 'When you see how the coach and the staff work with the young players - how Sterling, for example, has learned over the years and how Ibe is now integrating with the team, it is very interesting,' Origi told Liverpool's official website. 'It is very nice to have seen that this season. 'The manager is one of the reasons I came to Liverpool - he's someone who has proven he knows how to work with young players, knows how to develop young players and also lets them play.' Origi, who has scored seven times in Ligue 1 this season, believes that the backing of Liverpool's supporters will help him elevate his game. 'I'm somebody who when I feel loved, when I feel appreciated by the supporters, then I can give even more. It gives you a boost on the field. In Belgium it was this way, and I can see it at Liverpool.' Origi (second eight) earned a transfer to Liverpool after impressing for Belgium at the 2014 World Cup. Origi added that the challenges he has faced at Lille this season will make him a better player for Liverpool. Origi admits it has been a challenging season at Lille attempting balance the demands of the league with the Europa League but believes the experience he has gained means he will arrive at Liverpool a better player than this time last year.

Residents of Beckley Club Estates in Dallas, Texas, say that they saw a man approach a male peacock, who was in the middle of its mating ritual and had unfurled its full plumage, before quickly snatching him up on Saturday. Footage from the home of Lisa Solis shows the thief grab the animal by both its claws before shoving him in his black SUV around 7pm. Residents of a Dallas neighborhood saw a man approach a male peacock, who was in the middle of its mating ritual and had unfurled its full plumage, before quickly snatching him up on Saturday. The man is seen bending down and picking up the bird by its claws before shoving it into his black Chevy Tahoe with its feathers sticking out of the door. Solis's neighbor Tisha Crear said she saw the event, and rushed out of the house and yelled at the man, but could only watch as he drove off with half of the peacock's feathers hanging out of the door. Ms Crear said that she had heard peahens screaming before the incident when the bird, the largest and oldest male peacock of those that live in the subdivision, was stolen, according to NBC Dallas. Ms Solid called the theft and aggressive treatment of the bird animal cruelty. . 'Do I need to sit on the porch with a shotgun or what do I have to do? Because we are going to protect the peacocks,' Ms Crear said, holding a feather from the stolen bird. Residents of the neighborhood, where peacocks have lived for the past 20 years, filed a report to the police about the missing animal. Surveillance video also shows the black Chevy Tahoe driver stalking the birds for 20 minutes before he grabbed his target. The suspect is described as a Hispanic man who was wearing shorts, a white shirt and a baseball cap. . Peacocks have lived in the neighborhood for 20 years, according to the Dallas Morning News. Residents, who have reported the incident to police, are also worried about the birds' long term survival if the peacock patriarch is not able to return and fertilize eggs. Neighbors have previously organized to protect the animals following one resident's complaint. .",

    "document": "The bumper crop of fruit and veg grown by the dedicated allotment gardeners each year was the talk of the town, and garnered prize after prize each year. The haul of produce was even enough to keep some growers self-sufficient. But now the gardeners are at war with their council after they were moved to new allotments so their old prize-winning plots can be bulldozed to make way for a car park and five-a-side football pitches. Scroll down for video . Living the Good Life: Michael Fyson, 77, has grown his own fruit and veg for more than 10 years. But the Broadway Allotment Association member says soil at the group's new site is 'dreadful' Thriving: The association's allotments were moved by Oldham council. The old prize-winning site (pictured) has been bulldozed to make way for a car park and football pitches. Pay out: But gardeners have complained about their new site, saying it has bad drainage and poor soil. The association has called on the council to pay growers compensation for the problems they've experienced. Many are complaining that the soil in their new allotments is so poor they cannot grow a bean - and that the new plots' drainage is so bad that their seedlings are rotting in the ground. They are demanding that Oldham council pays out compensation for the problems - which have seriously curtailed their growing season. Michael Fyson, 77, has grown his own fruit and veg for more than 10 years and he and his wife, Margaret, 78, live the Good Life as they are largely self-sufficient. He said: ‘The soil is dreadful and the land is flooded. It is impossible to grow there so the allotments are not fit for purpose and need plenty of work. ‘I still have potatoes, leeks, parsnips, cabbage, broccoli, strawberries, raspberries and gooseberries in storage from last year’s crop but this year I’ ll be lucky to grow anything. 'Dreadful': Gardeners say the soil at their new site (pictured) is so poor they can't grow a bean. Oldham council moved the group from their old allotments, which had been popular with residents since the 1930s. The drainage (pictured left) is also so bad that the seedlings of allotment holders are rotting in the ground. They are demanding the council pays out compensation for the problems at the plots in Failsworth, Oldham. ‘My wife and I totally depend on the crop from my allotment each year as we have three freezers to store it and it keeps us going all year.’. Mr Fyson, who has two grandchildren and one great grandson, has won award after award at the annual competition for Best Allotment in Oldham. He said: ‘I’ve done quite well over the year. But this year is going to be dreadful. I’ve been digging some trenches to drain the land and have had to bail out with a bucket. We won’t be able to grow anything of any quality here for quite a while.’. Green as you like: Council chiefs moved the Broadway Allotment Association to land a few hundred yards away from their original prize-winning site (pictured) as part of a plan to redevelop the nearby Lancaster Club. The development will include 144 homes, with the Grade II-listed club turned into apartments and a five-a-side football pitch and car park built on the former allotments where growers (pictured) used to plant their seedlings. Much-loved: One allotment holder, Michael Fyson, 77, has grown fruit and vegetables at the old site (pictured) for more than ten years. He has won award after award at the annual competition for Best Allotment in Oldham. The plots managed by the Broadway Allotment Association in Failsworth, Oldham have been popular with residents since the 1930s and kept many fed during the Second World War. However growers have been moved to land a few hundred yards away as part of a plan to redevelop the nearby Lancaster Club off Broadway into a ‘garden suburb’. The development will include 144 homes, with the Grade II-listed club turned into apartments and a five-a-side football pitch and car park will be built on the former allotments. Oldham council developed the new site and constructed greenhouses and sheds for the growers in recompense for losing their original plots. Ian Wade, 55, association secretary, said: ‘I understand the need to redevelop the area and it would be okay if they had given us a plot that worked. ‘But the soil they have put down is ridiculous. It has powdered brick, rubble, sand and stones in it and it is impossible to grow anything in it. ‘Gardeners can work to improve the soil but it is so shocking nothing will grow for years. The site is also flooded and seems impossible to drain.’. Now, the 17 tenants are calling on the council to give them compensation for the delay they will face in growing their produce and the extra work in making the land fit. Unhappy: Secretary of the the Broadway Allotment Association, Ian Wade (pictured), said the soil which had been put down at the new site was 'ridiculous'. He believes nothing will grow there for years. Oldham council said relocation of the allotments to the new site was not due to be completed until May but growers say this will limit their growing season. The 17 tenants are calling on the council to give compensation. Oldham council’s Elaine McLean said: ‘We are carrying out soil testing in the coming days to establish the cause of the standing water and how we can improve the situation for the plot holders.’. Oldham council said the relocation of the allotments to the new site was not due to be completed until May but growers say it will limit their growing season.

    "document": "In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is pulled out of obscurity, swiftly develops expert bow-and-arrow skills and leads a government rebellion - all without having to deal with braces or a single spot. However, the rise of the young adult heroine has prompted a backlash on Twitter, as more people compare the fictional portrayals with the mediocrity of their own lives. Teenagers have taken to the social media site to hilariously voice their frustrations between the fantastical lives in the pages of books and in films, and reality using the hashtag #realisticYA. The Hunger Games book (left), the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence in the film - pictured right) deals with exciting scenarios but never from any teenage ailments such as acne or braces. Twitter user, Adrienne Long, makes a reference to the fact that many YA heroines have their lives turned upside-down, but they are always prepared. Real life would perhaps be very different. Many of the tweets look at similar dystopian situations to those in the novels, but the Twitter users describe their own realistic reactions, or what would really be probable. Comparing real life to Katniss Everdeen's role in The Hunger Games, Adrienne Long tweets: 'Girl finds out she has impossible destiny to fulfill. Fails miserably having never spent a day preparing for it #realisticYA.' Some funny tweets simply address that at a time when many teenagers are going through the awkward stages of puberty, the YA protagonists are completely free from any awkward ailments. Joanna Macgregor tweeted: 'I met this new guy at school. He's really freaking cute but he has, like, zits, and I have, y'know, a muffin-top.' . Young adults tell it like is is on Twitter under the hashtag #realistic YA. One teen addresses that unlike her perfect YA contemporaries, she suffers from  adolescent ailments. Another girl's tweet refers to Twilight, where the main character has to choose from multiple love-interests. Some look at dangerous scenarios and what would be likely to happen. . Rather than escaping every situation unscathed, the Twitter users take a wry and straight-forward approach to the situation. . Referring to the Twilight novel, one writer refers to Bella's choice between her multiple love-interests Jacob and Edward. . Danielle Welling writes: 'Girl has no problem choosing between two equally hot boys in love with her. Because no hot boys love her. #realisticYA.'  . Other tweets look at young teens in a realistic manner, calling them '100% human' rather than 'mysterious and broody', and others look at realistic situations that arise with teen romances. Another tweet describes being too busy to be the 'chosen one' - referring to the character Beatrice Prior in Divergent. Preeti Chhibber writes: 'Girl is Chosen One but actually has 250hrs of community service, college apps, SATs and resume building so she can't but thx #realisticYA.'   . Not the chosen one? In the book Divergent (left), Beatrice Prior, who is played by Shailene Woodley in the film (pictured right with actor Theo James) is the 'chosen' one and leads a rebellion against the corrupt goverment. One user points out that many would not have the time to simply drop their lives to become the 'Chosen One' The hashtag on Twitter sees users comparing the reality of their own lives to young adult heroines . This #realisticYA looks at the fact that real teenage scenarios can mean that sometimes love is unrequited. If Harry Potter had never gone to Hogwarts, JK Rowling may have had five or six less books to write. Some of the tweets are hilarious because if the character in question did what the tweet suggests, much of the action in the novels would have never happened. Linda Newbery tweets: 'Boy thinks about running away, but changes mind when he realises that life at home is just too comfortable.'  . Many can imagine what the Harry Potter books would have been like if Harry never went to wizard school, Hogwarts. . How young adults would really react to situations in novels revealed on Twitter. Another Twitter user users the hashtag to voice her concern that romantic leads have to be 'broody' or a 'jerk' Another girl writes about the realistic possibility that teenagers might be too frightened to confront their romantic interests. Hundreds of Twitter users have taken part in the hashtag. Others have written funny commentaries about how swiftly the heroine's life changes - and how a normal teenager, put in the same scenario, would be highly unprepared and may miss the opportunity. Another tweet explores the fact that on several occasions in YA novels, the protagonist may meet a mysterious, handsome stranger who aids her, but unlike normal teens is never overwhelmed or nervous. . Lustybustyliz writes: 'Girl meets boy at the library. He's smart, cute & interested. She has a panic attack and hides in the bathroom.'",

Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the Barclays Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to reshape their squad after a disappointing season. But Toure will fight for his City career this summer despite the club pondering his future. . Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make him available this summer. Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the  Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian. He is said to be content with life at the Etihad Stadium despite the difficulties and is in no rush to leave. The Ivorian has played a major role during City's recent trophy-laden period, helping the club to two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and League Cup since joining from Barcelona in 2010. And the powerhouse midfielder still believes he can have a major impact for City in the future and remains fully committed to the cause. Another stumbling block towards a potential move is the four-time African Player of the Year winner's wages. . Inter Milan, managed by Roberto Mancini, are interested but given his huge wages there are some doubts. Toure has more than two years left on his current £220,000-a-week deal and is unlikely to move for anything less. A number of clubs, such as Inter Milan, are interested in the 31-year-old, but given his huge salary there must be doubts over whether they would be able to afford it. Inter are prepared to offer Toure a five-year deal to compensate for the pay-cut he would be required to take if he moved to Italy — although, it remains to be seen whether he'd agree to such a compromise. There have been preliminary talks about a contract extension for Toure at City — which included the possibility of an ambassadorial role when he hangs up his boots. But it seems the club are now happy for him to leave. . City, meanwhile, will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao, currently on loan at Manchester United. City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo this summer. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a clause involving a permanent move to the Mestalla. Reports in Spain  suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a £20.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday’s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer but reports in Spain say they are looking at Radamel Falcao. Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has, however, not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao, who is set to leave United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim and offloading Negredo is seen as one way of affording the Colombia star. City had scouts at Porto, watching their 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, with the home team’s Brazilian left-back Alex Sandro said to be the main focus of interest.

    "document": "Half of hospitals in England are allowing patients to jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, new figures reveal (file picture) Half of hospitals are letting patients jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, an investigation has revealed. Some are charging up to a ‘shameful’ £2,700 for one eye – treble what it costs the health service – raising suspicions that they are ripping off elderly patients. Cataract treatment is being rationed in England to save money, even though the NHS recently announced it would fund weight-loss surgery for 15,000 obese adults every year at a cost of £6,000 each. . Yesterday the Mail revealed how millions was being wasted on prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Many NHS trusts have imposed arbitrary rules to determine who is eligible for cataract treatment, and patients who cannot read, sew or watch television are routinely turned away. . Those patients who do meet the strict criteria often have to wait eight months for treatment, over which time their eyesight deteriorates further and impairs basic tasks and hobbies. Freedom of Information responses from 78 hospital trusts in England obtained by the Mail found that 41 offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery themselves. The operation usually costs the NHS between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700. Campaigners accused hospitals of profiting from elderly patients. Clara Eaglen, from the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: ‘It’s shameful that people are being asked to consider funding their own treatment when they are entitled to it for free, and in a timely manner, on the NHS. Scroll down for video . ‘We strongly believe that everyone who has a sight-threatening condition deserves early access to treatments.’. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘In the last few years it has become harder to access cataract surgery as people are forced to wait for their sight to significantly deteriorate before getting help. ‘It is extremely worrying if people whose sight is starting to fail feel the only way to get help quickly is to pay for it. ‘Cataracts are extremely debilitating and treatment should be based on a clinical need not age or bank balance.’. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, added: ‘The NHS belongs to the people, and all patients have the right to access appropriate treatment at the right time and in the right setting, irrespective of their ability to pay; we cannot and should not have a two-tier NHS.’. In England, 41 hospital trusts said they offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery. The operation costs the NHS about between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700. More than half of over-65s suffer from cataracts, which are cloudy patches in the lens that make vision blurred or misty. Sight can be restored in a simple 45-minute operation, with doctors using ultrasound waves to break up the cataract. . Most hospitals charge patients between £700 and £1,000 per eye for cataract treatment and say the money is spent on improving services. But this rises to £2,552 at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey and £2,700 at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust in Kent. Several trusts actively encourage patients to ‘self-fund’. The University Hospital Southampton’s website informs patients that ‘surgery will be offered much sooner than the usual NHS wait’. It adds: ‘Our cataract choice service offers a new option, between the traditional private sector and the NHS, bringing private healthcare within the reach of many more people.’. Yeovil District Hospital in Somerset says its private cataract service will ‘help you get back to the things you love’. Patients at North Cumbria are offered free parking and a daily newspaper, while at Frimley Park they can choose from an ‘exclusive a la carte menu’, which includes whitebait and chicken goujons.",

    "document": "A federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, a convicted felon, with unlawful possession of a firearm. In this week's indictment,  Durst, 71, is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver, which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge, according to the indictment. The charge is the latest in a litany of accusations. A Louisiana judge ruled last month that Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail at a facility near New Orleans. Durst was featured this spring in \"The Jinx,\" a HBO documentary about him. He's accused of killing his friend  Susan Berman at her home in California in 2000. He also faces state weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans. Last month, court documents claimed that Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash. He also had a UPS tracking number. The package was intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said, and it contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. But the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last month. He awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of \"lying in wait\" and killing Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she \"was a witness to a crime.\" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. It's not the first time he has been accused of murder. He admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. DeGuerin has said Durst has serious medical conditions. He is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said. \"At the same time he was in the hospital, he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,\" DeGuerin said. DeGuerin also said that Durst is \"mildly autistic\" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism.",

    "document": "Bayern Munich cruised to a 6-1 victory against Champion's League rivals Porto last night. . But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto. The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' . Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? . Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. . Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend. And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight. The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit. King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy. The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. . Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. . 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip…from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' . High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013. A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one.  . 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' . Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. . Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. . Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. . What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. . 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! .

But Derek Murray, a University of Alberta law student, found more than just the note that cold November day in Edmonton--he also found an extension cord and battery charger left by the stranger to bring his dead Acura back to life. Now that Murray's life-affirming tale has now gone viral, he says 'It just shows you how such a pure act of kindness from one person can just spread through everyone and help make everyone’s day a little brighter.' Good Samaritan: A friendly stranger left this unbelievably friendly letter to Alberta law student Derek Murray in order to help him get his car started after he left the headlights on all day. At first, though, he assumed the letter was from an angry fellow motorist, he told the National Post. . 'When I first saw the note, I was expecting it to be an angry letter from someone telling me not to park there. Instead, I got someone just totally brightening my day. My day could have been ruined but, because of this guy, it was the highlight of my day.' The note reads, in part:. I noticed you left your lights on. The battery will probably not have enough charge to start your vehicle. I left a blue extension cord on the fence and a battery charger beside the fence in the cardboard box. If you know how to hook it up, use it to start your car. What followed was a detailed explanation of how to use the equipment. 'Sure enough,' Derek recalled to the National Post, 'I looked over at the house my car was parked beside, and there was a blue extension cord plugged into an outlet behind the guy’s house with a battery charger right there beside it.' Derek was able to get his car started, but when he rang the good Samaritan's doorbell, there was no answer. So, Derek left his own note as a thank you for the kind gesture. . He later snapped a photo of the stranger's friendly note to post to Facebook, where it has now gone viral. The note has been viewed millions of times and even Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson retweeted the photo.

    "document": "The leader of Kazakhstan has apologised after winning the presidential election with 97 per cent of the vote saying it would have been 'undemocratic' for him to make his victory more modest. Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 74-year-old former steel worker who has ruled the oil-producing nation since 1989, has won another five year term. Kazakh television showed a triumphant Nazarbayev walking on a red carpet, smiling and shaking hands and greeting thousands of jubilant supporters at a forum in the capital Astana. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been re-elected as president of Kazakhstan after winning 97 per cent of the vote. But international monitors have voiced their concern about the poll saying there was not a genuine choice of other candidates with most of his vocal opponents either being jailed or fled abroad. However, at a news conference, Nazarbayev said: 'I apologise that for super-democratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. 'If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?' The election was called more than a year before Nazarbayev's term was due to end, averting the risk that another year of economic pain could develop into a more serious challenge to his leadership. It also puts the question of a possible successor, an important issue for investors, off the table for now. Kazakhstan has been criticised by the West and human rights bodies for crackdowns on dissent. No election held there has yet been given a clean bill of health by monitors. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping promptly congratulated Nazarbayev on his re-election. Nazarbayev told a news conference after his victory that if he had interfered in the vote, it would have been undemocratic . Meanwhile Nazarbayev has promoted market reforms in the country and attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment, turning his nation of 17 million into the second-largest economy in the former Soviet Union and number two post-Soviet oil producer after Russia. The multi-ethnic, mainly Muslim country is stable in a region troubled by ethnic violence from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan. Nazarbayev has promoted 'a multi-vector policy', building good ties with neighbouring Russia and China as well as the United States and the European Union. But the economy has been hurt in the past year by the decline in global energy prices and by economic difficulty in neighbouring Russia, hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine. Kazakh economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.5 percent this year from a 4.3 percent rise in 2014. Gross domestic product may actually shrink if oil prices drop to below $50 per barrel, Kazakh officials have said.  .",

Police in Manchester have now issued a warning to parents over the game, known as 'sleeper', which officers say is potentially fatal. The child's details have not been release but a Greater Manchester Police spokesman said the child is believed to have had underlying health problems and is expected to make a full recovery. Officers from Greater Manchester Police have been forced to issue a warning on Facebook (pictured) after an eight-year-old boy was hospitalised after a playground suffocation prank called 'sleeper' went wrong.

    "document": "It was another momentous night in Barcelona's proud European history, Neymar and Luis Suarez rampaging through Paris Saint-Germain's defence to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals. Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992. Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie. Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta. However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. . Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp. Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. . Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. . They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. . Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000. Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. . They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. . The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. . Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal. Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009. Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. . Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. . Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United. Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. . With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. . Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. . Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. . Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011. Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. . Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United. Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. . Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. . Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. . The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar. Messi converts from the penalty spot in Barcelona's 2-0 win at Manchester City last season. 22 goals - AC Milan. 18 - Celtic, Chelsea. 17 - Manchester United, Bayer Leverkusen, Arsenal. 16 - Panathinaikos, Lyon. 14 - Galatasaray. 13 - Shakhtar Donetsk, Spartak Moscow, Paris Saint-Germain. 10 - Ajax, Stutgart. 9 - Porto, BATE Borisov. 8 - Sporting Lisbon, Werder Bremen, Newcastle United . 75 - Lionel Messi. 22 - Rivaldo. 20 - Patrick Kluivert. 19 - Luis Enrique. 16 - Samuel Eto'o. 15 - Pedro. 14 - Ronaldinho. 11 - Javier Saviola, Xavi. 10 - Andres Iniesta. 8 - Neymar, Thierry Henry, Hristo Stoichkov, David Villa. 7 - Luis Figo, Gerard Pique, own goals.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .",

    "document": "The scene in the Old Government House Hotel could not be further removed from the horrors of war. There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served, a clink of cutlery on crockery, the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups. Somewhere outside, the clouds part and light floods the lounge. I reach for another scone, ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream, and marvel that, in this context, 70 years seems an eternity. Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey's only five-star hotel – pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port – would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere. Seventy years on: St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945), this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters. Invading officers would have stalked its corridors. By April 1945, they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin, and the Channel Islands – bypassed by the D-Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation. That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month – and with gusto. The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival (3 April–11 May) is a five-week hurrah of history, parades, concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago – Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, Herm and Sark. This is no small feat. Fiercely individual, the islands have never before combined to stage a big event. But here they have common cause. Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey's capital St Helier into swirls of people and music. It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey's harrowing half-decade. The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline – the swarthy, sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north. Intrigued, I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower, on the south-west shore. It is an oddly unnerving experience, the pillar-box slots in the bastion's sides eyeing me quietly. When I face the water, I almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine-gun barrel on my neck. Coastal curves: Guernsey's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of Portelet Bay. You can go further into Guernsey's wartime heritage. What appears to be a car park behind La Colinette Hotel on the western outskirts of St Peter Port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the Channel Islands. Hidden down a damp flight of stairs, the former German Naval Signals Headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there. This, of course, was the point. Its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter, semaphore murmur and serious conversation. German signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls. The bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival – its secrets brought into the light. The German Occupation Museum at Les Houards offers further perspective, flitting from frivolity to fear – on one hand the photo album of Freda Oliver, a local girl who dated (and married) a German officer; on the other, exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island's Jewish population, and copies of the Guernsey Evening Press turned to propaganda sheet. The darkness of life under Nazi rule is most obvious at the German Military Underground Hospital, at La Vassalerie. This enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave-labour sweat of prisoners of war – plenty of whom died in the process. As did many of the injured German troops brought here from France after the D-Day landings. With its dank passages and horror-film ambience, the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building. An island guardian: Mont Orgueil Castle has protected the east coast of Jersey since the 13th century. The picture is replicated 27 miles to the south-east. Jersey is a short hop from Guernsey – around an hour by fast ferry, less by air. Here, the Jersey War Tunnels – another military-medical complex – have been restored into something less frightening, with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels. The side-effects of occupation can be seen here – the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies. But so can the joy that liberation brought. Glorious video footage shows euphoria in St Helier as the news of German surrender broke; the Union Jack being hoisted at the Pomme D'Or Hotel. The hotel came to symbolise the Channel Islands' moment of deliverance. In a way, it still does, peering across what is now called Liberation Square, where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag – laughing, as if they are flying a kite. Other echoes resound across St Helier. The Jersey Museum and Art Gallery has a catalogue of copies of the Jersey Evening Post dating back 125 years, its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail (albeit through a fog of strict German control). The nearby Maritime Museum proffers the Occupation Tapestry Gallery – a montage of bright images, stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995, which depict Jersey brought to heel – armed troops in the streets, the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire. And the Jersey Archive is host to a remarkable resource – over 30,000 of the Occupation Registration Cards which were forced on islanders by the Nazi authorities. There are no smiles here – just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces. Bright days ahead: A view of the pretty coastal enclave of Gorey from the ramparts of Mont Orgueil Castle. The heaviness of the German bootprint is perhaps summed up by Battery Lothringen – a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite. This colossal bunker – which will also be accessible during the festival – 'protected' St Helier from the far side of St Aubin's Bay. The stairs into its depths seem to go down forever, to gun posts, control rooms and sleeping quarters – the decades peeling away as I walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy. And yet, just seven miles north-west, it all feels like a bad dream. St Brelade's Bay Hotel gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner. In the summer of 1940, it was another German outpost, requisitioned as a hang-out by Luftwaffe pilots. It is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted. Over breakfast, I peer out of the wide restaurant windows – at waves rolling gently up to the beach, and at St Brelade's, a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand. There is no stomp of marching boots this morning – but for five weeks, the Channel Islands are remembering a time when there was.

One of the main things I preach to my girls, ages 7 and 9, is the importance of respecting other people, no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish. It's something that my husband and I just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the President of the United States. Let me say right here that I have lost my cool from time to time, whether it's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant. In those cases, when I feel like I'm going to pop, I keep saying, \"This is unacceptable, This is unacceptable,\" and either hang up in disgust or storm off.

Some of McHenry's comments, such as how she's \"on television,\" imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she, by dint of her career, education and income, is better than people who don't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities. McHenry showed that she either forgot those \"golden rule\" lessons from childhood or that she hasn't really lived her life with that mantra. McHenry has since apologized on Twitter, saying she said \"some insulting and regrettable things,\" and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in Virginia,  she should \"always choose to be respectful and take the high road.\" But it's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker. \"I see this Britt McHenry video, and think: it's not just about how a celebrity shouldn't act in public, it's how all of us shouldn't act,\" wrote \"Cait\" on Twitter. Said \"Shannon,\" also on Twittter, \"I had no idea who Britt McHenry was before but ... now I know she's the kind of woman I hope I've taught my daughters not to be.\" \"Her language and disdain brings shame on her, her profession, and her employer. People don't all of sudden have such a vile tirade. This comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors. Let's let her be an example to others,\" wrote C Cooper on a Change.org petition asking McHenry's employers to fire her. The McHenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her. This morning, I told her McHenry was suspended for a week by ESPN, and that led to another conversation. My kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to \"treat other people the way you would want them to treat you\" even in uncomfortable moments. Celebrity apologies: The good, bad and uncomfortable. So, Britt McHenry, check out these examples of how the rich, famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity. After British journalist Katie Hopkins seriously fat-shamed pop music star Kelly Clarkson, saying a host of insulting things about the singer's weight, Clarkson won praise for her graceful response. \"That's because she doesn't know me. I'm awesome. It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think,\" she said. A college baseball player gets suspended for calling Little League baseball phenom Mo'ne Davis a \"slut.\" Her response? She emailed Bloomsburg University asking that the college reinstate him. \"Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance,\" Davis, the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in Little League World Series history, told ESPN. \"... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more.\" When an Argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to Pope Francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country's president ahead of the general election in October and possibly influencing the outcome, what did the Pope do? Well, he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call. Wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation! The pope appears to have been more than graceful, because after the conversation, the journalist pledged to learn how to pray. When Queen Bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip-synching the national anthem in honor of President Obama's inauguration in 2013, she didn't come out swinging. Instead, she admitted to singing along with her \"pre-recorded track\" at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring, a cappella rendition of the national anthem. Finally, Reese Witherspoon may be the closest example for McHenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode. When Witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence, the Academy Award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as, \"Do you know who I am?\" and \"You're about to find out who I am.\" She ultimately issued an apologetic statement, and then went on morning television to apologize some more. \"We went out to dinner in Atlanta, and we had one too many glasses of wine, and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not,\" she said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"It's completely unacceptable, and we are so sorry and embarrassed. We know better, and we shouldn't have done that.\" And, she added, \"When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure,\" she told the GMA host . Now, did McHenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry, you never berate them for their weight, job, appearance and income? Let's hope so. Can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect?

The French winger, 32, has won four Bundesliga titles as well as a Champions League during his time with the German giants, but it could have all been different had a proposed move to the Bernabeu in 2009 gone through. Real wanted Ribery after he fell out with then-Bayern head coach Louis van Gaal, though he says he was convinced to stay after being sold on his importance by the club's elite.

Ribery fell out with then-head coach Louis van Gaal and says Real were willing to pay for him. 'I had intensive talks with Uli Hoeness, who was still president back then, and chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge,' Ribery told Goal. 'They told me I should not go, how the club needed me, how I was as important for Bayern as Lionel Messi was for Barcelona. 'Real tried, they wanted me. I don't know what price Bayern wanted them to pay. In the end I am happy how it ended.' As well as enjoying the collective success with Bayern, Ribery also picked up UEFA awards after his performances during the Champions League-winning campaign in 2012/13.

    "document": "Luke Rockhold staked his claim in New Jersey as the top middleweight contender in the UFC. Up next, Rockhold wants a title shot and a shot at MMA history in New York. Rockhold capped a brief and brilliant appearance in the cage with a rear naked choke at 2:32 of the second round and made Lyoto Machida tap to win a main event showdown between two of the top middleweights in UFC on Saturday night. Luke Rockhold beat Lyoto Machida by second-round submission in New Jersey. Rockhold celebrates his victory and now wants a shot at the middleweight title . 'I am the No 1 contender,' Rockhold said. 'I'm the best guy around.' Rockhold should be next in line for a pay-per-view title shot in the 185-pound division. With a dominant win over the 36-year-old Machida, he positioned himself to take on the winner of the UFC 187 fight next month between Chris Weidman and Vitor Belfort. Machida never put up much of a fight in his brief stint in the cage. Rockhold lost on his UFC debut in 2013, then rebounded with wins over Costas Philippou, Tim Boetsch, Michael Bisping. He won his third straight fight via submission and looked at his best at the Prudential Center. 'I did my part,' Rockhold said. 'Weidman, you're going to do your part. Let's take this across the way. Madison Square Garden, let's make history.' Rockhold was dominant from the first bell as he cruised to victory against Machida. Machida was marked up badly after the first round and didn't last long in the second session. MMA would have to become legalized in New York for that bout to happen. The Senate again approved a bill to legalize and regulate the combat sport that includes boxing, judo, wrestling and kickboxing. UFC remained hopeful that the assembly will finally approve the bill that would allow the promotion to stage a dream card in December at MSG. 'If it doesn't happen, it'll be crazy,' UFC President Dana White said. Jacare Souza, the No 1 ranked middleweight, made short work of Chris Camozzi in the co-main event. Souza won with an armbar submission at 2:33 of the first round. Jacare Souza (right) grapples with Chris Camozzi on his way to victory in the first round. Souza needed less than five minutes to earn victory and also wants a middleweight title shot. Souza, who lost to Rockhold in his Strikeforce days, hoped he could earn a shot at Weidman's title with a fight against Olympic silver medalist Yoel Romero. But when Romero was injured, Camozzi stepped in on short notice - and a shorter fight. Souza won his eighth straight UFC fight and hoped a month ago a win would mean his name would get called next for a middleweight title fight. Machida-Rockhold and Souza-Romero would have been a Final Four showcase of the best of the UFC middleweight contenders. But Romero's last-minute scratch meant Souza likely has a longer wait for the biggest fight of his UFC career. 'I want to get the shot at the title next,' Souza said. 'It's my time. I'm coming off five victories.' .  .",

Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond.

Nicky Clark celebrates after putting Rangers 1-0 up against Raith Rovers on Sunday. Clark in the air as he heads the ball towards goal to give the hosts the lead at Ibrox. Rangers manager Stuart McCall applauds the home fans after the full-time whistle. The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference. Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert. But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes.

The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart. Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards. Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go.

    "document": "Mad Men star Jon Hamm's secret college bullying shame has been exposed by court documents unearthed from the actor's time at the University of Texas at Austin. According to shocking arrest warrants and summons seen by Star magazine, the 44-year-old Golden Globe winner allegedly set fire to one pledge after viciously beating him and using a claw hammer to drag him by his genitals during a hazing ritual gone wrong. The documents claim that Hamm, 44, was eventually charged with assault in connection with the sadistic November 1990 initiation, but he managed to get the charges dismissed before he began his ascent to superstardom. Scroll down for video . College student: Jon Hamm is pictured here in the University of Texas at Austin yearbook for 1990 (left) - the same year he was allegedly involved in a hazing scandal at the Sigma Nu fraternity. The actor is pictured (right) this week. According to the explosive court documents, Hamm was in his sophomore year at UT-Austin when a prospective 21-year-old pledge was called to the Sigma Nu house at 2.30am. When he got there, according to Travis County Court documents, Hamm - who was then aged 20 - and other frat brothers ominously told him, 'It's going to be a long night!' The unidentified junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity. The alleged victim told police that Hamm and other members hit him with a paddle 30 times and then lifted the pledge off the floor by his underwear, 'pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion', causing 'great pain'. The pledged then claimed that Hamm led him to a basement 'Pit' where he slammed the junior's face into the ground while he was doing push-ups and then allegedly stood on his spine with his full weight. Shockingly, after this, Hamm is then supposed to have set fire to the pledge's pants and refused to let him pat the flames down, but instead made him blow them out. Shame: The allegedly assault saw Hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to a 21-year-old pledge and beat him with a paddle. At the end of the vicious hazing ritual, the pledge was taken to a part of the frat house called the 'Party Room' where Hamm 'hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his genitals and led him by the hammer around the room'. Allegedly not content with this, Hamm then went onto to break into another potential pledge's room that night and subjected him to a similar torturous initiation. However, the morning after, the mother of the first pledge was called to his room to find him 'hiding in a closet at his apartment, his buttocks and legs black with brusises.' Despit pleading with his mother not to go public, saying 'They'll come kill me!', she reported the incident to the police. High school senior: These pictures of Jon Hamm are from 1989, the year he graduated from John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri and one year before his admission to University of Texas at Austin. Early career:  Jon Hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show The Big Date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident . Huge hit: Man Men and the character of Don Draper has given Jon Hamm his biggest role to date - winning a Golden Globe for his work on the AMC series. Eight warrants were issued for Hamm and seven other frat members, which was shut down for a time after the alleged incident. Three members of Sigma Nu were sentenced to 30 days in prison for the hazing ritual and Hamm was eventually hit with hazing and assault charges in 1991. In the wake of the hazing incident, the Sigma Nu fraternity was shut down in 1990 after the pledge's mother made her son's alleged assault public by going to the police. . In 1990, the AP reported that Sigma NU would close and that seven students were being punished after pledges were 'physically and psychologically attacked'. The-then national president of Sigma Nu, James Cherry, said that he was revoking the charter of its UT-Austin, saying, 'Basically, we're out of business on this campus'. 'But our fraternity was founded in opposition to hazing in 1869 and we will not tolerate any form of hazing today.' A warrant was issued for Hamm's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed. He returned home to live with his family in Missouri and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30-day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career. A friend told Star that although shocking, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.' Hazing incident: Following the alleged assault of the 21-year-old pledge, the Sigma Nu fraternity at UT-Austin (pictured) was shut down . Recently, the Mad Men star has admitted that playing the complex role of Don Draper has taken its toll. In an interview he gave just weeks before he checked himself into rehab last month for 30 days, Hamm opened up about the effect that playing Madison Avenue ad man Don Draper had on his psyche. The 44-year-old star told Variety: 'Playing this guy does not come without its own difficulties, it’s not fun to live in this guy’s headspace year after year.' He added: 'People ask, \"What’s the difference between you and Don?\" Look, I drink, I get drunk. I’m not immune to that,. 'And (creator) Matt (Weiner) will tell you, the darkness in Don has not abated, it’s gotten worse year after year. It’s relentless. And it can be hard on you as a person. I love coming to work; I love the people I work with. But it’s been rough.' As he reflected on being offered similar roles and being typecast as the dark, brooding, alcoholic womanizing character, Jon revealed he wants to distance himself from that persona.",

The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James’s Palace, saying: ‘We are going to do something new this evening. ‘The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it’s her 25th birthday today.’. Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved. Andrew told her: ‘You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).’.

    "document": "Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League's Easter weekend fixtures and the race for promotion across the Football League. 1. Playing Jordan Henderson as a wing back instead of in his normal central midfield position was an idea that went spectacularly wrong for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. . The England star, who has taken over the captain’s armband in the absence of Steven Gerrard, gave the ball away 23 times in 90 minutes as he struggled to handle the role at Arsenal. . Jordan Henderson (left) toiled as a wing back in Liverpool's defeat against Arsenal and lost the ball 23 times. Henderson, usually a central midfielder, has not given the ball away as much all season for Liverpool. There hasn’t been a single one of his previous 29 Premier League appearances this season in which he’s lost possession more. 2. John O’Shea has clearly learned the canny defender’s art of letting his brain do all the running. The theory is if you get in the right position in the first place, you don’t have to chase to recover. In 90 minutes of helping Sunderland keep a clean sheet against Newcastle, the Ireland international logged just 11.9 metres at sprint speed on the EA Sports performance data. It clearly works for him – he’ll be 34 at the end of this month but remains the sole Premier League outfield player to have appeared in every minute of every game in all competitions for his club this season. . John O'Shea only sprinted 11.9 metres during his impressive display in Sunderland's 1-0 win over Newcastle. O'Shea (third left) celebrated Sunderland's win with Costel Pantilimon when the final whistle was blown. For good measure he’s also completed the full 90 minutes of all five European Championship qualifiers for the Republic. 3. Steven Caulker’s form has suffered from playing with too many different partners at QPR but there are signs the former Spurs and Cardiff centre half is returning to his best. . The 23-year-old was a towering figure as a West Brom side led by the powerful figure of substitute Victor Anichebe fought to recover from being three goals down at half-time. . Steven Caulker (right) wins a header against West Bromwich Albion striker Brown Ideye. Caulker made 20 clearances – as many as the rest of the Rangers back four put together – and more than any other Premier League defender all weekend. 4. Chelsea need have few fears if Diego Costa’s hamstring problems mean they have to rely on Loic Remy for goals in the last eight games of the season. . The France international’s tap-in from Eden Hazard’s pass for the winner against Stoke was his fifth Premier League goal of the season from just 456 minutes on the pitch. Loic Remy (centre) scored Chelsea's winner in their 2-1 victory over Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Remy could be vital to Chelsea as they look to win the Premier League title after Diego Costa went off injured. That’s a goal every 91 minutes – actually a better ratio than Costa whose 19 Premier League goals have come at the rate of one every 103 minutes. 5. Burnley boss Sean Dyche has talked about stability all season and continues to practise what he preaches. . He picked an unchanged side for the 16th time this season for the home clash with Tottenham and was rewarded with a valuable point. . Sean Dyche selected an unchanged side for the 16th time as Burnley drew 0-0 with Tottenham on Sunday. That’s more than double the number of times any other club has kept the same starting XI – next highest is Leicester with seven. 6. Kasper Schmeichel looked to have lost his first-team place at Leicester a few weeks ago following the arrival from Chelsea of veteran Mark Schwarzer. . But the 28-year-old son of Manchester United legend Peter returned for the 4-3 defeat at Tottenham just before the international break, and justified Nigel Pearson’s decision to keep him in the side with a brilliant display in the 2-1 win over West Ham. . Kasper Schmeichel made a string of outstanding stops as Leicester beat West Ham 2-1. Schmeichel made six saves as well as several vital catches – the only time he has made more saves in a game this season was the eight at Chelsea back in August that stopped a 2-0 defeat becoming a rout. 7. Swansea boss Garry Monk shared the club’s rise from football’s basement to the Premier League as a player, and isn’t afraid to back his belief there are more in League Two with the potential to play at the top. . He put his club’s money where his mouth is by signing Matt Grimes from Exeter for £1.75million in January, and has now given the 19-year-old his debut in the top flight. . Matt Grimes (right) impressed in his substitute appearance for Swansea in the 3-1 win against Hull . It wasn’t a bad little cameo, either. Swansea scored their third in the 3-1 win over Hull barely a minute after Grimes came on. 8. Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer left striker Jordan Rhodes out of his starting side for the 0-0 FA Cup quarter-final at Liverpool – but surely can’t drop him again for Wednesday’s replay. . The 25-year-old Scotland international is in the best scoring form of even his prolific career after netting the second of the 3-0 win at Leeds. It was his eighth goal in the last 12 games for Blackburn and took his total for the season to 17 from 35 Championship starts. Jordan Rhodes (right) scores Blackburn's second goal against Leeds in the Championship on Saturday. 9. Boyhood Hearts fan Jason Holt admitted he was upset at missing out on the celebrations when his old club clinched top spot in the Scottish Championship a few weeks ago. . But the midfielder who moved to Sheffield United in January might yet be able to open some bubbly with his new club after scoring in the 2-0 derby win at Barnsley. . It was the 22-year-old's third in as many games and gave Nigel Clough’s side a seven-point cushion for a place in the League One play-off zone. Midfielder Jason Holt (left) is proving important to Sheffield United's hopes of going up a division. John Akinde celebrates scoring for Barnet, where he has found the net 30 times in the league this season. 10. John Akinde has a peculiar place in the football history books for being the first player sold by an internet vote of fans – he was a promising teenager at Ebbsfleet in 2008 when the online poll decided to let him move to Bristol City. . The striker’s move never worked out – but seven years and nine clubs later he’s setting records again and this time for much better reasons. . His finish against Nuneaton that took Barnet back to the top of the Vanarama Conference was his 30th League goal of the season, equalling Gary Bull’s club record set in 1991. .  .",

Pot plants without soil spillage. When repotting a plant from the nursery, pop a coffee filter at the bottom of the new pot so that soil doesn’t leak out on the floor. This is especially useful for house plants. 18. Composting . Place a filter at the bottom of your kitchen compost pot so that there are no leakages or spills. Simply empty the whole lot out the next time you are adding to your compost pile. 19. Polish your shoes. Coffee filters are perfect for polishing leather shoes as they are lint-free and so won’t leave unsightly streak marks on your shoes.

    "document": "The Tulsa County reserve deputy who fatally shot a man instead of using his Taser turned himself in to authorities Tuesday at the Tulsa County Jail. Video shows Reserve Deputy Robert Bates announcing he is going to deploy his Taser after an undercover weapons sting on April 2 but then shooting Eric Courtney Harris in the back with a handgun. Bates was charged with second-degree manslaughter Monday. He surrendered Tuesday morning, accompanied by his attorney, Clark Brewster, and immediately posted bail of $25,000. As he exited the jailhouse, Bates paused in front of television cameras for a moment but did not speak. His attorney reiterated that he believes the charge against his client is unwarranted. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says a sting operation caught Harris illegally selling a gun. Harris ran when officers came in for the arrest. Authorities say Bates thought he pulled out his Taser but \"inadvertently\" fired his gun. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, told CNN that he is pleased District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler pressed charges. In his opinion, however, no type of force should have been used in the arrest of his brother. Watching the video of the shooting, Andre Harris said he can see that three or more officers were already on top of his brother. That manpower should have been enough to arrest him, he said. \"It was a situation where I didn't necessarily think that a Taser should even be used,\" Andre Harris said. Scott Wood, another Bates' attorney, has said the shooting was an \"excusable homicide.\" Investigators' efforts to defend Bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online. Harris' relatives are demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality. They're also questioning why the 73-year-old Bates -- the CEO of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high-risk sting operation. Daniel Smolen, an attorney representing the Harris family, said Bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time. Bates, who was a police officer for a year in the 1960s, had been a reserve deputy since 2008, with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience, according to the sheriff's office. He was also a frequent contributor to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, including $2,500 to the re-election of Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The sheriff's office has said that Bates had law enforcement certification, but Smolen said he has not seen any field training records. \"We're holding up all right at this point,\" Andre Harris said. \"We're putting our faith in God that justice will be served, and we can get some closure in this situation.\" How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? In a statement released Tuesday, Eric Harris' family members said they know there are many good deputies working in Tulsa County. \"However, the treatment of Eric of April 2 clearly shows that there is a deep-seated problem within the TCSO,\" the statement said. The family said that the sheriff has not apologized and that the department has not shown remorse or indication it will change its policies. CNN's Jason Morris and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.",

Jose Mourinho's side struggled to get into their rhythm and had Thibaut Courtois to thank, following a series of impressive saves to deny Charlie Austin and Matt Phillips. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... . Queens Park Rangers. Rob Green - His dreadful kick led to Chelsea's late winner. Not a moment he'll want to remember in hurry. 5.5. Mauricio Isla - Tasked with taming the interchanging Hazard and Willian and kept at his task admirably. 6.5. Steven Caulker - Alongside Onuoha, the defender dealt with Drogba's threat excellently. 7. Nedum Onuoha - Strong display from the versatile defender, who now looks at home at centre-back. 7. Nedum Onuoha (15) performed well at the back for QPR and kept Didier Drogba quiet throughout. Clint Hill - Showed tremendous desire at left-back and did well to combat both Willian and Hazard. 7. Matt Phillips - Has shone in recent weeks for Rangers and caused Chelsea problems with his pace. 6.5. Joey Barton - Hurried and hassled Chelsea's midfield. Typical energy from the controversial midfielder. 6.5. Joey Barton (centre) put in a good shift for the home side and made life difficult for Chelsea's midfield. Matt Phillips (right) came close to scoring for QPR but his shot was brilliantly saved by Courtois. Sandro - Put a real shift in for Rangers and showed moments of quality, too. Denied a goal by Courtois' brilliance. 6.5. Karl Henry - His defensive instincts were vital as QPR tried to stem Chelsea's attacking flow. 6.5. Bobby Zamora - No wondergoal this week, but his experience was just as important in this west London derby. 6.5. Charlie Austin - Caused Chelsea problems with his clever movement and went close on a couple of occasions. 6.5. Subs. Niko Kranjcar 6 (for Sandro 81) Junior Hoilett 5.5 (for Zamora 83); Richard Dunne (for Isla 90) Chris Ramsey - 6.5. Charlie Austin (left) nearly scored a spectacular effort in the first half but the Chelsea keeper denied him. Chelsea. Thibaut Courtois - The busier of the two keepers; produced a brilliant save in the second to deny Phillips. 7.5. Branislav Ivanovic - Looked comfortable for much of the afternoon as opponent Henry showed little attacking intent. 6.5. Gary Cahill - Stood up to the physical battle with Austin and Zamora with minimal fuss. 6.5. The Belgian goalkeeper was Chelsea's stand-out performer with a number of crucial saves . John Terry - An unpopular figure at Loftus Road, but stood firm under hostilities from the home crowd. 7. Cesar Azpilicueta - The left-back was kept busy by Phillips down QPR's right, but emerged with plenty credit. 7. Ramires - Had little impact in midfield and was hauled off by Mourinho early in the second half. 5. Nemanja Matic - Has had far better afternoons but, as ever, offered a solid-enough shield to his back-four. 6. Cesar Azpilicueta (left) kept QPR's dangerous attackers quiet and was good going forward to join the attack. Cesc Fabregas - The masked midfielder was off-key all afternoon before popping up with the winner. 6.5. Willian - Tireless as ever down both Chelsea flanks, but couldn't help his side break down resolute Rangers. 6.5. Eden Hazard - A quieter than usual afternoon for the Belgian, but still provided a telling contribution for the winner. 6. Didier Drogba - Handed a rare start with Remy and Costa missing through injury, but had little impact on proceedings. 6. Subs:. Oscar 6 (for Ramires, 56); Juan Cuadrado 5.5 (for Willian 80); Kurt Zouma (for Fabregas) Jose Mourinho - 6.5. Man of the Match: Courtois . Cesc Fabregas (right) slotted home the winner after good work from Eden Hazard and Oscar. Hazard (right) had a fairly quiet afternoon but provided the assist for Fabregas to win the clash.",

    "document": "The man who threw a banana peel at Dave Chappelle on Monday night denies he is racist, claiming it was 'just a joke'. Defending his actions, Christian Englander added that he threw another at a second black man just two days later - insisting that was also a joke. 'I'm sorry that my joke was misconstrued as a racial attack on Dave Chappelle,' the 30-year-old artist told The Albuquerque Journal. . The second, he threw because the 'irony of this situation is too much to pass up'. Englander was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct and battery during Chapelle's show in New Mexico. On Thursday, he claims to have hurled another banana peel at a man who confronted him about the first attack outside a Santa Fe bar. . Scroll down for video. Struck again: Christian Englander, 30, has thrown a banana peel at a black man for the second time in one week. He was arrested on Monday for hurling one at Dave Chappelle. On Thursday he struck again at a bar. Not amused: Santa Fe police say a man tossed a banana peel at Dave Chappelle during a show in New Mexico Monday, hitting in the comedian in the leg. Here Chappelle performs last summer. Chappelle was performing a comedy routine at the Lensic theater in Santa Fe when a banana peel struck him . According to Englander, his first attack came after Chappelle mocked his friend's name 'Johnny Appleseed'. . Police said the 30-year-old, from Santa Fe, appeared to be drunk as he sat near the stage. . According to TMZ, Englander thought Chappelle's quips were racist, so he decided to throw the peel, which he had in his pocket. . He had allegedly eaten the banana at a convenience store before the show, and washed it down with a shot of the alcoholic beverage 99 Bananas. After the attack, he was escorted out of the venue. On Thursday, he became embroiled in a fight with a man called Jay Wills, Oregon Live reports. Wills was allegedly upset about Englander's attack on Chappelle, and the two engaged in a heated argument, which was not reported to the police. . Englander has not been charged with the reported attack. . Racial attack: Chappelle told police Englander did not seem remorseful, and he believed the banana attack was racially motivated . Englander was in jail Tuesday, and Dobyns said she didn't know whether he has an attorney to speak on his behalf. Chappelle has had his share of run-ins with audience members in the past. Fueled up: Englander said he ate the banana and washed it down with a shot of 99 Bananas liquor before the show . In a 2013 gig in Hartford, Connecticut, Chappelle shut down his act after 10 minutes because of heckling. Known for his sharp commentary on race relations in America, Chappelle has gradually resumed his stand-up career in the past two years, making a long-awaited return after abruptly abandoning a popular Comedy Central show in 2005. Court documents indicate that following his arrest Monday night, Christian Englander 'appeared unapologetic and made several statements that appeared to be racially motivated.’. A criminal complaint cited by the Albuquerque Journal states that while smiling and laughing, Englander said: 'maybe I should have handed you [Chappelle] the banana instead.' Chappelle told police it seemed that his attacker was not remorseful and that the banana toss was 'racially motivated,' according to the complaint. The 41-year-old comedian indicated that he wanted to press charges against Englander. Once Englander was removed from the venue, Chappelle resumed his routine but spent the remainer of his set harping on the fruit fracas. ‘First I'm going to kill him with my comedy then I'm going to kick him in his f***ing face,’ he said, according to an audio recording made by an audience member and shared online. ‘By the way, these are empty threats.’. He later expressed a desire to hurl a tuna casserole in his assailant's face and to choke the life out of him - but noted that he wouldn't do it because it's against the law. The famed comedian took issue with the fact that the fruit hurled at him was not even fresh and marveled at the fact that someone would carry a banana peel in their pocket. ‘Why didn't he throw a good banana at me? Just the brown peel? Where's the rest of it? I am actually offended by the poor quality of the banana. It was brown, man,’ he was quoted as saying by the news blog NewsCastic. . But the pugnacious performer said he was not surprised that it happened to him. ‘I wish I could be, “I can't believe this is happening,” but in all honestly, I've been expecting that banana for many years,’ Chappelle told the crowd. ‘I just didn't know tonight was going to be the night.' The former Comedy Central star also used the incident to gently rib the popular comedy duo Key and Peele, who currently have a sketch show on the cable network. ‘Key and Peele probably did that s***,’ he joked, referring to the banana throw. ‘Key and Banana Peel.’. Chappelle is expected to carry on his comedy tour, performing a show in El Paso, Texas, Tuesday night.   . Not impressed: The famed comedian took issue with the fact that the fruit hurled at him was not even fresh.  .",

    "document": "A 17-year-old boy who was shot dead from behind by a police officer had just stolen a handgun, according to the police department in question. Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon. 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him. Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet. In the wake of his death, Howell's mother LaToya told Fox News her son 'couldn't have been a threat'. She said: 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police'. . 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' Peet appeared in court Monday on two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He is being held on a $15,000 bond. . Dumyahn said the Zion Police Department was releasing the narrative from the shooting because media outlets had linked Peet's case to the shooting. He said the department has 'no desire to defame the deceased'. Courts: Peet appeared in court Monday charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. Claim: Zion Police chief Steve Dumyahn said the department had 'no desire to defame' Howell, but released the details because media outlets realized his case and Peet's are connected. Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. . He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. . Witherspoon added: 'Here in America we are seeing this with too many brown and black boys.' Zion is a community of about 24,000 people along Lake Michigan, 45 miles north of Chicago, near Illinois' border with Wisconsin. Howell was a high school junior who transferred from a school in Wisconsin to Waukegan Public School District 60.  .",

    "document": "Tom Varndell helped himself to a hat-trick against London Welsh as Wasps won away from home in the Aviva Premiership for the first time in 2015 to keep their top-six hopes alive. Ahead of the trip to the Kassam Stadium, Wasps' hunt for an automatic European Rugby Champions Cup spot next season had stuttered after winning just one of their previous five fixtures in all competitions. However, they claimed a 40-13 win over Welsh with tries from Varndell, Ashley Johnson, Sailosi Tagicakibau and Alapati Leiua. Tom Varndell crosses for one of his three tries as Wasps ran out comfortable winners at the Kassam Stadium. It was far from plain sailing for Wasps, though as the Exiles, whose defeat to Bath last time out confirmed that they will finish bottom of the table, trailed 12-5 at half-time after Opeti Fonua bundled over after the first two of Varndell's tries. But Johnson dotted down and Varndell added his third before Tagicakibau secured the bonus point for Wasps, with Alapati Leiua getting in on the act with the last play of the game. Chris Elder scored Welsh's second try of the match in the second period. Wasps got off to a fast start at the Kassam as they went 12 points clear after as many minutes. The visitors found the tryline after only four minutes as Varndell broke down the right flank and scored in the corner, veteran fly-half Andy Goode converting well from a tight angle. Welsh then went down to 14 men eight minutes later when Koree Britton was sent to the sin bin for pulling down a maul and Wasps instantly capitalised as Varndell grabbed his second try. Seb Stegmann is tackled by Carlo Festuccia as the exiles put up a fight, but faded away again. Alapati Leiua breaks away to score a late try as Wasps pulled away in the closing stages . The Exiles crept back into the game, though, keeping the pressure on Wasps' defence and Fonua forced his way through to make it 12-5, Tristan Roberts kicking the conversion side. Welsh started the second half well and Roberts made amends for his earlier miss as he calmly kicked a penalty between the posts to reduce the arrears even further. But Wasps soon began to dominate and a lineout close to the try-line was bundled over by Johnson in his first start as hooker. Then a swift break down the right saw Varndell free to run back around the Welsh defence and score under the posts for his hat-trick. Elder scored a try out of nowhere four minutes later for the Exiles on his Aviva Premiership debut, as he found space on the left wing to touch down in the corner. Wasps instantly replied though as Tagicakibau finished a great run through the centre by reaching for the line. And the game ended on a high for Wasps as Leiua finished the scoring with a darting run through the middle. James Cannon wins a line-out for Wasps ahead of London Welsh's Matt Corker as Wasps recovered their form. Andy Goode adds extras as Wasps renewed their chase for a European Champions Cup place.  .",
    "claim": "Wasps beat London Welsh 40 - 13 at the Kassam Stadium. Tom Varndell scored a hat - trick for Wasps. Ashley Johnson, Sailosi Tagicakibau and Alapati Leiua also crossed. Welsh will finish bottom of the Aviva Premiership.",

The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex.

I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. . The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. . Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.'

Sagna's acrimonious departure from Arsenal when his contract expired at the end of last season left many Gunners fans dismayed at a perceived lack of loyalty from the defender. The France international has played only 16 times for City this season in an underwhelming campaign both for him and the Premier League holders, who are languishing in fourth. Bacary Sagna (right) insists he does not regret leaving Arsenal for Manchester City last summer. Sangna (right) has only made 16 appearances and City are fourth in the Premier League, with Arsenal second. Sagna departed Arsenal on the back of winning the FA Cup but faces a year without a trophy at City. But the 32-year-old Sagna says if he was faced with the decision again, he would make the same choice. 'I see a lot of comments from fans saying I should have stayed at Arsenal but if I had to do it again, if I had to come back and sign for City, I would have done it again,' Sagna told the Manchester Evening News. 'I'm happy because I came to the champions.' Sagna departed the Emirates on the back of an FA Cup triumph but arrived at City with the club having won the Premier League. A year later, Arsenal are gearing up to defend their trophy against Aston Villa in the final at Wembley but City's Premier League title will almost certainly be claimed by Chelsea. Sagna is philosophical about how City and Arsenal's seasons have unravelled. 'When I signed I just wanted to come, give the maximum, and give my best for the club then after, it’s life, no?' Sagna said. Sagna (left) said he would make the same decision again if he was faced with a similar choice . Sagna believes Manuel Pellegrini's City side will soon return to winning ways and end the season well. Sanga also brushed aside fears that City could be usurped from the Champions League qualifying places and believes Manuel Pellegrini's side will swiftly return to winning ways. 'Everyone looks forward in the same direction, we want to be successful as a team and the coach and the staff and everyone is part of the team,' Sagna said. 'We are doing out best to get back to a winning team and to finish the season well.'  .",

    "document": "Former Leeds and England coach Tony Smith admits he was shocked by Kevin Sinfield's decision to switch codes but, on reflection, believes it could be an inspired decision. Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist. . Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season. Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012. Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott. Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. . Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final. Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year. 'I think it's fantastic to make that decision to bow out of Super League probably at the right time,' Smith added. 'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage. 'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right. I'm no expert on when other people should retire but I'm pleased for Kevin and he'll certainly give everything he's got to his new employers. 'That's how he's been in rugby league and I've got no reason to think it'll be any different.' Sinfield has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of Jason Robinson, Andy Farrell and Sam Burgess. 'Ideally I'd like to play fly-half,' Sinfield said. 'It's the position that suits the skill set I have the best. . Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge. 'I understand the challenge that's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over. That's why I think I'm in the best possible place to help with that transition. 'Playing union is something I've always wanted to do. I didn't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities. When this opportunity came up I knew it was the right thing. 'I'm excited by it. I know the potential at the club and it's something I'd like to be a part of. 'I'm very respectful of the game and I like watching it. I think a lot of rugby league people look down on rugby union, and I think a lot of rugby union people look down on rugby league. But I like both games. As a sportsman, to get the opportunity to play another professional sport is something that really appeals to me.'  .",

    "document": "Birmingham is the rat capital of the UK and the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs, according to new research. The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. . Scroll down for video . A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs. Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. . A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_. While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland.  . The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. . 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.' Wasp numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years (left) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country (right) The number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in Scotland in the last five years, data showed, with those in Fife most likely to report a problem.  .",

    "document": "According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, \"(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia.\" The Columbia team concluded that \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, \"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that \"the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent.\" \"Actionable\" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \"true.\" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is \"concerning\" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about \"a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue.\" If I said, \"The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals\" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the \"small group\" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are \"between jobs,\" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.",

Liverpool offered Ibe fresh terms in February after he had a deep impression in a sequence of games, particularly against Everton and Tottenham, that coincided with an improvement in the club’s fortunes. A deal has now been agreed and it is simply a case of the highly-regarded Ibe, who has been absent since damaging knee ligaments against Besiktas on February 26, putting pen to paper. Jordon Ibe in training for Liverpool at Melwood as he prepares to make a return from injury. Ibe is set to sign a new long-term deal at Liverpool after breaking into the first team this season. Rodgers says Ibe, 19, has looked ‘absolutely sensational’ after stepping up his rehabilitation work in the last couple of weeks and he could come straight back into the starting line-up against Newcastle on Monday night. The issue Rodgers must address is whether to stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used at Blackburn in the FA Cup last Wednesday or revert to the 3-4-3 system that had been the catalyst for an improvement in results. . One thing Liverpool’s manager has conceded, though, is that Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season, given all the injuries he has suffered. Ibe, pictured in action against Tottenham, damaged his knee ligaments while playing against Besiktas. Sturridge, who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games, admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year’s sparkle and his manager agrees, following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh, calf and hip issues. ‘It’s a long time out,’ said Rodgers. ‘When you’re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. ‘The key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt, a total run at pre-season and hopefully he’ll be fine for next season. Until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him.’. Brendan Rodgers prepares his Liverpool team for the visit of Newcastle to Anfield on Monday. Daniel Sturridge is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off. Rodgers added: ‘Every player is different. With Daniel there’s been a number of injuries that he’s had and that’s before he came here. He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult. ‘He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that isn’t all down to you — sometimes it’s about luck as well.’.",

    "document": "Andy Murray and his Davis Cup colleagues have got their preferred venue by securing London’s Queen’s Club as the place where they will take on France in their quarter final. The venerable club in Baron’s Court will host Britain’s biggest home tie in three decades from July 17-19, after agreement was reached between its management and the Lawn Tennis Association today. British Captain Leon Smith and his lead player had made it clear that they wanted to take on the strong French team on grass, as it would appear to give them fewer selection options from their rich resources. Andy Murray in action last year at the Queen's Club, which will host the Davis Cup quarter final against France. Murray celebrates winning at Queen's in 2013 - one of three triumphs he has had at the tournament. Tickets go on sale on May 27 and the match is sure to sell out quickly with the likely capacity of the one court used being around 7,000, as it is for the AEGON Championships, which takes place two weeks before Wimbledon. The All England Club’s overworked show courts, plus the redevelopment work being done there, meant that SW19 was never an option only five days after the Championships finish. The fixture means a bumper helping of six weeks’ top level grass court tennis in the UK this summer, a far cry from 20 years ago when some believed the sport’s one organic surface might even disappear. This time there will be three weeks between Roland Garros and Wimbledon, so by the time GB take on France for a place in the World Group semi-finals all the players will be perfectly attuned to the grass. The court at Queen’s is at least the equal of Wimbledon in terms of quality, and the atmosphere will be very different from the usually staid one that accompanies the principle warm-up event for the big fortnight. Thanks to Murray, GB and France look well-matched and it could well depend on who wins the doubles rubber on the Saturday. France has seven players in the world’s singles top 50, although some have been affected by injuries this season. However, they will be encouraged by the recent comeback of Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who is their best grass court exponent and looking in decent form after overcoming arm problems. He has done well at Queen’s before but his record is not as impressive as that of Murray, who has won the pre-Wimbledon title three times. Murray said: 'Queen’s will be a perfect venue for our quarter-final match against France. I’ve been playing at Queen’s for ten years now so I feel very at home there as do the rest of the British team, so it’s a great choice. Fingers crossed it’s a memorable summer for British tennis.' Jo Wilfried Tsonga is back to form after overcoming an arm problem and will be a big threat for the French.  .",

The figure represents $1 million for each of the 51 additional years that John Bieniewicz, 44, could have lived, according to the lawsuit in Wayne County court. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland, the representative of her husband's estate, is suing Bassel Saad, along with another man who controlled the team and the soccer league. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland (pictured left with her late husband) has filed a $51 million lawsuit against Bassel Saad (right) who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer. Bieniewicz died after Saad punched him in the head just moments before Saad would have been ejected from a weekend game in Livonia. Dr. Jamal Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other, and performed CPR which failed to work. . 'We hope this lawsuit sends a message that when you commit uncivilized acts in a civilized world there are consequences, even beyond the criminal realm,' said attorney James Acho, who had known Bieniewicz since childhood. Cyril Hall, Saad's attorney in the criminal case, said Friday that the lawsuit surprises him. 'Bassel Saad is not an individual of wealth. He was a mechanic,' Hall said. Behind bars: Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. The Associated Press left messages seeking comment from a telephone listing for the soccer league. Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. . He expressed remorse in court and said he prays for the Bieniewicz family. The lawsuit also names the Michigan United Soccer League, which is accused of allowing Saad to play despite his reputation as a violent player. Citing his doctor, the lawsuit described Bieniewicz, who had two children, as being in great health with the potential to live to age 95. Bieniewicz is pictured being administered CPR on the turf after being knocked out cold by Saad. 'I speak for his dozens of buddies, many of whom go back to our days at Catholic Central High, and we want justice for his family,' said Acho, who is handling the case with co-counsel Karen Daley. . In 2005, Saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field. Court documents obtained by Detroit Free Press indicate that he repeatedly struck another player in the head. Saad pleaded no contest in that case and was sentenced to five days of community service and 12 months of probation. Mrs Bieniewicz testified at Michigan's Capitol earlier this year in support of proposed legislation that would make it a felony to assault a sports official in the state. Referees ‘are out there on an island with no one to defend them,' she said. 'Something more than a misdemeanor should be in place.' .

But although pleased with the way his side stayed patient to win, Deila felt their cause wasn’t helped by the state of the Paisley surface. And he believes Scottish football will struggle to develop top players if there isn’t a drastic improvement in our pitches. Celtic manager Ronny Deila was impressed with his side's performance against St Mirren on Friday night. ‘It was a tough game, St Mirren were well organised and played very deep,’ he said. ‘They fought really hard and it was difficult to break them down. We had to be patient. The pitch was better than some others we’ve played on. But the pitches in Scotland are terrible. ‘If you want to develop players and get passing football, it’s difficult when the ball is bouncing all the time. It’s much easier for the other teams to just sit behind the ball and try to break down our play. ‘It’s better to play on an artificial surface than this. If they are watering artificial pitches and they are of the best quality, it’s totally different and much closer to European standards. James Forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring Celtic's opening goal against St Mirren. ‘If we are going to develop good young players, you need a good surface to play and train on. If not, you get fighters. If you want skills and technique, play on better surfaces. ‘They are much better in Norway. Sixty per cent are artificial and the grass pitches are better as well because they don’t train there and there aren’t other teams playing on them. And we play in the summer. That’s the biggest thing. The pitch here might not look so bad but try to play on it.’. TV pictures showed Leigh Griffiths eating a chocolate biscuit while sitting on the bench. But Deila, a strong advocate of fitness and conditioning, laughed it off. ‘I think it was a carbo biscuit which is totally different! I’ll have to check his weight tomorrow.’. Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side's 2-0 victory. Goalscorer Johansen believes there’s no stopping Celtic as they close in on a treble. ‘It looks great for us now,’ he said. ‘I don’t think we’re unbeatable but there is a huge confidence in the team. ‘We are starting to look fitter and have much more of the ball because we’re playing with a higher tempo. That’s the way the manager wants us to play. I said in the beginning when people were asking questions I was confident he would be a great and it’s starting to look that way.’. Saints boss Gary Teale felt there were positives in defeat but wasn’t happy about the handball awarded against Viktor Genev for Celtic’s penalty. ‘Was it ball to hand or hand to ball? If they’re going to give penalties for things like that they need to give all of them in every single game.’.

Ipswich: Bialkowski; Chambers, Smith, Berra, Fryers; Chaplow (Bishop 45), Skuse, Tabb (Williams 67); Varney, Murphy, Wood (Sears 45) Goal: Varney 48. Bookings: Smith, Berra . But Ipswich couldn't force an equaliser let alone manage the victory that would have seen them leapfrog Brentford into the top six. 'We were poor – nowhere near as competitive as usual,' said McCarthy. 'I was very angry at half-time and strong words were spoken. . 'I had to walk off at the end to calm down slightly rather than shake all the players' hands. It's been disappointing, let's leave it at that.' Huddersfield, who hadn't won in seven matches, went ahead after 12 minutes. . Wells capitalised on loose play from Zeki Fryers and curled a left-footer into the corner for his 13th goal of the season. Luke Varney (centre left) heads home early in the second half but it wasn't enough for Mick McCarthy's men . After Ipswich's 23-goal top scorer Daryl Murphy had seen an effort cleared off the line, the home side extended their lead after half-an-hour when James Vaughan rose well to head in Jacob Butterfield's cross at the far post. . Luke Varney headed a goal back after 48 minutes but Huddersfield deservedly held out to leave manager Chris Powell declaring: 'We deserved it. . 'Our first-half display was arguably the best we've played since I've been here. . 'Vaughan and Wells took it to them from minute one. Fortunately for Ipswich's promotion hopes, three of their remaining five matches are at Portman Road starting with bottom-of-the-table Blackpool on Saturday. McCarthy added: 'I don't feel happy-slappy at the moment but me and (assistant) Terry Connor will watch this game back at seven o'clock in the morning and we'll start preparing for the next one. . 'I don't have any fears about the response on Saturday.'  . McCarthy (right) looks down as his side failed to keep up with the pace of their promotion rivals. Freddie Sears (centre) and Tommy Smith compete for the ball as Ipswich chased a late equaliser.",
    "claim": "Nahki Wells gave Huddersfield the lead after 12 minutes at the John Smith's Stadium. James Vaughan doubled the home side's lead in the 30th minute. Luke Varney pulled a goal back for the Tractor Boys in the second half. Ipswich have now lost four of their last five away games in all competitions.",

    "document": "While the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq holds the world's gaze, a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention: the deterioration of al Qaeda. In an audio message released Sunday, al Qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders, known as Ustad Ahmad Farooq and Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in CIA drone strikes in January in North Waziristan, near the Afghan-Pakistan border. Farooq's real name was Raja Mohammad Suleman, al Qaeda said. He was a Pakistani who acted as the group's liaison to the Pakistan Taliban and was the deputy commander of al Qaeda's South Asia branch. (Mansur's real name was Qari Ubaidullah, a Pakistani who oversaw suicide missions against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan). Al Qaeda's South Asia branch is relatively new, announced with some fanfare back in September by al Qaeda's top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The creation of the terror group's South Asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from ISIS, which is embroiled in a public dispute with al Qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement. The deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al Qaeda's bench of leaders. On Monday, in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, local al Qaeda commander Nurul Hassan was killed in a raid, said Arif Hanif, district inspector general of police. Florida-raised Adnan Shukrijumah, 39, who was in charge of al Qaeda's operations to attack the West, was killed in December in a Pakistani military operation. Texas-born Mohanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, who also played a planning role for al Qaeda's operations, was arrested in Pakistan last year. The deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of al Qaeda left except al-Zawahiri. Both Ubaidullah and Suleman were Pakistani. This is an indicator of how al Qaeda has become a largely Pakistan-focused group, increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of Pakistan or Afghanistan. Indeed, al Qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the West. The last successful al Qaeda attack in the West was the London transportation system bombings a decade ago. Al Qaeda is now reduced only to holding American hostages such as 73-year-old aid worker Warren Weinstein, who was kidnapped from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore on August 13, 2011. To be sure, al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, continues to pose a threat to American aviation. The group has built hard-to-detect bombs, which it has placed on U.S.-bound flights. Luckily, those bombs were faulty or were detected. The group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January, killing 12, but it's not clear if AQAP had any direct role in planning this attack. Meanwhile, ISIS continues to attract Western recruits and also inspire \"homegrown\" terrorists in the West, but the core al Qaeda organization that killed almost 3,000 men, women and children on 9/11 is on life support. Al Qaeda's confirmation of the deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment.",

    "document": "Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for \"lost\" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the \"holiday\" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the \"mistake\" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut. Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the \"war on women\" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious \"war on women\" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap. But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The \"war on women\" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the \"war on women\" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative \"solution\" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.",

    "document": "A top television producer is suing his ex-wife for more than £300,000, claiming that she lied to him about being the father of her son. Chris Lewis, 68, has brought the unusual court case against 48-year-old former wife Nicola over the child he helped raise as his own for 17 years. In court documents he claims Mrs Lewis had sex with another man only a few months into their marriage, but did not tell him. She had a child – Charlie, now 19 – as a result but led him to believe the boy was his, he argues. Suing ex-wife: Chris Lewis, 68 (left) has accused his former partner Nicola, 48 (right) of duping him about the paternity of her son Charlie. DNA tests now prove that Charlie is not his biological son, he says, and as a result of the deception he suffered loss and damages – and wants compensation totalling £322,400. The claim, made in documents before the High Court in London, says that the pair married in October 1994 and that Mrs Lewis gave birth to Charlie in March 1996. The couple separated in May 1999. Although Charlie subsequently lived with his mother, Mr Lewis says he ‘would see him regularly and make financial contributions towards his maintenance and advancement’. He claims that his ex-wife continued to lead him to believe that he was the boy’s biological father and he was recorded as such on the birth certificate. He was discussed as being the father in the course of the couple’s divorce, with Mrs Lewis signing ‘statements of truth maintaining that was the case’. Everything changed in April 2013, however, shortly after Charlie’s 17th birthday, when both he and Mr Lewis had DNA tests. They are said to have proven beyond doubt that Mr Lewis was not the boy’s father. The court documents claim that Mrs Lewis’s repeated assertions that her ex-husband was the father of her child ‘were made fraudulently’ with her ‘knowing them to be false or not caring whether they were true or false’. Mr Lewis’s lawyers say that Mrs Lewis ‘had sexual intercourse with David Alderson or an unknown person which resulted in the conception of Charlie in or around May or June 1995’. High-profile contract: Mr Lewis's company, Chris Lewis Media, provided coverage of the Equestrian events at the London Olympics and the TV producer brought Charlie to the venue during the games. They add: ‘On no occasion during the parties’ marriage did Mrs Lewis inform Mr Lewis that she had had sexual intercourse with another person/persons. ‘She knew that Mr Lewis was not the biological father of Charlie, or was reckless as to whether he was the biological father, or did not believe he was the biological father. ‘By reason of her deceit and misrepresentations, Mr Lewis has suffered loss and damage, and claims damages plus interest.’. Mr Lewis was for decades one of the BBC’s leading sports producers, masterminding footage of every Olympic Games since 1972 as well as working on coverage of ten football World Cups. Since leaving the BBC in 2006, he has specialised in equestrian sports. He is understood to have taken Charlie to equestrian events at the London 2012 Olympics, which his TV company Chris Lewis Media was filming, a few months before he discovered he was not the boy’s father. Speaking about the court case, Mr Lewis, of Twickenham, South West London, said: ‘It’s been a very hurtful time for all parties.’. Mrs Lewis lives in a £1.2million house in Shepperton, Surrey, and is a company director of a fireplace shop. She told the Daily Mail last night: ‘I haven’t even looked at the document from court, and I can’t say anything because it’s in the hands of my solicitors.’. David Alderson, 59, of Cobham, Surrey, who is alleged to be a former lover of Mrs Lewis and the possible father of her child, was unavailable for comment last night. .",

    "document": "David Cameron has a 'secret plan' to cut taxes for millionaires after the General Election, Ed Balls claimed today as Labour ramped up its attack on the eighth day of campaigning. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less'. But the Prime Minister hailed today as 'money-back Monday' - with a raft of tax changes coming into force putting more cash in voters' wallets. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls, speaking in Leeds this morning, ramped up his attack on the Tories today - claiming that David Cameron was planning a VAT increase and cuts to the top rate of tax. Mr Cameron has claimed that Labour are planning to increase taxes by £3,028 on 'every working family'. . But, speaking in Leeds this morning, Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000 from 45p to 40p. Tory Treasury minister David Gauke hit back with an accusation that Labour has a secret plan to boost revenues by dragging more workers into the 40p higher rate of income tax and increasing national insurance contributions. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone. Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, who cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p in his 2012 Budget, each refused to rule out a further cut to 40p in comments on Sunday. . They are expected to come under further pressure on the issue during campaigning in the South West. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less'  Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000 from 45p to 40p. Mr Balls said: 'We know that is their secret plan - another big tax cut for millionaires. 'How can it be fair when families here in Leeds and across the country are struggling and £1,100 a year worse-off? 'How can it be fair to have a tax cut for the very richest when our NHS is in crisis and going backwards? 'How can this be fair when we need to get the deficit down and the Tories are now planning deeper cuts in the next three years than the last five?' Mr Balls said a cut in the top rate to 40p would save someone earning £1 million a year £340,000 over the course of the next Parliament, while someone with income of £5 million would get a total tax cut of £1.94 million over the five-year period. Meanwhile, he said that unfunded Conservative plans to cut £10 million from income tax by raising thresholds for the 20p and 40p rates would require the equivalent of a two-point rise in VAT, costing an average couple with children £1,440 over four years. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg meets supporters at the Grove Pub while out campaigning in Surbiton, London. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' Voters would not believe Mr Cameron's denial that he intends to increase the consumption tax, because Conservatives had 'a track record of breaking their promises on VAT', he said. However, Conservatives claimed secret Labour plans for tax rises would cost each working family more than £3,000 over the course of the next five years - an estimate which was dismissed as unfounded by independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies a week ago. Mr Gauke said: 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband must set out the details of their secret plan for GBP3,028 of tax rises on every working family - the British people have a right to know what these tax hikes are. The choice at this election is clear. Lower taxes under David Cameron. Or higher taxes under Ed Miliband and the SNP.' Mr Balls insisted that Labour will not raise VAT, national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax if it wins the general election. But he confirmed that the party would restore the 50p top rate for earnings over £150,000, as well as imposing a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes. Mr Clegg hit out at both sides and warned only his party can ensure a balanced plan to clear the deficit. He said millions of people would get a tax cut worth almost £400 from a Liberal Democrat pledge to push the income tax personal allowance to £12,500. . By contrast, Labour's plan to reintroduce the 10p starter rate of income tax would be worth just £37 to taxpayers. 'Labour's short-term economic plan will lead to mounting borrowing and leave taxpayers short by hundreds of pounds, which is unfair and reckless,' said Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in Kingston-upon-Thames and the South West. 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's tax plans are economically illiterate. Labour has already failed to commit the £8 billion needed for the NHS, and are now failing to give taxpayers the tax cut they deserve.' Mr Clegg met Elise Popperwell - aged just seven months - and her mother Melissa Popperwell while out campaigning in Surbiton. Mr Balls said: 'All of our plans are fully costed and paid for. None of our manifesto commitments will require a single pound of extra borrowing ... 'So this is the choice at the election, a choice between a Conservative Party which has a track record of breaking their promises on VAT and will raise it again after the election or a Labour Party which has never raised VAT and will not raise VAT in the next Parliament. 'A Tory way which means millions pay more while millionaires pay less, or Labour's plan to back millions of working people, save our NHS and balance the books in a fair way.' Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was concentrating on his own constituency of South Thanet, where a weekend poll suggested he was trailing in second place in the close three-way marginal. On a campaign visit to Surbiton, south-west London, Mr Clegg said that Liberal Democrats had blocked Tory plans to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p during the coalition. Conservative ministers were 'always more interested in tax cuts for people at the top rather than tax cuts for people at the bottom or the middle', Mr Clegg told Sky News. 'I was very amused yesterday to hear George Osborne and David Cameron saying with earnest sincerity that they had no plan of giving further tax cuts to people at the top because, I tell you, they had exactly that plan in government and it was something that we said we would not go along with.' Mr Clegg's comments came after Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told The Independent that during coalition negotiations over tax cuts, a Conservative minister told him: 'You take care of the workers and we'll take care of the bosses.'",

The dog caused a severe fire after managing to switch on the cooker while trying to reach his dog treats. The heat from one of the hob's rings set fire to a child's seat that had been left resting on the electric appliance. Fire starter: Hungry Leo almost burned down his owner's home  as he hunted for his dog treats. The blaze was started after the Staffordshire-Boxer cross was believed to have knocked one of the cooker knobs, switching on the hob. Smoke began to fill the three storey home in Peckham, south-east London, as owner Allen Mosey's son, 21, and his daughter's boyfriend relaxed in upstairs rooms. The pair   managed to flee unharmed with Leo after noticing thick black smoke billowing up the stairs. More than 10 firefighters were needed to extinguish the flames. . A search of the house later revealed that the source of fire was the cooker. Firefighters believe that when Leo was hunting for food he knocked one of the cooker's knobs, turning the rings on. The blaze damaged one third of the ground floor of the property and Leo's family have been left surviving on sandwiches. .

    "document": "It's T20 season on the sub-continent and the world's best players are about the pad up for the latest edition of the Indian Premier League, cricket's most exciting and richest domestic tournament. Eight teams will play a total of 60 games over almost seven weeks across 12 venues all round India in a battle to be crowned champions of the tournament's eighth edition, with the final taking place at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on May 24. Can Kolkata Knight Riders retain their title? Will Virat Kohli lead the Royal Challengers Bangalore to their first title? Can MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings win their third crown? And who are the players to watch out for? Sportsmail tells you all you need to know in our guide to the 2015 Indian Premier League as India prepares for the spectacular cricket roadshow. MS Dhoni, pictured in the 2011 Champions League, is looking to guide Chennai Super Kings to a third title. CHENNAI SUPER KINGS. The bright yellow jerseys of the Super Kings are one of the iconic sights of the Indian Premier League. Led by the superstar Indian duo of MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina, Chennai are the most successful team in IPL history. As well as their back-to-back victories in 2010 and 2011, CSK have been losing finalists three times and never failed to reach the last four. In international players Dhoni, Raina, Ravi Ashwin, Ravi Jadeja and Mohit Sharma, the Super Kings have probably the best pool of Indian talent in the tournament, which is key given that seven of the starting XI have to be domestic players. The foreign talent is also strong, though, and includes New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, South African Faf du Plessis and West Indian all-rounder Dwyane Bravo. ONE TO WATCH: There are so many. Dhoni needs no introduction, Raina is the top scorer in IPL history, but MCCULLUM is one of the most exciting players in world cricket at the moment. He hit the first ever IPL century in 2008 and will be looking to build on a brilliant World Cup campaign. Brendon McCullum's aggressive brand of cricket led New Zealand to the World Cup final. £1,740,000 - Yuvraj Singh's salary, the highest in the 2015 tournament after he was picked up by Delhi Daredevils in the auction. . 3325 - runs Suresh Raina has scored, the most in tournament history. 2008 - Year the IPL was first played. 119 - wickets taken by Lasith Malinga, the most in the history of the tournament. 60 - matches in the 2015 tournament. 46 - days the tournament lasts, beginning on April 8 and ending on May 24. 12 - venues to be used in 2015. 8 - teams in 2015 edition of the IPL. 3 -  English players in the tournament - Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara and Kevin Pietersen. DELHI DAREDEVILS. The side from the capital are out to prove a point having never won the tournament and never even reached the final. The Daredevils have missed out on the semi-finals the last two seasons and will be looking to get back on track this year. . They are led by South African JP Duminy and a lot of their overseas talent also comes from the same country in the form of Quinton de Kock, Imran Tahir and Albie Morkel, although Sri Lankan all-rounder Angelo Mathews is a handy player as well. World Cup outcasts Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra, all of whom featured in India's successful 2011 team, will relish a return to the big stage and try and force themselves back into international reckoning. ONE TO WATCH: In 22-year-old DE KOCK, Delhi have the most exciting young wicketkeeper batsman in the world. De Kock has already scored six one-day international tons but his highest score in the World Cup was an unbeaten 78. 2011 World Cup winner Yuvraj Singh will be out to prove a point after being left out of this year's India team. KINGS XI PUNJAB. After years of just making up the numbers, the Kings XI Punjab lit up the 2014 tournament on their way to topping the table in the round-robin stage before losing in the final. Punjab's success in 2014 came largely thanks to their strong Australian contingent, and this year they will be just as reliant on the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, George Bailey and Shaun Marsh. But the Kings XI also have South African powerhouse David Miller in their ranks along with Sri Lankan Thisara Perera. Their Indian talent isn't the strongest in the tournament but Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay have both performed on the big stage for their country, and 21-year-old Axar Patel is one of the best young talents in India. ONE TO WATCH: The destructive MAXWELL. One banner in the stands in Chandigarh last year read 'Glenndeep Singh Maxwell - the King of Punjab'. It was Maxwell's power-hitting that almost led his team to the 2014 title and he showed again at the World Cup just how dangerous he can be. Glenn Maxwell was one of the top run-scorers in the IPL last year and almost guided the Kings XI to the title. KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS. The reigning champions Knight Riders have one of the most balanced teams in the tournament and will be looking to win their third IPL title in four years. Gautam Gambhir's international career may have stalled, but he is still one of the most talented Indian batsmen out there. Along with Gambhir, Yusuf Pathan was also part of India's 2011 World Cup winning team while Robin Uthappa was the leading run-scorer last year with 660. In terms of overseas talent, Kolkata boast Sunil Narine, Morne Morkel, Johan Botha, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib-al-Hasan and Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate. ONE TO WATCH: It's rare for India to produce fast bowlers with genuine pace, but they have one in UMESH YADAV. Kolkata will be looking for Yadav to combine with Morkel and Narine as part of a fearsome bowling attack. Sunil Narine, pictured in action for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 Indian Premier League. MUMBAI INDIANS. The team that once featured the great Sachin Tendulkar finally won the IPL in 2013, and they have an excellent chance to lift their second title this year. In Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha and Parthiv Patel, Mumbai have a strong core of Indian talent, but it is their overseas game-winners that makes them dangerous. Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga is the highest wicket-taker in tournament history with 119, and he is joined by Kieron Pollard, Aaron Finch, Corey Anderson and Josh Hazlewood. After losing in the eliminator against Chennai last year, the Mumbai Indians will once again expect to reach the play-offs and mount a serious challenge for the title. ONE TO WATCH: The demon bowler that is MALINGA has made a habit of cleaning up batsmen in the IPL and was key in their success in 2013. He will once again lead this bowling attack. .

RAJASTHAN ROYALS. Since Shane Warne's side won the inaugural IPL in 2008, the Rajasthan Royals have only made the play-offs on one occasion since. Rajasthan's short history has been eventful to say the lease. They were expelled by the BCCI and then reinstated in 2010 and were also rocked by the spot-fixing scandal that saw former Test match bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth banned for life. This year's Royals team features a strong Australian presence in captain Shane Watson, Steve Smith and James Faulkner as well as New Zealand seamer Tim Southee. Their Indian talent lacks star quality, though, with Ajinkya Rahane, Stuart Binny and Dhawal Kulkarni the only men who have forced their way into the national side. ONE TO WATCH: Australian SMITH has enjoyed a summer of dominating India and was instrumental in his country winning the World Cup. Smith is a dangerous player with the bat, can hold up his end with the ball and is also one of the best fielders in the tournament. Steve Smith will look to continue his excellent form into the Indian Premier League with Rajasthan. Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, pictured in 2009, is a part owner of the Rajasthan Royals. ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE. Any batting order that contains Chris Gayle, AB de Villers and Kohli has half a chance, but it has been Bangalore's bowling that has held them back in recent years. Bangalore have never won the IPL and have missed out on the play-offs altogether in the last three years. The Royal Challengers paid big money in the auction to pick up Dinesh Karthik (£1.17million) in an attempt to shake off their underachievers tag. But news that World Cup player of the tournament Mitchell Starc will miss the start of the IPL will hurt their bowling attack. ONE TO WATCH: Any of their big three batsmen really, but DE VILLIERS is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket for his stunning range of shots.  .

SUNRISERS HYDERABAD. The newest team in the Indian Premier League, the Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to embark on their third campaign having been founded in 2013 and replaced the Deccan Chargers. The Sunrisers will be led up front by the explosive opening duo of David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan and their middle order will feature New Zealander Kane Williamson and English duo Ravi Bopara and Eoin Morgan. Hyderabad also landed Kevin Pietersen in the auction for what looked like a bargain of £205,000 after he was released by the Delhi Daredevils, but the 34-year-old will not feature in the orange shirt unless they make the play-offs. Pietersen reached the agreement with the Sunrisers in order to return to Surrey in an attempt to resurrect his England career, but the play-offs take place during the same week as England's first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. The Sunrisers also boast a a strong bowling line-up with foreign stars Dale Steyn and Trent Boult supported by Indian internationals Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. ONE TO WATCH: Hyderabad's strength is up top with captain Warner and DHAWAN. The Indian batsman scored two centuries at the recent World Cup and, like Warner, has the power to take the game away from the opposition if he's there for a while. Eoin Morgan will look to move on quickly from England's miserable World Cup when he plays in the IPL. Kevin Pietersen, here playing for Delhi in 2012, will join Hyderabad if they make the play-offs.  .",

Pictured: Migrants are transferred to holding centers after disembarking from in Augusta's port, near Siracusa, Sicily. Italian police say they were informed of the alleged attacks by a group of Nigerian and Ghanaian survivors upon their arrival in Palermo, Sicily yesterday. The survivors said they had boarded a rubber boat on the Libyan coast on April 14, which had 105 passengers aboard. During the crossing, a fight broke out over religion, with the group of Muslim passengers threatening the Nigerians and Ghanaians after the latter declared themselves to be Christians.

But they were left disappointed after pumping the liquid to the surface, only to discover it was so polluted that they could set it on fire. Residents of Ansai, in Shaanxi Province, central China, said they could smell gas and petrol coming from the well, and blame a leak from a local petrol station, The People's Daily Online reports. Villagers in Ansai, Shaanxi Province, in central China, dug a 46m well in order to get fresh drinking water, but when the pumped it to the surface the found it was so polluted it could be set on fire. Local officials say they have now launched an investigation into how the water from the well, which cost £1,000 to build, became so polluted. Locals said they could smell  petrol when the water surfaced, and blame the pollution on a leak from a local gas petrol station, a claim which the owner denies. However, when Chinese officials investigated, they said they could find no trace of a spillage, leading some people to theorise that the villagers could have struck oil. However this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits only occur between 750 and 4,500m underground, and the well is only 46m deep. Tuo Zhijun, a villager in Ansai, said: 'Who knew when we turned on the pump, once the water was seeping through, everyone could smell gas and see oil slick.' Some locals have suggested that the lucky villager may have struck oil, but this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits typically occur between 750 and 4,5000m underground, and the well is only 46m deep. After drawing the first fresh water out of their new well, the villagers discovered they were able to set it on fire because it was so polluted. Local officials do not yet know exactly what substance is in the water, though they say they are conducting a specific investigation to discover the cause. ‘We suspect that there was an oil leak from a petrol station not far from here.’ .

    "document": "Sunshine smile: Judy Murray waves to the crowds. Her youngest son has only just tied the knot with his long-term partner Kim Sears. But Judy Murray has already wasted no time in revealing she simply ‘can’t wait to be a granny’. However, the tennis coach, who helped propel Andy, 27, and his brother, Jamie, 29, to sporting success, has a couple of caveats – he has to get the French Open and Wimbledon out of the way first. Mrs Murray, 55, who has carved out her own star status after appearing on Strictly Come Dancing last year, also said she would be a ‘very active granny’ and in the same way she coached her sons, she already has plans to introduce her grandchildren to tennis. She told Closer magazine: ‘I’m really looking forward to being a granny. I’ve always wanted to have grandchildren but I had to be patient and let them get married first. ‘I’m not sure when they will have kids as Andy has the French Open followed by Wimbledon, but I know he wants them. I will be a very active granny, that’s for sure – and I can’t wait to introduce them to tennis.’. Her words come only a few days after her son and his bride wed at Dunblane Cathedral on Saturday, drawing more than 3,000 well-wishers to the streets of his home town.

And the women had a chance to confront the woman, named Kayla, on an episode of Dr Phil that aired on Friday. Scroll down for videos . Seven women who were all believed to be in an online relationship with the same man found out that they had been catfished by a 24-year-old woman in Texas named Kayla. Kayla apologized to the women, saying she was trying to figure out who she was because it's 'difficult' to be both gay and Mormon. 'Can I ask what triggered this in the first place and why you've done it for so long?' one of the women asked. Kayla responded by saying she tried to figure out her life in the 'wrong way'. . 'It's for the simple fact that being gay and being Mormon is hard,' Kayla said. 'Your church tells you, \"We love you, but we don't love who you are\".' In the episode she apologizes to the women, most of whom forgive her and say they would have been her friend in other circumstances. 'I'm sorry that I dragged you guys into my mess. Whether you believe me or not, that's up to you,' she said to the women. The women has spoken to the women for various amounts of time, ranging from a month to more than a year. . Kayla had taken the identity of a man named Keagan, who goes to school in Montana. He apologized to the women who all had been talking to a Kayla, who used Keagan's pictures online. The women's faces all looked disappointed and shocked when Kayla first walked through the door, revealing herself as the person they had all been talking to. The women mostly wanted to know why Kayla decided to pretend to be a man and why she had spoken to some of the women for longer than others. Kayla had stolen the identity of a Montana student named Keagan, who the women had a chance to meet on the Dr Phil segment. . He had no idea his identity had been stolen and apologized to the women for what had happened to them.  . One victim said that the man she thought she was talking to told her he loved her, while another said he became 'her perfect guy' and that it 'almost seemed too good to be true'. . It emerged that Kayla was a catfish - someone who tricks others online by setting up fake profiles with fake pictures and names- after one of the women became suspicious and looked into the man she had been talking to. Kayla told Dr Phil that she 'didn't have any evil intentions' and that she was just trying to figure herself out. 'I created an online persona so I could figure out who I was, and figure out if I was gay or not and figure out if I wanted to be part of the religion or not.' Kayla, who now says she is gay, said. She added: 'Do I want to be part of the church, or do I want to be gay? And unfortunately, I saw myself in a position where I couldn't have both... You don't understand how difficult that is.' Victim Hilary Hayes said she had been texted out of the blue by someone calling himself 'Hunter Anderson' who claimed to have seen her at a party and that he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The women appeared uncomfortable at times during the interview and some even rolled their eyes at what Kayla was saying. Most of the women, however, agreed to forgive Kayla for what she did. She told Fox13 that they would regularly text and talk and he even sent her flowers on Valentine's Day - but that Anderson would never agree to meet up. At the same time, another victim, Sara Vanwagenen, believed she was in a relationship with a man called 'Hyrum Young'. She too reported that the person they were in contact with would never agree to meet up. The pair eventually realised the texts they were receiving were from the same number and it turned out they had both been duped by a woman called Kayla, from Texas. . Vanwagenen is reported as saying: 'I let this person into my life in a really big way. I was really angry and really hurt.' Hayes added: 'She just knew everything about me it was just really hurtful to find out that you literally didn't know anything about this person, not even something so foundational as their name.' .

Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February. Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state – let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. . 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah – especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. . The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later. Alshammari's attorney Ron Yengich declined to comment on Tuesday, saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest. . When asked about Alshammari's connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege.

    "document": "A Lithuanian gangster accused of two murders in his home country has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds in a deportation farce after claiming he was too depressed to leave Britain. Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his ‘manifestly ill-founded’ case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. . This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the £40,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: ‘This is a shocking example of Labour’s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.’. Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. . He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius’s claim that extradition breached his human rights was ‘inadmissible’. They added: ‘The court considers this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected.’ .",
    "claim": "Kestutis Martuzevicius, 52, is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania. He spun out legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill. In Lithuania he is accused of two murders, robbery and extortion. European Court of Human Rights criticised his' manifestly ill - founded' case.",

    "document": "Universal's \"Furious 7\" is about to make history.\"Furious 7\" — the final film from the late Paul Walker — is expected to gross $115 million or more when opening at the North American box office this weekend, the top showing ever for an April title, not accounting for inflation.Domestically, it is getting the widest release in Universal's history with a theater count of roughly 4,003 (including Imax locations), eclipsing \"Despicable Me 2\" (3,956). Anything north of 4,000 is usually reserved for summer tentpoles and year-end titles. Overseas, the movie is also poised to do massive business, putting its global debut north of $250 million. \"Furious 7\" is opening day-and-date around the world on 10,500 screens in 63 territories, save for a few major markets including China, Russia and Japan. THR: 'Furious 7' scores Thailand release despite Tony Jaa contract dispute. The current record-holder for top April opening domestically is \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" which debuted to $95 million from 3,928 theaters last year. \"Furious 7\" is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date. And if it beats the $121.9 million launch of \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1\" in November 2014, it will mark the largest three-day opening since \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" ($158 million) in November 2013. The movie enjoys massive awareness and interest, due to both the popularity of the street-racing series and Walker's death. The last film,\" Fast & Furious 6,\" debuted to a franchise-best $117 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2012, including $97.4 million for the three days, on its way to grossing $788.7 million worldwide. Universal intended to open \"Furious 7\" on July 11, 2014, but production was halted in November 2013 when Walker died in a car crash during the Thanksgiving hiatus. After director James Wan, writer Chris Morgan and Universal pored over existing footage and tweaked the script, production resumed in April 2014. THR: Studio profitability report - Who's up and who's down. CGI and voice effects were used in some scenes featuring Walker's detective character, Brian O'Conner, with Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody, used as stand-ins. \"Furious 7\" pits Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto and crew (which includes Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson, among others, as well as Walker) against Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw, out for revenge after the death of his brother. \"Furious 7\" is expected to usher in a string of mega-openings at the box office this year. Disney and Marvel's \"The Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" set to open May 1, hasn't come on tracking yet, but some forecasters are already suggesting it could score the top opening of all time domestically, eclipsing the record-breaking start of \"The Avengers\" ($207 million) in 2012.

    "document": "Hector Bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans, and possibly even by his manager, as Arsenal's premier right back, after impressing in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy. The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates. Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season. 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. . And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations.  . 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. . Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres. Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time. But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again. 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. . But after his brilliant goal at the Emirates stadium last weekend, one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres.  .",

    "document": "Ronald Koeman is looking forward to this weekend's 'special' match against Tottenham, ahead of which the Southampton manager praised the 'great job' predecessor Mauricio Pochettino did at St Mary's. The former Argentina defender ended a 16-month stint on the south coast last summer to sign a five-year deal at White Hart Lane. Pochettino's exit was the catalyst to an unparalleled talent drain from St Mary's, although successor Koeman has not only steered the club to calmer waters but to new heights. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has praised the work of his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino at the club. Pochettino (left) managed Southampton between 2013 and 2014 before leaving for Tottenham Hotspur. Southampton full-back Nathaniel Clyne (left) tussles for possession with Stoke's Steven Nzonzi (right) Stoke forward Jonathan Walters dribbles ahead of Southampton's Maya Yoshida (right) in their last game. Koeman had to cope with several player sales at Southampton, including Luke Shaw to Manchester United . Attacking midfielder Adam Lallana (right) was also sold to Liverpool shortly after Koeman arrived at the club. With five matches remaining, Saints are just a point and a place worse off than Spurs in sixth and can usurp them in the European spots with victory in Saturday's early kick-off. 'Everybody was afraid because we had to make a lot of changes in the team,' Koeman told reporters. 'But I think the quality of the players that we brought in were good, at a good level. I think the rest of the players had really a good aspiration and ambition to do a good season, to play a good season at a good level. 'Now we are fighting for a high position in the table. There's still five games to play and a very nice one this Saturday afternoon. 'It is Tottenham, the difference is only one point and, okay, for the fans maybe it makes it a little bit more special because Mauricio is now the coach and was the coach of Southampton. 'He is the coach of the opponent this Saturday, so that makes it special but the game will be decided between the white lines.' Koeman was speaking at St Mary's after meeting Barclays Spirit of the Game hero Tina Croucher, who was being rewarded for her community work at the club. The Southampton manager and midfielder Victor Wanyama answered questions from a handful of supporters as part of the event, where talk of Pochettino was rarely far away. Koeman says his return along with the potential implications of the result makes Saturday's match the biggest at St Mary's since he took the reins. A positive result would see Saints break their record Premier League points haul set last year by Pochettino, although he is unlikely to get a particularly warm reception. The former Argentina defender's departure left a sour taste with many Southampton fans, whose travelling support gave him a taster of what to expect at White Hart Lane earlier in the season. 'Sometimes if you go as a Barcelona player to Madrid the reception is difficult, and sometimes in Holland,' Koeman said, when asked if he has such a bad reception. 'But, okay, I think the reception for Mauricio normally has to be good because he did a great job for Southampton. 'I like him as a person and as a coach and we have a good contact.' Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama (centre) shields the ball from Swansea players back in September. There certainly does not appear any bad blood between Koeman and Pochettino, despite the latter suggesting earlier in the year that he handed the Dutchman an easy job at Southampton. Koeman took those comments in his stride, joking at the time that he only came to Southampton 'to have a nice little holiday'. Now, just days before the game, the Saints boss gave a more serious answer, praising his Spurs counterpart for the legacy he left at St Mary's. 'I think they make the beginning (of this) and developed the quality of the players, the young players,' Koeman said. 'I think the structure and organisation in the team, the spirit of the players starts under Mauricio. 'I took that over and maybe we were different in some details. From what I heard, maybe I try to do more training sessions with the ball and maybe he was a little bit more physical. 'I think the start, for the development of the team, was under Mauricio and he did a great job last season. 'We continue (that) and so far we made it a little bit better than it was, but that is all about the experience and quality of the players.' .

    "document": "Former QPR manager Harry Redknapp feels he still has plenty to offer football but only at the right club, having turned down a 'mind-blowing' offer to coach abroad. The 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'. Redknapp will return to the dugout on Sunday, May 31 when he leads a star-studded Men United XI against Leyton Orient Legends, as O's youth coach and Prostate Cancer UK ambassador Errol McKellar hosts a charity football match at The Matchroom Stadium. Harry Redknapp (right) says he would consider a return to management as long as it's at the right club. Redknapp was speaking at the announcement of a Men United XI vs Leyton Orient Legends charity match. The well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances. 'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me. 'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do. Redknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February. Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago. The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time. 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches. He said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level. . Redknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club. The Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining. 'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.' Redknapp lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer and is backing the Men United campaign to help raise awareness of the disease, which is the most common cancer in men with more than 10,000 deaths each year. He said: 'Prostate Cancer is something which can affect any family at any time so it is important that people come out to support this cause. 'We are all scared that if the doctor tells you that you have something wrong, but if you get there early enough it can be cured - you can't let it just go.'

    "document": "Tuesday, April 14, is Equal Pay Day. Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make:. \"Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn.  And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.  And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too.\" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty.  And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. \"Everyday Americans need a champion,\" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, \"and I want to be that champion.\" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day. With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy.  And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap. Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work?  Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.  They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates. Policy (I hope) still matters, but we're as likely to debate a candidate's \"image\" as her or his \"substance.\" The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics, as they are in our culture in general.

Christian Benteke's hat-trick earned a draw for Villa, with his last goal coming just seven minutes before full-time, and within five minutes of what had looked like a winner from Charlie Austin. Matt Phillips had earlier given QPR the lead in the first half but taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point at Villa Park. Tony Fernandes spoke of his despair after his Queens Park Rangers team twice threw away a lead. Fernandes, Rangers chairman, was watching the 3-3 draw at Villa Park from his iPhone away from the game. Taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point. And Fernandes, currently in Malaysia, spoke of his experience of a variety of emotions while watching the game from the other side of the world. 'It's a strange thing thus QPR love,' he tweeted. 'I went to bed at 1 in the morning. I got up exactly at 2.45 am. No alarm. My heart knew it's QPR time. . 'I watched the game on my iPhone all kinds of emotions. Despair, disappointment, joy, but most important pride. 4 points from two away games.' Fernandes revealed that Richard Dunne and Leroy Fer could return for Sunday's visit of Chelsea and that Yun Suk-young would also return after that game. The character of QPR's Clint Hill and Chris Ramsey were praised by their club's chairman on Twitter. Charlie Austin looked like he might have scored a late winner for QPR but Christian Benteke equalised. Clint Hill scored his first Barclays Premier League goal for Rangers' second, and Fernandes was delighted with the display of the veteran centre back, even if he did fail to get to grips with the prolific Benteke. He also reserved praise for manager Chris Ramsey. 'Clint hill typified our fighting spirit,' he posted. 'As I've always said players playing for the badge and Chris Ramsey what a pro.' Finally, Fernandes posted some cryptic tweets as to his own future at the club, perhaps hinting that he would be leaving. Hill had equalised in the second half after hosts Villa led 2-1 at the break courtesy of Benteke's two goals. Matt Phillips opened the scoring for Rangers but they found themselves pegged back by brilliant Benteke. Fernandes is also Global CEO of AirAsia, the airline that saw flight QZ8501 go missing late last year. 'It's been a tough three months since December 28th. Abuse, tragedy, close friends gone but I never stopped believing in all that we do,' Fernandes said. 'The decision on my future has been made. 6 games 18 points. Never stop believing rangers fans. Les also a hero. Never stop believing.' . QPR stay inside the relegation zone but moved up to 18th place with the draw. They face Chelsea at Loftus Road on Sunday in what is sure to be another occasion to play on supporters', and the owners', emotions. .",

Gerrard will leave Anfield at the end of the season to join Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy and the skipper is hoping to bow out in style by leading Brendan Rodgers' side to the final at Wembley. But ahead of Wednesday night's quarter-final replay with Blackburn, Fowler has warned Gerrard's team-mates not to concentrate on providing the 34-year-old with a fairytale ending to his Liverpool career. . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (right) trains alongside Rickie Lambert at Melwood on Monday. Gerrard will miss Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final replay with Blackburn because of suspension. Reds legend Robbie Fowler, pictured with Kenny Dalglish, says Liverpool's players must not focus on Gerrard. Fowler told goal.com: 'Everyone would absolutely love Steven to win it, what with this being his last season and possibly last game, and hopefully that will be the case. 'But Liverpool have got to get themselves into the position where they can't do this just for Steven Gerrard. They've got to do it for every individual involved with the club. That's the way it should be.' Gerrard will miss the trip to Ewood Park as he serves the second match of a three-game suspension and Fowler hopes that Jordan Henderson and Co put their missing captain to the back of their minds. 'If you put too much effort in for one man, maybe you can get a little bit too excited or overboard,' added Fowler. 'As much as it would be Steven's last game, they've got to get past that and just do it for themselves. 'In an ideal world, they'll do it, and no-one would love it more than me. Steven deserves to go out on a high but they've got to do it for themselves. It's not all about Steven.' Fowler has also urged Raheem Sterling to end his contract wrangle and commit his future to the club after he rejected a new deal worth £100,000-a-week. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling has rejected a new £100,000-a-week deal to stay at Anfield. Fowler believes Sterling, pictured training on Monday, should stay at Liverpool to develop his game. Writing in his column for the Daily Mirror, Fowler said: 'I think it’s nonsense to suggest Sterling will have to go elsewhere to win trophies and fulfil all these dreams he’s apparently got. 'In the space of two seasons, with a very, very young team that will only get better, they should have won the league, should have beaten Chelsea in a semi to get to Wembley... and should play in an FA Cup Final there in May. 'I was brought up at Anfield and still work there, so what else am I going to think?, but he’d be crazy to go at this stage in his development, especially because he’s being guided by a special manager who has already turned Luis Suarez into one of the best players in the world... and earned Luis the money to go with that status.'  .",

    "document": "Tim Sherwood's jacket did not survive beyond the first 10 minutes and after this astonishing contest it remains to be seen if either of these sides fare much better. When Aston Villa's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of Christian Benteke's first half equaliser, he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the Barclays Premier League after all. Indeed when he then saw Benteke convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes, he may have felt his damning critique on Monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for. But the grit, desire and determination his forwards had demonstrated was lacking at the opposite end of the field and a QPR side every bit as desperate to maintain their top flight status did a fine job of exposing exactly the weaknesses Sherwood had highlighted. Matt Phillips (left) headed Queens Park Rangers into a seventh-minute lead, getting on the end of Bobby Zamora's cross. Winger Phillips garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond Brad Guzan in the Aston Villa goal . Joey Barton wheels away after watching Phillips nod in at the back post, as Ciaran Clark (left) and Carlos Sanchez appeal for offside . But QPR were only ahead for three minutes after Christian Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh Premier League goal of the season. If it made for a hugely entertaining encounter, it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be. Sherwood walked off the pitch at half-time with his hands planted casually in his pockets, comforted by the fact that his side were sitting five points clear of relegation danger. But when Charlie Austin followed Chint Hill's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors, Villa had replaced Chris Ramsey's spirited side in the bottom three. Only 12 minutes remained, and even if Benteke required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free-kick the overriding feeling in the Villa ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief. Benteke did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat-trick at the sound of the final whistle. On the contrary, he looked devastated. Both sides have some difficult games ahead but when Tottenham and Manchester City come next for Villa, there is plenty to concern Sherwood. A replay of QPR's goals will not make pleasant viewing. The failure to close down Bobby Zamora before he delivered the cross that enabled Matt Phillips to strike after only seven minutes. The failure to challenge Hill and so stop him scoring his first Premier League goal. The failure too to respond to the threat being posed by Austin, who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from Phillips before driving the ball past Brad Guzan. Such frailties could yet drag Villa down this season, and Sherwood knows it. 'We are not equipped unfortunately to go anywhere and dig out a result,' he complained afterwards, and on this evidence he would appear to be right. .  . Aston Villa (4-4-2): Guzan 6; Bacuna 6, Vlaar 5.5, Clark 6, Richardson 6; Cleverley 6.5, Sanchez 6.5, Delph 7, Grealish 6.5; Agbonlahor 7.5, Benteke 8. Manager: Tim Sherwood 7.

CLICK HERE to view our brilliant Match Zone - including Christian Benteke's second goal. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood threw down his gilet in celebration after Benteke scored the early equaliser. Benteke was at the double in the opening 45, sweeping beyond Green to put Villa ahead just after the half hour. Defender Clint Hill was the unexpected scorer of QPR's equaliser just after half-time to make it 2-2. Hill grabs the Queens Park Rangers badge in celebration after scoring his first ever Premier League goal. Charlie Austin got ahead of Ron Vlaar and had looked as if he'd won the game for QPR. At times his side were excellent here, thrilling their supporters with a tremendous first half display. Phillips might have landed the first blow for QPR but the players he was probably referring to as 'the icing on the cake' were giving him plenty of cause for celebration. They were attacking with great flair and finesse, with the pace of individuals like Gabriel Agbonlahor and Leandro Bacuna and the sheer power of Benteke. The call for more men made Sherwood's selection of 19-year-old Jack Grealish somewhat curious. But the teenager too was performing well. More than man enough for the occasion. As a game it was something of an emotional rollercoaster, even if the warmth of the embrace between Sherwood and Ramsey before kick-off was soon replaced by the cold reality of a dire situation for both teams. Never one to hide his feelings, Sherwood responded to QPR's opening seventh minute goal by unzipping the aforementioned gilet in disgust. It was understandable really, given how meekly his defenders tried to stop Zamora from delivering the cross Phillips then headed home from close range. Only three minutes later and the same gilet was off altogether, Sherwood throwing it to the ground after seeing Benteke's shot take a nasty deflection off Mauricio Isla's trailing foot and loop over Rob Green. . The drama in the technical area added to the sense of excitement around Villa Park. The atmosphere was electric, the place almost erupting again when Grealish so nearly marked his first Premier League start with a goal. Benteke delivered a perfect ball into the path of the teenage winger only for Green to make the save at his feet. Sherwood's decision to play a midfield diamond and exploit the pace of his attackers was working well for Villa. Not everyone seemed to agree, and at one stage Sherwood seemed to be placating a fan who didn't seem quite so impressed. But his team were playing with real verve, with Benteke scoring a second after 33 minutes with a goal that owed as much to the speed, vision and courage of Agbonlahor as the precision of the finish. Agbonlahor was just quick enough to send Benteke clear before being hacked down by Sandro, and remained curled up in a ball while his colleague raced towards goal. Benteke finished cleverly, shaping to shoot beyond Hill before dragging his effort back inside the QPR defender and beyond the reach of a wrong-footed Green. . Austin salutes the travelling Rangers supporters inside Villa Park but they weren't able to cling on to the points . But Benteke's wonder free-kick, much like Jason Puncheon's on Monday night, meant Villa came away with a point. Benteke can't conceal his delight at completing his hat-trick and rescuing a point in the 83rd minute. Good friends Chris Ramsey (left) and Sherwood know each other well and were going head-to-head in the dugout for the first time. Former Villa striker Stan Collymore couldn't hit his elation in the press box after Benteke knocked in his second of the goal. Sherwood urges the supporters packed inside Villa Park to up the ante as they looked to move clear of trouble . Charlie Austin vies for possession with Kieran Richardson during an intense and entertaining first half. Niko Kranjcar attempts to get QPR back in the game but couldn't steer his effort beyond the American Guzan. Villa Park looked a picture on Tuesday night as the two relegation battlers went head-to-head in Birmingham . Sherwood said Ramsey was one of the finest coaches he had worked with and he certainly impressed here. He had seen how his forwards had been starved of service in the first half and responded after six minutes of the second by making two substitutions. It had the desired effect, Hill equalising four minutes later; punishment for what appeared to be Bacuna's failure to stay with his man. Austin's goal – his 17th in the Premier League this season - would be a further source of concern, even if Benteke did then level for a second time with a wonderful free-kick that beat Green via the inside of a post. Are they man enough? Only time will tell.",

    "document": "It's all Pep Guardiola's fault; him and the good folk of Scotland or, at least, St Andrews. It is a simplification, of course, but perhaps a useful way of understanding why, as we survey the Champions League quarter finals, there are no Premier League clubs troubling the scorers. Bayern Munich take on Porto on Wednesday night and even though they are contending with an injury crisis which leaves them without Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben among others you might anticipate a sixth Champions League semi-final for Guardiola in his six years of management. Of course Guardiola isn't alone responsible for the decline of the Premier League in Europe; nor is it really down to St Andrews, though the iconic town with its genteel ambience played its part in continental Europe overhauling the English clubs. Pep Guardiola prepares his side for their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Porto. The Bayern boss gives instructions to his goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at a training session on Tuesday. Something happened back in 2008 when Guardiola took over at Barcelona and it wasn't that the Barcelona team changed. Frank Rijkaard had virtually the same players but Guardiola managed to find an extra 25 per cent of performance in them. What happened was a tactical change which had at its roots in St Andrews, where the Barcelona team spent their first pre season under Guardiola. There Messi was a distracted individual, sometimes sneering at Guardiola's insistence on organisation and pressing, according to Guillem Balague's account in his biographies of Messi and Guardiola. But a breakthrough came when Guardiola stuck up for Messi in his battle with the club to play for Argentina in the Beijing Olympics. The new manager took the young Argentinian under his wing, sidling up to him after training, putting his arm round him to assure him of his support. Guardiola is bidding to reach his sixth Champions League semi-final in his six years as a manager. Guardiola got Messi on side in 2008 after standing up for him in battle to represent Argentina at the Beijing Olympics. Messi, the precocious star, suddenly felt he had an ally in Guardiola. And, as a result, he began to buy into Guardiola's idea of relentless pressing to supplement the tiki taka football, which was already a template at Barcelona. For tiki taka is not what made Guardiola’s team great. 'I loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka. It's rubbish and has no purpose.' It sounds like Sam Allardyce, but those are the words of the great high priest of possession football as reported by Marti Perarnau in his book Pep Confidential. What Guardiola added to Barcelona’s game was the intensity, drive and sheer energy which had wilted under Rijkaard and then moulded it with overwhelming possession. Sometimes, when assessing the English problem in Europe, it helps to reverse the question. So, rather than ask 'Why are we so bad now?' it useful to identify why were we so good between 2005-2009?' Guardiola led Barcelona to Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011 (pictured) The former Barcelona manager is thrown into the air by his players as they celebrate the 2011 success. For Chelsea fans pointing to the 2012 triumph, that it was indeed a victory of rare courage amidst adversity but the decline of English clubs had already begun and that win is effectively an outlier, bucking the established trend. Between 2005-2009 the Premier League provided 12 out of the potential 20 semi finalists for the Champions League; between 2010 to 2015 it has provided three out of 24. Even asking that question is revealing as what English clubs were really good at during that period was making the semi finals and the final rather than winning the trophy. Only Liverpool and Manchester United actually achieved that in the five-year period of English ascendancy, though, of course, Chelsea did so improbably in 2012. What was different about English clubs in that period was the injection of some of the finest tactical minds in the game to the Premier League. Jose Mourinho may never have won the trophy with Chelsea but he transformed their approach and arguably provided the foundations for the 2008 final and the remarkable 2012 win. Rafael Benitez was an extraordinary force, the Diego Simeone of that era, regularly out-witting Mourinho and taking a relatively normal Liverpool team to two finals. Guus Hiddink engineered a fine run to the semi finals building on the work of Mourinho. Manchester United won the Champions League in 2008 when English clubs were dominating the latter stages. Chelsea were an exception to the rule in 2012 when they won the tournament against all the odds. Rising to the challenge of Mourinho and Benitez, Sir Alex Ferguson was tactically at his peak in that period, playing without a recognised centre foward at times in 2008 before Guardiola and others made it fashionable. English teams had always had an intensity with which continental teams had sometimes struggled to cope. What they had lacked often was organisation and tactical nous. Benitez, Mourinho, Hiddink provided that and Ferguson responded. Put all that together and you have a cultural melting pot which, allied to the commercial success of the Premier League, was pushing players and teams to new heights. The Premier League’s TV money of course brought in good, technical foreign players which helped but that does not seem to be the key reason for its success. The money is bigger now and those players still come but it hasn't helped Manchester City. At the zenith of the Premier League's dominance, the 2008 Moscow final, ten English players started the game. Manchester City were eliminated in the last 16 this season at the hands of Barcelona. Chelsea exited at the same stage as England have no representatives in the quarter-finals. When Jurgen Klinsmann spoke about the tactical revolution he was attempting to forge in Germany in 2006 - a style of play which has since evolved at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich - he explicitly referenced the Premier League and its pace. He recognised that continental Europe had fallen behind. It was new tactical ideas meeting the traditional attributes of the English game which helped the Premier League dominate Europe. Conversely, it was Guardiola - and others, such as Jurgen Klopp, Louis van Gaal, Jupp Heynckes - surpassing that intensity which in turn overhauled the Premier League. Clubs such as Barca, Bayern, Dortmund have retained their technical superiority over English clubs but they are now likely to out-run them and out-press them. In reality there is no one man responsible for that change. And, Guardiola's obsession with pressing is rooted in an admiration for South American football and especially Marcelo Bielsa, rather than the Premier League. But when that change took place, the Premier League lost its competitive edge. And when Guardiola put his arm around Messi at St Andrews back in the summer of 2008 and convinced his young protege to buy into that pressing game, European football changed forever.",

    "document": "Joe Hart bemoaned one of his 'worst days in a Manchester City shirt' following Sunday's derby thumping by Manchester United. The England number one appeared devastated after the final whistle at Old Trafford and acknowledged that City's bid to retain their Premier League title was over. 'That's one of my worst in a Man City shirt, definitely,' Hart said after a morale-sapping 4-2 defeat saw under-fire Manuel Pellegrini's men go four points adrift of neighbours United and 12 behind runaway leaders Chelsea. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart, pictured with Frank Lampard, was disappointed with his side's display. Hart was unable to keep out goals by United's Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling. Manchester City are four points behind rivals United . The 27-year-old has even given up on knocking Arsenal out of second place. 'It's essential to try and finish third,' he added. 'We've got to get our heads down and win these massive games.' City had looked dominant in the early stages, racing into a 1-0 lead that they could have extended before Ashley Young's equaliser triggered a derby demolition. 'Not many teams have put us to the sword like that,' Hart said. 'United know what they are doing, they took their chances. Hart, pictured saluting the travelling City fans, does not understand why his side are struggling for form. 'It's hard to take. We've won enough of them to know how to lose properly though and we weren't good enough after the first 15 minutes.' Hart added that City had let their fans down and revealed he was at a loss to explain a dramatic loss in form since the turn of the year that has seen them take 18 points from a possible 39. 'It would be easier to win games if I knew what was wrong with us but we've played well and been unfortunate in some games,' he said. 'I'm hurting from this defeat. There's a lot of emotion running through me. Let's see how it feels on Monday, we'll think about it and we'll go again.'  .",

    "document": "Ashley Young is desperate to avoid being part of the first United team to lose five successive Manchester derbies. United have more silverware in their trophy cabinet, but City have had the better of their local rivals during the last couple of years. Last November's 1-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium was the fourth successive derby win for City. The last time they achieved that feat was 60 years ago. Ashley Young (right) wants to avoid a fifth successive derby defeat by neighbours Manchester City. Ander Herrera celebrates scoring as United move above City for the first time this season. United have lost the last four derbies to City:. 8 April 2013         United 1-2 City. 22 Sept 2013       City 4-1 United. 25 March 2014    United 0-3 City. 2 Nov 2014          City 1-0 United. United have never lost five straight matches to their local rivals and Young wants to end City's dominance this weekend when the Blues come to Old Trafford. 'That's something you want to put right,' the United winger said when asked about City's recent dominance in this fixture. 'It will be another massive game.' Despite City's recent success in derbies, United go into the match as favourites after registering five straight league wins. That run has helped United move into third, one point ahead of City, who slipped to their third defeat in five games at Crystal Palace on Monday. The champions defeat by Crystal Palace was Manchester City's third loss in five games. Young thinks United have a good chance of defeating the Barclays Premier League champions if they maintain their current form. He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play.' Finishing above City would represent a major coup for manager Louis van Gaal, especially after the way his team started the season. But, wary of the fact that seven matches remain, Young is not letting himself get too carried away despite United's recent upturn in form. Sergio Aguero (right) celebrates after scoring the winner in the last Manchester derby in November 2014. 'It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes,' the 29-year-old said. 'It is obviously going to be another tough one against City next week but we will prepare as well as we can do as we always do.' Young's form has been key to United's recovery. The former Aston Villa midfielder has been so good recently that he has kept record signing Angel di Maria out of the United team. That has not been enough to get him back into the England squad though. Many tipped Young to earn an England recall after 19 months in the wilderness, but manager Roy Hodgson left him out of his squad to face Lithuania and Italy. Young is hoping his revival at Old Trafford can force him back into England reckoning. Young revealed Hodgson did not call him to explain his absence from the 24-man party when it was announced. 'There was no conversation (with Hodgson),' said Young, whose last England cap came against Ukraine in September 2013. 'Obviously I will always want to represent my country. I was a little bit disappointed not to be in the squad, but I have just got to make sure I am playing well here at United and hopefully I will get the call at some time soon.'  .",

    "document": "Tony Pulis returned to Selhurst Park for the first time since he left Crystal Palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his West Bromwich Albion side to the edge of safety. Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palace’s fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving. A few boos broke the surface, but they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season, during his 10-month tenure, when he won the Premier League LMA Manager of the Year award. West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side with a fine long ranged effort . Before two minutes on the clock, James Morrison (right) headed West Brom ahead following a corner from team-mate Chris Brunt. The West Brom players race to congratulate Morrison (top left), who headed the away side in front against Crystal Palace on Saturday.  .

It has got unbelievable potential and I mean that. The supporters are wonderful and they have a good manager. They can push on – if Alan is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward this club could be a good club.’ Yannick Bolasie even made the effort to go over and shake Pulis’ hand as he strolled down the touchline. Yet the south London locals would not have been expecting what came within two minutes of kick off when West Brom took the lead. Chris Bunt swung in a corner from the left and James Morrison managed to lose Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon and nod in, completely free, from five yards out. Some of Puncheon’s team-mates looked around in disbelief that the West Brom man was afforded so much space in the box. ‘That was a weakness in our set up that Tony exploited,’ Pardew admitted. ‘It was well worked. Their guy took Puncheon to the edge of the box where he is not comfortable marking. ‘We knew Tony would know the players well, know the strengths and weaknesses, I tried to throw a few ideas in on the pitch. They didn’t come off. . Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie greets former Eagles boss Tony Pulis (right) before kick-off at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon.

People know Tony does an honest job, he plays the game his way and we respect that.’ Despite that early set back, however, Crystal Palace started to play the eye-catching football that has made Pardew so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge. And it was all coming through their main man, Bolasie, on the left. In the 24th minute he weaved into the box, played a one-two then poked an effort towards the near post which West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill did well to save with his feet. Three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that Myhill clawed out. Then, just after the half-hour, a ball came in from the opposite flank from Joel Ward, was headed on by Glenn Murray and Bolasie executed a sublime bicycle kick, only to be denied by Myhill once again. . If Pulis, dressed in his usual full tracksuit, trainers and cap on the touchline, provided this Crystal Palace team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight, Pardew, resplendent in suit and tie, has given them the suave and flair to delight. In this instance, Pulis’ resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes. The ball came out from a West Brom corner and Gardner took a touch before, 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, he buried a right-foot strike over Julian Speroni into the left of goal. It is almost mission accomplished for Pulis at West Brom as they moved to 36 points and put a healthy gap between themselves and the bottom three. .

    "document": "On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled \"Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,\" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \"what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,\" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans \"targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction.\" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book \"Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,\" notes, \"the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems.\" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? \"Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!\" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. \"This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it.\" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.",

    "document": "Bearing in mind he’s a dog, Don the border collie did a pretty good job yesterday of piloting a tractor across a motorway. To be fair, however, this probably wasn’t the first thought to strike rush-hour drivers as they watched him crash through a fence and come hurtling towards them. Like a scene from Wallace and Gromit, the intrepid sheepdog was at the controls when he sent the farm utility vehicle down a steep bank, on to the busy carriageway and into the central reservation barrier. Don's owner Tom Hamilton (pictured) was tending to a lamb when the sheepdog took control by nudging the controls. The tractor smashed through a fence before ending up on the road. Don was unhurt in the ordeal but the incident caused major tailbacks. Despite considerable damage, Don escaped unhurt – but left scores of motorists wondering if they were imagining things. . Traffic Scotland tweeted a bizarre warning that there may be hold-ups ‘due to a dog taking control of tractor’, adding: ‘Nope, not joking.’ . Appropriately, they couldn’t resist the hashtag: ‘#maycausetailbacks’. Observers and Twitter commentators joined the pun fun by speculating: ‘Police investigating – so far no leads’; or the inevitable: ‘This is barking.’ . The incident happened at junction 13 of the M74, near Abington in South Lanarkshire. Sheep farmer Tom Hamilton was travelling across a field in the John Deere Gator farm vehicle with his companion in the passenger seat during their morning rounds. Behind the wheel: Don leaned on the controls of the tractor before driving it on to the M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire during rush hour. The vehicle shot out of the field and crashed down a bank by the side of the road before colliding with the central reservation of the M74 near junction 13 northbound as shown by the red arrow. Moments after he got out of the vehicle, it took off with Don at the wheel. . Safely back at nearby Kirkton Farm yesterday with Don at his side, Mr Hamilton explained: ‘I was sorting out one of the lambs and hadn’t put the brake on. ‘When I turned around I saw it racing towards the motorway. I ran after it but I couldn’t catch up.’ . Traffic Scotland tweeted the news that a dog had 'taken control of a tractor' before adding, 'nope, not joking' Officers cleared the motorway within half an hour and Don was reunited with his relieved owner at nearby Kirkton Farm. Remarkably, drivers managed to avoid the runaway vehicle before it came to crashing halt, and none was hurt. . Nor did the black and white border collie (a breed noted for its intelligence and obedience) panic or flee in terror. . ‘He didn’t even bark,’ Mr Hamilton said. . Police said Don had set the vehicle in motion by inadvertently leaning on the controls. ‘So far people seem to find it amusing,’ Mr Hamilton said. . ‘But I think Don’s driving days are over.’ . Monty, a giant schnauzer cross, was pictured driving a mini down a race track in New Zealand in 2012.",

    "document": "Friends and neighbours. For the next 48 hours, however, the pint will have to stay behind the bar as Chris Ramsey and Tim Sherwood go toe to toe in the scrap for survival. As far as QPR manager Ramsey is concerned, Sherwood’s Aston Villa are in no danger of tumbling out of the Barclays Premier League, despite their lowly position. . The verdict is delivered on the evidence that Ramsey has gathered in four years of working alongside Sherwood at Tottenham. Chris Ramsey believes his friend and neighbour Tim Sherwood will keep Aston Villa in the Premier League. But the QPR boss will be pulling no punches when he clashes with his former Tottenham colleague on Tuesday. QPR scored four goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since March 1994 v Norwich (4-3). . ‘Without a shadow of a doubt I think he will keep them up,’ said Ramsey. ‘He has a good squad, players who have the wow factor and he knows how to manipulate those particular players. . 'If I was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do, I would be putting a bet on him keeping them up.’. Ramsey will be doing his utmost to extend Villa’s top-flight uncertainty on Tuesday night and has reason for optimism given Rangers’ stunning victory at West Bromwich Albion. . Ramsey says if he 'was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do,' he would bet on Villa staying up. QPR celebrate the second of their four goals against West Brom from Charle Austin (right) A second win in the Birmingham area in four days would send QPR above Villa on goal difference. Sherwood and Ramsey, a duo operating as boss and assistant last season at Spurs, will share words in advance. ‘Me, him and Les (Ferdinand) live probably 10 minutes from each other so sometimes there is a pint to be had. I’m sure we’ll speak before the game,’ added Ramsey. ‘We worked together at Tottenham for four years in various jobs,’ said Ramsey. ‘It’s great you can have two coaches who’ve gone through the system and are coaching in the Premier League. The game has to look at it from an English point of view. ‘If things hadn’t gone our way against West Brom then the mountain looks a little bit bigger. The game will be very important for both teams.’. Ramsey and Sherwood were in the trenches together at Spurs and live within 10 minutes of each other. The perspective for Ramsey’s team is more positive after putting four past a West Brom side who for the first half looked to have beach on the brain already. . Joey Barton scored in added time at the Hawthorns to underline the emphatic victory, having six minutes earlier received a forearm in the face from Youssouf Mulumbu that saw the Albion midfielder sent off. That ended any chance of a comeback for the hosts, who trailed 3-0 at the break but pulled one back through Victor Anichebe. First half goals from Eduardo Vargas, Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora, who scored a wonderful lob with the outside of his left boot, did the damage. Eduardo Vargas celebrates the opener for QPR in the remarkable 4-1 win over West Brom on Saturday. Bobby Zamora (left) scored QPR's third goal with an astounding lob to give his side a 3-0 half-time lead. Austin’s strike was his 16th in the Premier League this season and Barton suggested he would have an England cap by now were he in a more fashionable side. ‘It helps if you play for certain clubs to play for England,’ said the QPR midfielder. ‘Certain people who haven’t done as well as Charlie, who has scored so many goals in a struggling side, seem to be shoo-ins in the England side.’. QPR captain Joey Barton celebrates his goal, his team's fourth, late in the game at The Hawthorns.  .",

    "document": "Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. . 1. Dick Advocaat might consider bringing in referee Anthony Taylor to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play. The official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from Yannick Bolasie when he completed his hat-trick for Crystal Palace in the 4-1 demolition of Sunderland. Top marks for him – but none at all for Lee Cattermole who was goal side of Bolasie before the breakaway began, yet way behind the official when the goal went in. Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when James McArthur’s clearance began the move, but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net. Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole before scoring his hat-trick goal against Sunderland . Cattermole was goal side of Bolasie before the Crystal Palace winger went on to score his third goal. Referee Anthony Taylor sprinted past Sunderland midfielder Cattermole during Bolasie's impessive run. Bolasie starred in Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . 2. Gary Cahill has responded to the challenge of fighting Kurt Zouma for his place in Chelsea’s defence and looks to be winning the battle. When it got tough for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road it was Cahill who responded best to ensure Cesc Fabregas’ late striker was a winner. Cahill made 15 clearances – as many as the rest of Chelsea’s back four put together – and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball. Gary Cahill has managed to win back his starting spot alongside John Terry after his brief absence . Chelsea starlet Kurt Zouma had deputised for Cahill during the England international's stint on the sidelines . 3. Arsene Wenger’s decision to axe goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after fining him for smoking in the showers at Southampton has proved a pivotal point of Arsenal’s season. The 1-0 victory at Burnley was the sixth clean sheet the Gunners had kept in 12 Premier League games since David Ospina took over – one more than they’d achieved in the previous 20. More important, Arsenal have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing Wojciech Szczesny . 4. Vincent Kompany’s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost Manchester City needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign. City were in the middle of a 14-game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals Arsenal at the end of January – a game they lost 2-0. The 4-2 collapse at Old Trafford made it 14 matches since then, of which City have lost eight. Belgian star Kompany has missed only one of them – a 2-0 win over Leicester which saw one of only three clean sheets. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has struggled for form during the past few weeks . 5. West Brom’s 'Jeff Astle day' provided a nostalgic trip back in time, with Albion’s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 (goalkeeper Boaz Myhill wore no number, like John Osborne back then). But there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football’s black and white days – every one of Albion’s players wore coloured boots. Four red pairs, two orange, two white, one blue, one yellow – and captain Darren Fletcher’s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher wore multicoloured boots on 'Jeff Astle day' at The Hawthorns. 6. When Paul Lambert was sacked in early February, Aston Villa had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. It’s taken Tim Sherwood just 10 games to overtake that total – Christian Benteke’s winner at White Hart Lane was the 16th scored since his appointment. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has returned to form since Tim Sherwood's arrival at Villa Park. 7. James Ward-Prowse backed up manager Ronald Koeman’s faith by tucking away the penalty against Hull that put Southampton on the path to a 2-0 win. Koeman had to shout orders from the bench to let the England youngster take the kick as Senegalese striker Sadio Mane picked up the ball to head for the spot first. You couldn’t blame Mane for wanting to jump the queue – Ward-Prowse had never scored a Premier League goal in 68 previous appearances for the Saints, and none of his four England Under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman ensured James Ward-Prowse took penalty ahead of Sadio Mane . 8. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation. The London-born product of the Royals’ youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0-0 draw with Blackburn in his first start for 16 months – just in time to be available for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. He has a good chance of playing at Wembley after helping make the defence more solid. It was the first time Steve Clarke’s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine Championship games. Reading's Jem Karacan made his first start for 16 months against Blackburn on Saturday afternoon. 9. Taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in League One – it’s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years (Gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010) This season looks like being different, though, after Crewe’s draw with Leyton Orient left both clubs plus Crawley on 47 points with four games still to play. That means sleepless nights for Crawley boss Dean Saunders who’ll have bad memories of going down from the Championship with Wolves despite finishing on 51 points. Crawley Town are in danger of dropping down to League Two despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games . 10. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has the curious middle name of Armani – and he’s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set-pieces. The 22-year-old is on his third loan of the season from Bristol City because Pilgrims boss John Sheridan admires his pinpoint accuracy with a dead ball. He showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free-kick in a 2-1 win over Mansfield that put Plymouth back into the League Two play-off places.

    "document": "Adam Federici lay inert on the turf for a moment. He realised the magnitude of what happened. He understood the horror of it instantly. He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time. It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe. The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game. Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp. Reading had fought valiantly but were unable to score another equaliser to take the tie to penalties. Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. The Reading goalkeeper, who had been magnificent until then, left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him. Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved. Reading: Federici, Gunter, Hector, Pearce, Obita, McCleary, Williams, Chalobah (Cox, 106), Robson-Kanu (Karacan, 90), Mackie, Pogrebnyak (Yakubu, 111). . Subs not used: Stephen Kelly, Norwood, Yakubu, Andersen, Cooper. Booked: Chalobah. Goal: McCleary, 54 . Arsenal: Szczesny, Debuchy, Mertesacker (Gabriel, 63), Koscielny, Gibbs, Coquelin (Walcott, 101), Cazorla, Ramsey, Ozil, Sanchez, Welbeck (Giroud, 72). . Subs not used: Wilshere, Ospina,  Monreal, Flamini. Goals: Sanchez 39, 106. When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season’s Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. ‘I am happy we are through,’ said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. ‘But I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him — I have been there, done that.’. Clarke did his best to ease Federici’s pain, too. ‘This is the life of a goalkeeper,’ said the Reading boss. ‘And Adam is a top goalkeeper. There’s every chance he’ll be Reading’s player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. ‘We stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. He’ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham I’m sure he’ll be as good as he always is.’. Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wenger’s team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenal’s fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled. . Sanchez leaps skywards to celebrate his second goal of the game for Arsenal against Reading. Sanchez (left) rifles Arsenal into the lead against Reading in the FA Cup semi-final against Reading.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (centre) gives instructions out to his team before the beginning of extra time. Federici’s mistake gave them an escape route that they followed eagerly. They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate. . Gabriel (right), a replacement for Per Mertesacker, powers a header at goal shortly after Reading had scored. But Reading goalkeeper Federici made a splendid one-handed save to tip the ball up and against the crossbar. Sanchez (centre) earlier took the ball past goalkeeper  Federici (second left) before losing his footing and falling. Daniel Williams (left) shoots at goal for Reading against Arsenal at Wembley but his attempt went wide of the goal. It seemed then that Arsenal would extend their lead. Reading’s threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbs’ head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands. Redemption was not far away for him. It will take longer to greet Federici. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has an effort blocked by Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici.

    "document": "Barcelona will offer £50million for in-demand Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, and plan to let him stay in Italy for a year on loan. Spanish press reports indicate Chelsea are their only rivals for the Frenchman's signature. Pogba is one of Europe's most in demand young talents but Spanish paper SPORT say that the leaders in La Liga and the Barclays Premier League are the only two viable destinations for the 22-year-old Frenchman. With Barcelona currently under the restrictions of a FIFA-imposed transfer ban until the January window, Pogba would have to be loaned back to Juve until the 2016-17 season as part of any prospective deal. . SPORT say Barcelona will make a £50m offer for Paul Pogba while Marca look at the race for La Liga. Pogba is said to be the subject of a £50m bid from Barca with Chelsea their only realistic transfer rivals. Lionel Messi returned to training for Barcelona after a foot problem ahead of facing Celta Vigo. SPORT claim that Pogba has listened to Barca's offer but is yet to decide on his future with four years remaining on his contract with the Italian champions. The Catalan daily also say that Lionel Messi has recovered from a problem with swelling on his foot to start for Barca in their return to La Liga against Celta Vigo on Sunday after making it through a training session unscathed. Also in Spain, Marca look at Real Madrid's quest to overhaul their perennial rivals at the top of La Liga. They say that if Real win their final 10 games to take a total points haul of 94, they can count on winning the title. That might be easier said than done, however. No team has won their last 10 games in La Liga in the last decade, no matter how sure Real are that Barca will falter. L'Equipe look ahead to a big weekend in the French title race, A Bola pin Benfica's hopes on Nicolas Gaitan. David Luiz and PSG have made their way to the top of Ligue 1 but that position will be challenge this weekend. Marseille and their star striker Andre-Pierre Gignac will want to knock PSG off the top of the table. It's a huge weekend in France with Le Classique top of the bill, Lyon getting the opportunity to top the table and Monaco taking on St Etienne. With that in mind, L'Equipe go with the headline: 'The hunt is on'. Champions PSG are still in with a shout of an unprecedented treble, sitting top of Ligue 1 with eight games to go, in the semi-finals of the French Cup and having reached the last eight of the Champions League. But their abilities are certain to be tested on Sunday night in a first vs third clash against Marseille at a packed 67,394-capacity Stade Velodrome. A difficult April schedule makes it important that PSG stay top of the table in Marseille, having struggled to maintain a title challenge for much of the season. Gaitan is viewed as the key man for Benfica as they look to open up a gap on Porto in Portugal. Manager Jorge Jesus said Gaitan is a star of different characteristics to his other players, with no equal. With nearest rivals Porto faltering, A Bola in France focus on Nicolas Gaitan's position as Benfica's leader as they look to wrap up the Primeira Liga title in the coming weeks. Benfica boss Jorge Jesus said of Gaitan: 'Nico is a player of different characteristics, we have no equal to him. 'He's a player with a lot of influence and he can be with us for many years. He is a leader on the pitch and it's good to know that he will be with us.' Benfica face Nacional on Saturday hoping to keep up their excellent home form which has seen them concede just two goals at the Estadio da Luz all season. The Italian papers have gone big on the race for a place in next season's Champions League. Carlos Tevez (left) could add PSG to his list of clubs if reports in the Italian press are to be believed. Finally, the Italian papers are going big on the race with the Champions League. Both Corriere dello Sport and Tuttosport look to Saturday's Roma-Napoli showdown as the first of a few clashes to decide the placings at the top of the table come the end of the season. . Corriere also note that PSG could be a possible destination for Pogba, and that they are looking for a double swoop on Juventus with Carlos Tevez also a target. . There is also a small mention for how Carlo Ancelotti could return to manage AC Milan from Real Madrid if the Spanish club call time on their Italian manager. .  .",

    "document": "When Jack Wilshere was first showing signs of his enormous potential at Luton Town’s academy, the big boys down the road soon came calling. Everyone was into little Wilshere, with West Ham (the team his dad Andy supports), Tottenham and Arsenal all offering to give Luton’s academy kid a shot at the highest level. Wilshere was a Hitchin boy, spotted early by Luton’s scouts before Arsenal took him to their Hale End academy at nine. At 16, he made his first-team debut for Arsene Wenger’s side. Charlie Patino, 11, and his family must weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Arsenal star Jack Wilshere he is a talented midfelder who has been spotted at Luton Town. Soon it will be decision time for another Luton discovery as 11-year-old Charlie Patino and his parents Julio and Katy weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Jack, he is a midfielder. The Patinos are a level-headed family, absorbing the enormity of the offers on the table from three of the biggest clubs in the Premier League before they come to a decision at the end of the season. ‘We just want what’s best for Charlie, to give him the best chance of being a professional footballer if that is what he wants to do,’ said dad Julio on Wednesday. ‘He is a dedicated boy, he works hard at school, gets good grades and is committed to playing football. He just loves it.’. Charlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. ‘Other parents have commented on it in the past,’ admitted Julio. The big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA’s compensation guidelines. The transfer fee involved is £10,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton. There are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision. Charlie, pictured with his sister Lily and dog Truffles, would cost £10,000 and is a season ticket holder at Luton. 11-year-old analyses Spanish football and his style of play has been influenced by favourite team Barcelona. Julio’s parents are both Spanish. They moved to England in the Sixties before their son was born in England. Charlie watches live La Liga games on Sky Sports. Julio, who is a supporter of La Liga strugglers Deportivo La Coruna, added: ‘Charlie doesn’t watch the Spanish football, he analyses it. His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.’. Charlie’s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents’ home in London Colney, Hertfordshire. Soon enough he was invited to play for Luton, often playing in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability with the ball. He has a superior touch and a great feel for the ball, making the game appear effortless. He trains six times a week, spending more than 10 hours a week playing in various age groups at Luton’s highly respected academy before playing a game on a Sunday for the club. Julio, who works in the telecommunications industry, and mum Katy, who works for Marks & Spencer, insist their son has been unaffected by the interest from London’s three biggest clubs, who made their initial moves a few months ago. Charlie has often played in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability on the ball. He trains six hours a week, spending more than 10 hours a week at Luton (pictured Kenilworth Road) The Patino family have already visited the training grounds of Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea with their son, listening to the sales pitches and making it clear that they will take their time. ‘Charlie is only 11 but he gets it and he knows what is happening to him,’ added his dad. ‘He knows that this is a big opportunity to train with a top club, even though there are no guarantees at the end of it.’. The Patinos have been guided through the process by Luton, with the club’s chief executive Gary Sweet making sure that they have been kept fully informed. Julio intends to continue to take his son to Kenilworth Road next season even though Charlie will be settling into his new club. ‘Everybody at Luton has been fantastic and it is a very impressive set-up,’ he added. ‘They have really looked after Charlie over the years.’. The Patino family live near London Colney and have visited Arsenal, Spurs and Chelsea's training grounds.  .",

    "document": "REJECTION PROOF. by Jia Jiang. (Random House, £13.99) Who likes rejection? Whether you are being rejected by a lover, an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you, it’s galling. And in every case there’s nothing we can do about it. Nothing that doesn’t carry a long prison sentence, anyway. It would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis, and Jia Jiang is both of those. Born into a family of teachers, Jia Jiang was so determined to become an entrepreneur that, as a child in China, he dug a hole in the garden, intending to reach America by the shortest route. He eventually made the journey by conventional means, and found a good life there. Wife, children, several degrees, job in middle management. But he wasn’t happy. He wanted to take risks, start his own company. It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there’s nothing we can do about it (picture posed by model) . The problem was he inevitably encountered rejection, mainly from potential backers for his project (another iPhone app no one could possibly need or want). And each time, rejection felt like the end of the world. A successful entrepreneur needed to be more robust than this. So, having possibly read one self-help book too many, Jia Jiang decided to embark on his own rejection-proofing quest. Instead of avoiding rejection, he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected, film them and put them up on his blog. All of which seemed to me, at first glance, rather artificial. There have been any number of ‘quest’ books, in which humorous writers have gone round Ireland with a fridge, for example, less for the sake of doing it than to write a book about it. But Jia Jiang isn’t a humorous writer. He may adopt a light-hearted tone, but his quest was deadly serious. On day one, he went up to a security guard and asked if he could borrow $100. The security guard said no, and Jia almost broke into a run to get away. Watching the video later, he said he looked like the man in Munch’s The Scream. On day two, he went into a burger joint and, noticing a sign on the soft drinks machine saying ‘Free refill’, asked the cashier for a burger refill. The cashier said no. But as he continued his quest, Jia realised there were ways and ways of asking. Show confidence, inject a little bit of humour, be willing to negotiate and you might not get exactly what you want, but you might get something. So he walked into Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and asked for a set of five iced doughnuts, interlocking in the manner of the Olympic symbol. The woman behind the counter looked thoughtful. ‘When are you looking for these?’ she asked. ‘In the next . . . 15 minutes?’. ‘Let me see what I can do,’ she said. And did it. You can see what happened next on YouTube. And so develops a surprisingly entertaining study of rejection in all its many manifestations. People confuse it with failure, but rejection is personal, and we take it personally. The crucial point is that rejection is unavoidable and it’s how we respond to it that matters. Jia Jiang’s extreme positivity can grate at times but his message is sound: rejection is only someone else’s opinion, and it may not be the right one.  .",

    "document": "Joko Widodo's chief political rival reportedly promised to publicly support the Indonesian president if he granted clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved, The West Australian reported. It's understood Mr Prabowo penned a letter to Mr Joko at the weekend in which he said that if the president were to 'postpone the executions indefinitely', he would come out in support of the decision. Scroll down for video . Indonesian President Joko Widodo (left) ignored reassurances from his chief political rival Prabowo Subianto (right) that he would support a decision to grant clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved. Independent senator Nick Xenophon said he was told earlier in the year by human rights advocates that Mr Prabowo - who narrowly lost the presidential elections to Mr Joko in October - was 'very sympathetic' to clemency. As well, he could see that the executions of Chan and Sukumaran could damage relations between Australia and Indonesia. 'I was advised at the time that it would be a bad idea to approach him, so I didn't,' Senator Xenophon told ABC radio. 'One view was that it would enrage President Widodo and make matters worse, and I guess we'll never know.' . This comes after a senior Indonesian government official praised the firing squad that executed Bali Nine pair and six other convicted drug traffickers. ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for their work.  . 'All shots were done perfectly. These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January,' he said. . Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March. Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo (right) applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for the good job that they did. Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country, as he dismissed Australia's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction'. He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday, hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders. 'I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing. It is not a fun job,' he said. 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs. We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came. What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes. . 'Therefore, I would like to offer my condolences, on the execution of those who were on the death row, to their families, to their home countries. 'Once again, we are not against the countries, but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation's survival.' Mr Prasetyo (second right) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly' at the execution. The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions  as 'cruel and unnecessary' and announced he would withdraw Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson. 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,' he said. 'I think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere.' Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest. 'Within a month or two, they will come back. That's the signal of protest, we did that too,' he said, referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan. Rest in peace: Myuran Sukumaran (foreground) and Andrew Chan (back) were executed . Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others. 'This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes,' he told reporters in Cilacap. . 'The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last,' he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely' this time. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo raised his nation's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador. 'Our sovereignty must be respected,' he told reporters. 'We're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well.' . Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect' Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, is widely regarded as weak. He has ignored international pressure to cease executions of foreign drug convicts.  .  .",

    "document": "There can be no doubt that the bone-jarring collisions we see on Saturday will be far more substantial than the flick from David Beckham's right boot which led to Diego Simeone collapsing in apparent agony on the same pitch 17 years ago. This mouth-watering repeat of last year's European Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne's famous Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be no place for faint-hearted souls like Argentina's 1998 football World Cup captain. Instead, Saracens head coach Mark McCall wants warriors. Twenty-three of them, to be exact, if every player in his squad gets on to the field to face a Clermont Auvergne team that made Aviva Premiership champions Northampton look like a pub side only two weeks ago. Veteran fly half Charlie Hodgson will run the show for Saracens against Clermont on Saturday . England centre Brad Barritt will captain Mark McCall's side against at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Owen Farrell has recovered from a knee injury and has been named on the bench for the big clash . CLERMONT AUVERGNE: N Abendanon; N Nakaitaci, J Davies, W Fofana, N Nalaga; B James, L Radosavljevic; V Debaty, B Kayser, D Zirakashvili, J Cudmore, S Vahaamahina, J Bonnaire, D Chouly (capt), J Bardy. SARACENS: A Goode; C Ashton, M Bosch, B Barritt (capt), C Wyles; C Hodgson, R Wigglesworth; M Vunipola, J George, P Du Plessis, G Kruis, J Hamilton, M Itoje, B Vunipola, J Burger. Kick-off: 3.15pm, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Etienne. . TV: LIVE on BT Sport 1 from 2.30pm. Referee: George Clancy (Ireland). Jacques Burger, Clermont's nemesis in last year's semi-final, is back after a one-match ban while 20-year-old Maro Itoje will take the other flank in a Saracens pack that must match Clermont's monstrous eight for physicality. 'Experience tells us that in games as big and as difficult as this you need your warriors,' McCall said this week. Saracens' experience also tells them Clermont can be beaten. This time last year the sides met at the same stage and produced what many believed to be a seminal performance in Sarries' history as Vern Cotter's men were crushed 46-6 at Twickenham. There were warriors aplenty for the men in black that day as Saracens powered into their first European Cup final only to fall short against a Jonny Wilkinson-inspired Toulon in the final. Maro Itoje has been named to start at blindside flanker following a string of impressive performances . On Saturday, a similarly Herculean effort will be required against a Clermont side who have almost forgotten how to lose at their own Stade Marcel-Michelin. Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, however, is not home territory for either club, though Saracens travel as underdogs. 'Playing away from home has always galvanised us,' said Saracens battle-hardened centre Brad Barritt — captain in the absence of Alistair Hargreaves. 'Early in this team's evolution we spoke about going to these arenas where Saracens had never won and knocking over another hurdle. This is another chance to make an everlasting memory and take a massive scalp. It's something that brings the best out of this team.' Clermont have an array of attacking talent that can hurt Saracens with Wesley Fofana to the fore . Few teams know each other better, with last year's semi-final still fresh in the memory as well as two pool games this season which saw honours shared. This week McCall invited Jim McGuinness, the former Donegal gaelic football manager and current Celtic psychologist, to address the squad before training. McCall said: 'When Jim took over in 2010 Donegal hadn't won a game for three seasons and hadn't won a championship in 19. 'He took them on a journey over four seasons where they won the all-Ireland in year two and have been Ulster champions in three out of the four years he coached them. It seemed like a very similar journey to our own. Our players were captivated.' Jacques Burger (centre) was a standout performer in Saracens' 46-6 victory at Twickenham last season . Saracens are able to call on linchpin No 8 Billy Vunipola, who starts in a back row alongside Burger and Itoje who, standing 6ft 5in and weighing 18st 2lb, epitomises the modern-day rugby player. Vunipola was cleared on Tuesday of intentionally head-butting Leicester's Mathew Tait in last weekend's Premiership encounter. . With veteran fly-half Charlie Hodgson in the form of his life and Owen Farrell on the bench after recovering from the knee injury which kept him out of England's Six Nations campaign, Saracens are close to full strength. Barritt believes experience will be crucial. 'We have a squad who have been there and done it,' he said. 'We have experienced those highs and lows of winning a Premiership, losing in the final of the Premiership and consistently getting to the latter stages of the Europe. Those experiences made us a stronger and better team. McCall (above) invited  ex-Donegal gaelic football manager Jim McGuinness to speak to his side this week . 'We feel like we're in a great position for the final run-in of the season. We've won the last six or seven games. In these big games it's often about adapting to the situation and we know we have got a few strings to our bow.' Against a Clermont side capable of striking from anywhere on the field, Saracens will need all those strings. Billy Vunipola was cleared on Tuesday of intentionally head-butting Leicester full back Mathew Tait.",

Huge waves as high as 40 feet smashed glass panels, shattered plates and cups – and left many on-board violently seasick as the boat pitched from side to side. A Sydney harbour pilot finally boarded this morning and the ship, carrying 2,500 holidaymakers and 1,500 crew, docked at the Overseas Passenger Terminal at around 10am. . Scroll down for videos    . The 2500 passengers on board a cruise ship, which has been stranded at sea due to wild weather conditions, have finally arrived at Sydney Harbour this morning. Holidaymakers were due to disembark the Carnival Spirit on Tuesday morning but the Sydney storm prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. The port in Sydney reopened on Wednesday morning, allowing the ship made its way through the harbour to dock. Passengers from the cruise ship Carnival Spirit disembark at Sydney's Overseas Passenger Terminal. 'We're so relieved to just get off,' passenger Courtney Randall said as she disembarked the liner. 'Inside everyone was sick, it was really quite rocky.' 'Everyone is ready to get off,' Debbie from Cherrybrook told ABC radio as the ship headed towards the shore. Another passenger told the Sydney Morning Herald  of the horror and panic of being on board while the ship was battered had left her traumatised. 'At one stage, I looked out the window and one of the waves crashed up against the glass. I freaked out and closed the curtains. I couldn't deal with it,' Athanasia Georgoudakis, from Yagoona in Sydney's south-west, told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'This is the last [cruise]. If I want to go on holiday I will catch a plane. I will not take another cruise, never.' Vacationers were put on edge as 'a lot of water' coming through glass panels and some of the crew were also frightened by the experience. One passenger has told how many travellers have been 'vomiting for two days' due to rough seas conditions. A spokesperson for the cruise liner said that boarding is expected to commence at 2.30pm for their modified 7-day Isle de Pines vacation, with plans to set sail by 7pm.  A camera on the cruise captures the moment it finally enters Sydney Harbour on Wednesday morning. One member of staff, who had worked on cruise ships for six years said that he had been sea sick and was very relieved to be back on shore. 'I was pretty scared of the roughness because I've experienced nothing like that before,' he told Daily Mail Australia, asking not to be identified. Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves, which began crashing into the ship late on Monday. . It had been due to dock on Tuesday morning but Sydney Harbour was closed to traffic as conditions were so bad. The crew had pleaded for calm on board the ship, saying it was built to withstand the storm, which has been described as a 'once in a century' weather event. Daily Mail Australia spoke to several new passengers, who were among many waiting to check in their luggage for their week-long journey aboard the ship. One young Gold Coast couple (pictured) Caleb Dias, 18, and Chloie Rhodes, 17, could not wait to jump on board as they had been planning this trip for nearly a year. Dr Marie-Therese Proctor, of Picton which is 80km south-west of Sydney, is travelling with her teenage daughter Serena (pictured together) and told Daily Mail Australia she is confident the weather is going to clear up for their week-long trip which begins today. 2500 passengers on board the Carnival Spirit are at the mercy of the wild seas as storms batter the east coast - with the massive swell, seen from video images shot from on-board, showing just how treacherous and stomach churning the conditions are. The cruise ship Carnival Spirit has been damaged and stranded outside Sydney Harbour on Tuesday morning. The cyclonic winds battering Sydney have also caused drama for passengers on board cruise liner the Carnival Spirit which is heading south after being prevented from docking because of the heavy seas. Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves. While the ship was stuck at sea, one passenger told the Daily Telegraph that 'there was a large wave that hit at 7.30 last night that tore one of the doors off causing a whole lot of water to come flooding through the deck'. 'Even as we speak the ship is creaking and moaning,' passenger Kurt Foster said. 'Last night was absolutely horrendous. In the room all the cupboard doors were flying open and everything on the bench tops was flying off. 'One crew member has been working here for 10 years and he reckons it's the roughest he's seen.' . At 8.25am on Wednesday, Carnival Cruise Line Australia finally posted a message on their Facebook page that their ship had been cleared to dock. ‘(We) have been notified that the port in Sydney is now open to ship traffic and we're happy to say the weather has improved to allow safe entry into the port,' it read. The Carnival Spirit has 2500 passengers on board, stranded outside of Sydney Harbour because of the city's wild weather. 'The pilot is now on board and ship is proceeding to the terminal and is expected to be alongside no later than 10am. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port. 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open.’. Damage to the 293m Carnival Spirit was minor and it was scheduled to depart of for a seven-day Isle de Pines cruise this evening.

Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore as the cruise ship Carnival Spirit remains stranded outside Sydney Harbour. One young Gold Coast couple Caleb Dias, 18, and Chloie Rhodes, 17, could not wait to jump on board as they had been planning this trip for nearly a year. 'I guess we're a bit nervous but I think we'll be fine and we even bought some travel sickness tablets just in case,' Mr Dias said. Dr Marie-Therese Proctor, of Picton which is 80km south-west of Sydney, is travelling with her teenage daughter Serena and told Daily Mail Australia she is confident the weather is going to clear up. 'It's disappointing that we lost one day of travel as we were supposed to leave yesterday and we would have cancelled our trip all together if it didn't sail today,' Dr Proctor said. 'But I am looking forward to some quality mother and daughter time on this trip plus I trust the crew's decision to go ahead with the trip in these conditions.' .

Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday afternoon. Multiple photos of Mr Besim on his social media pages show him posing with one raised index finger, a symbol that other ISIS supporters have also frequently used. He is one of two 18-year-old men police arrested for allegedly planning an 'ISIS inspired' attack on an Anzac Day ceremony. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured) Haider was killed by police last year after he attacked officers with a knife, and is believed to have planned an ISIS-like attack. The two alleged ringleaders of the Anzac Day plot reportedly attended Haider's funeral. The information comes after police held one of the alleged ringleaders in jail under tough new terror laws, despite not being charged. . The man, who cannot be identified due to suppression orders, could be held 14 days after police applied for a Preventive Detention Order. Another man, Sevdet Ramadan Besim, 18,  was charged with planning to carry out an  attack. Both men often visited frequented the controversial Al-Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale.

Decision: The schoolgirl leaves across the street from her preferred school but instead will have to head to Shooters Grove Primary, which is around two miles away. Mrs Briggs had believed Broomhill Infants School in Sheffield, where Charlotte is a student, was a feeder school to Lydgate Junior, so only put one school on Charlotte's admission form. The mother - who works in IT for Sheffield City Council and is married to financial planner Simon, 55, - also believed the short distance from her home to the school would also be a deciding factor. But the council said the school Charlotte attends has never been a feeder school and advised parents to always submit three preferences when applying. Charlotte is in the catchment area but the school is oversubscribed, so children who also live in the area but go to the correct feeder school were given a place above her. Mrs Briggs is now planning to appeal the decision made by the authority after Charlotte was given a spot at Shooters Grove Primary - more than two miles away. She said: 'I know that lots of parents are in similar positions but what is different here is that not only are we in catchment, we live about as close to the school as possible. . Rejected: Charlotte Briggs was refused a place at Lydgate Junior School (above) in Sheffield, even though she can see it from her bedroom window. 'Parents park outside our house when dropping their children off at Lydgate Juniors. 'The council uses an \"as the crow flies\" criteria for working out who lives nearer in the event of over subscription within catchment and if I look out of my landing window, all that stands between us and the school are the Kings Court OAP flats and a couple of houses. 'I've been told Broomhill is no longer a feeder school and all the places have been allocated at other infant schools. 'I have looked at bus timetables. I wouldn't be able to drop Charlotte off at school and get into town for work. It would take an hour and five minutes each way twice a day. I simply wouldn't be able to do it.' Jayne Ludlam, the council's executive director of children, young people and families said: 'We do understand that it is difficult if a child cannot be offered a place at their preferred school. . 'We always encourage parents to submit three preferences in case their first preference cannot be accommodated. . Alternative: The seven-year-old was instead offered a place at Shooters Grove - more than two miles away. 'Broomhill Infant School is not and has never been a linked feeder school to Lydgate Junior School and a member of the Admissions Team attended Broomhill in October 2014 to offer help and advice to parents before applying. 'If only one preference is submitted and cannot be accommodated, a place may have to be offered at the nearest school with available places. This may be a school outside the catchment area, if no other preferences were requested. 'If a family has specific reasons for seeking a place at an oversubscribed school they can submit an appeal to the independent appeals panel, which will convene in June and July.' Mrs Briggs said she has contacted her local prospective parliamentary candidates in Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's constituency of Sheffield Hallam - but has yet to receive a reply. . She added: ‘The school she has been allocated is down into one valley and down the other side. It's ridiculous. If we were to go by bus it would be a bus into town and then another one out. ‘It would take an hour and five minutes to get to school. We are appealing the decision but we won't find out until July what the outcome is, which is very late for us to plan and buy uniforms.’.",

    "document": "A paramedic who pretended he was gay to get close to women before sexually assaulting them has been struck off the medical register. Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. . Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. . His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. . She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. . Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. . 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges. 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.'  . When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'",

    "document": "Shay Given has revealed the pain still lingers from Ruud Gullit’s decision to snub him for the 1999 FA Cup final between Newcastle and Manchester United. The Republic of Ireland goalkeeper played every round of Newcastle’s run but was dropped in favour of Steve Harper for the Wembley showpiece, won 2-0 by Sir Alex Ferguson’s side. Given has yet to experience a truly fulfilling visit to the national stadium. He played in the 1998 FA Cup final loss to Arsenal, as well as the semi-final defeat to Chelsea in 2000. Shay Given will start for Aston Villa against Liverpool in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . He has an FA Cup winners’ medal from 2011 but was an unusued substitute for the final against Stoke with Joe Hart in net. He is out to make amends against Liverpool. ‘It was nice to be part of winning it with Man City but when you don’t play it doesn’t have the same value,’ he said. ‘I don’t know where my medal is to be honest. ‘1999 was a bit of a slap in the face. Do you ever get over it, I suppose? It’s not an easy one. Ruud Gullit didn’t even tell me, he got the goalkeeping coach Terry Gennoe to tell me I wasn’t playing. ‘But you can’t look back in football, you’ve just got to look forward. I’d love to win a trophy and make a bit of history at Aston Villa.’. The 38-year-old has played in all four of Villa's FA Cup matches this season and has kept two clean-sheets. Villa manager Tim Sherwood confirmed Given will start on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39. Manager Tim Sherwood has confirmed Given, who turns 39 tomorrow, will keep his Cup place rather than be replaced by No 1 Brad Guzan. Given has played every round of the competition, beginning under Paul Lambert, and make key saves along the way. . Given admitted he felt matches of this magnitude had passed him by when he was out on loan at Middlesbrough last season, as Lambert jettisoned players he needed to remove off the wage bill. Last April, he was in the dugout assisting Villa’s former manager as coach when Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa were suspended. ‘I am employed by Aston Villa and I felt I could help out,’ said Given. ‘Life is too short to have grudges.’. Sherwood watched his Villa side in training as they prepare for the Sunday's crunch clash. Sherwood, his former Blackburn teammate, has provided a ‘new lease of life’. . ‘Tim is a very ambitious guy, he wants to keep the club in the Premier League and win the FA Cup. There have been occasions this season where people have seen the angry side. But ten minutes later he is putting his arm around the same player. One of his best skills is man management. He knows how to get the best out of people.’. Given has regained his place in the Ireland team and is wants to play at Euro 2016 should his country qualify. He would also like to take the goalkeeping shirt off Brad Guzan in the Premier League. He has a year left on his contract this summer and will discuss his prospects with Sherwood. ‘This run has shown I’m still capable and hopefully it gives a seed of doubt into the manager’s head as well that if he wants to mix it up in the Premier League.’ . Aston Villa defeated rivals West Brom 2-0 in the last round to book their semi-final appearance at Wembley.  .",

    "document": "An architect who arranged to meet a woman on a blind date raped her several hours later while telling her 'girls say no but they don't really mean it,' a court has heard. Adam Leheup, 34, allegedly  insisted on having sex with the 25-year-old woman despite her shouting: 'No, no.'  . Leheup met the woman on July 9, 2013 after arranging to meet on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Adam Leheup met with his alleged victim after making contact with her through the 'Let's Date App' They arranged to meet under the clock on Waterloo Station before crossing the bridge over to the Embankment where they went to Gordon's Wine Bar. . Leheup, who is a University of Greenwich graduate and technical co-ordinator on the £500m Nine Elms Point development, denies raping the woman. . Blackfriars Crown Court heard that Leheup missed his last train home to Hersham, Walton-on-Thames, so the alleged victim allowed him to come home with her to her flat in Camden during the early hours of July 10, 2013. He said they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. In a statement to police, the alleged victim said: 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked. He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: \"No\" a lot, but he was not listening. 'I was saying: \"No\", but he thought it was a joke or something. Then maybe he realised I was serious and he calmed down. 'He said: \"Girl’s say: No, but they don’t mean it.\" I just wanted him out. My flatmate said she was going to call the police, but he laughed at her and said it would just be a domestic.' Prosecutor Mr Ish Sheikh told the court the couple met on dating app ‘Let’s Date’ - which connects users who mutually find each other attractive - and had two bottles of wine at Gordons Wine Bar, Embankment after meeting and walking across Waterloo Bridge. It was so late Leheup had missed his last train and his date agreed to put him up for the night. 'She made it clear nothing would happen and they went to a second bar, \"Joe’s\", in Camden where they had mojitos. Leheup went to Gordon's Wine Bar, pictured, with his alleged victim before going back to Camden together. Leheup has pleaded not guilty to raping the 25-year-old girl at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured. 'He started kissing my neck and it made me a bit uncomfortable, but it wasn’t vicious or nasty and later I did kiss him back. We were getting on well,' the woman told police in a video interview. 'The kissing had got a bit more aggressive, stuff I did not like, his hand on my throat, which makes me vulnerable. 'I said: \"Nothing is going to happen.\" I’m not that kind of girl. Mr Sheikh added: 'The defendant was also a bit funny towards her when she was talking to other men at the bar.' They returned to the complainant’s flat in the early hours. 'She shares it with two others and when they got into the bedroom she changed into jogging bottoms and a top and got into bed, where the defendant joined her without any clothes on at all. 'He started kissing her and got on top of her and she was shouting: \"No, no,\" and to stop, but he did not take any heed of these cries and touched her with his fingers.' Partial intercourse occurred for a very short time and the young woman managed to get away and told Leheup: 'Why did you do that when I said no?' Mr Sheikh explained: 'One of the flatmates was woken because of the shouting and told Mr Leheup to leave, but he wouldn’t because he said he had work the next day and wanted to wait until the trains started running. The flatmate threatened to call the police and Leheup clambered down scaffolding outside the balcony door, but was arrested on the way to the underground station. When questioned by police the defendant said his date did not object to being touched intimately by him. 'He said he was fondling her breasts and there was no talk of sex one way or the other. 'When they arrived at the bedroom he said she said words to the effect of: \"Welcome to my crack den.\" 'He said he took her bra off because she wanted a back massage with some oil and they began kissing. 'He said he got on top of her her and she then freaked out and as soon as she did he got off her,' explained Mr. Sheikh. 'He said he climbed down the scaffolding to avoid a confrontation. 'When she was shouting: \"No\" he should have known she was not consenting. He was not going to take no for an answer that night.' The young woman admits she was under the influence of alcohol. 'I was probably more drunk than I should have been. I was feeling a bit giddy, a bit tipsy, but I was not falling over.' The trial continues.  .

But attempting to recreate these amazing pictures is now much more difficult - and in some cases impossible - as a result of a clampdown on the use of drones for photographic purposes. New Zealand photographer Amos Chapple travelled the world during the 18 months with a quadcopter in his backpack between 2012 and 2014 when it was easier to take aerial pictures using a drone. Since then restrictive laws and regulations have been implemented across the world, due to privacy concerns, commercial rights and worries about damage to property or crashes in the air with other aircraft. . From capturing the street scene in Barcelona to the majestic glory of the Taj Mahel, his photographs of some of the world’s most far-flung and enchanting places could become ‘one of a kind’ as he re-posted them under a new blog post: 'My Aerial Drone Shots Would Be Totally Illegal Today'. ‘There was a window of about 18 months where it was possible to fly these things anywhere and people were excited to see it’, Mr Chapple told Business Insider. ‘I’m glad I made use of that time.’. Scroll down for video . The Lotus Temple in Delhi, India. The photograph was taken using a camera mounted on a quadcopter drone - offering a whole new perspective on the incredible building. The structure is the centre of the Bahai'i faith in Delhi and was designed by an Iranian exile. Mr Chapple visited India with his drone to take this stunning picture of the Taj Mahal.

High above Barcelona, clouds while through the pillars of Sagrat Cor Church. The authorities in charge of sites and cities like that have introduced tough new regulations to stop similar pictures being taken in the future, over privacy concerns and commercial rights. Mr Chapple travelled across Europe on his photographic mission, visiting the star fort at Bourtange, Netherlands, for these pictures. The Sultan Ahmed Mosque - or the 'Blue Mosque' - in Istanbul, Turkey is seen against a much wider backdrop thanks to this birds-eye view. The aerial view of Barcelona showcase the octagonial city blocks, designed to allow light and space on the street corners. Chapple captured a 'unique' perspective of a barge chugging along the Magdeburg Water Bridge, passing over the Elbe river in Germany. Russian holidaymakers might not have spotted they were being photographed as they lay on a beech in Abkhazia - and privacy is one of the reasons authorities across the world have clamped down on the use of drone photography within their borders.

With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff. Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014. .  .",

According to one well-placed source, Kate's real due date is today or tomorrow - which would tie in with comments made by the Duchess herself. Speaking during an engagement in London last month, she said that her second child is due 'mid to late April'. Scroll down for video . Due today? The Duchess of Cambridge revealed her baby is due 'mid to late April' during a visit last month. Kate, 33, who was touring the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford with Prince William, added: 'Not long to go now.' Although April 25 is widely thought to be the Duchess' due date, royal sources point out that it has never been officially confirmed as such. 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date,' a Kensington Palace source told MailOnline. 'The Duchess herself said mid to late April and there have been plenty of dates bandied around in the media but we've never confirmed anything and we never will.' However, the 25th remains a favourite with punters according to bookmakers Ladbrokes, although tomorrow and Friday are also popular and are priced at just 6/1. The Duchess is currently thought to be staying at Kensington Palace, a short drive from the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital where she is due to give birth. Popular: The 25th is the favourite but the Palace says neither that date or any other has been confirmed. Preparations: The police were seen making final checks ahead of the birth outside the Lindo Wing yesterday. Yesterday, police could be seen searching the area in preparation for the Duchess' arrival and were seen peering under traffic cones and taking lamp posts apart. According to a statement released by Kensington Palace the same day, the new baby's father, Prince William, has  finished his Air Ambulance training early and will now avoid the two-hour dash from Norfolk that some had predicted. 'The Duke of Cambridge has completed the first phase of his in-work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with Bond Air Services earlier than anticipated,' the statement read. 'This is due to a combination of The Duke performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned. 'As he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave, he will not return to duties with Bond until that time, and will remain on unpaid leave until then.' Fans: Royal fans have also set up camp outside the hospital, among them Terry Hut, 71. Ready to go: The scenes outside the hospital are reminiscent of those seen for Prince George in 2013. Back in town: The Palace has said Prince Harry will be in London this weekend before returning to Australia. But concerns have been raised about the possibility of the royal birth clashing with official events to mark the centenary of the Dardanelles campaign, with Prince William due to attend a wreath-laying service at the Cenotaph on Saturday. The ceremony, which is also being held to mark ANZAC Day, will be mirrored by another taking place in Turkey which is due to be attended by the Prince of Wales and Prince Harry. Kensington Palace have also said that rather than return directly to Australia, where he is currently taking part in training exercises with the Australian Defence Force, Harry will briefly travel back to London instead. Harry will attend Sunday's London Marathon, which, according to Palace sources, is a long-standing commitment but one that could  be confirmed only after  his Australian army schedule had been firmed up. .  .",

A drunken restaurant owner has been banned from keeping animals after he was caught on CCTV punching, kicking and throwing his dog across the room. David Nellist, 38, of Keswick, Cumbria was foiled after a neighbour heard the young spaniel cross called Coco 'screaming'. . Nellist was sentenced to two months in prison, suspended for 18 months, banned from keeping animals for five years, ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work and pay costs of £1,580 at Workington Magistrates Court in Cumbria last week. . The court was told the incident took place early on Monday January 19 at the tapas bar Nellist co-owned at the time of the incident in Keswick. RSPCA inspector Martyn Fletcher said: 'A neighbour was awakened in the middle of the night by a noise that she described as \"an animal in extreme pain or distress\".' Scroll down for video . Sentenced: David Nellist, 38, has been banned from keeping animals for five years by magistrates in Cumbria. Caught on camera: Nellist was foiled after a neighbour heard the young spaniel cross called Coco 'screaming' The woman said it sounded like a scream, as if the dog was being tortured. . 'She told us the sound continued intermittently, causing her to be so concerned that she actually got up, left her home and followed the noise to the restaurant,' Mr Fletcher said. 'This was 3.30am.' CCTV footage from several cameras inside the restaurant showed Nellist beating the dog. Mr Fletcher said: 'There is no audio recorded on it, but it’s horrible to watch. 'He’s seen pursuing her relentlessly as she moves from room to room, clearly frightened and trying to get away from him. . 'He repeatedly punches her, kicks her and on two occasions picks her up by the throat and throws her across the room onto the ground. . 'It’s not difficult to imagine what might have happened had it not been for the actions of the neighbour.' Police were called to the restaurant but left after finding no obvious injuries to the animal. The RSPCA was called and after viewing the footage, Coco was seized by police on veterinary advice and placed in RSPCA care. Video contains footage some viewers may find upsetting . CCTV footage from several cameras inside the restaurant showed David Nellist, co-owner at the time, beating Coco the dog. The drunken restaurant boss caught on CCTV punching, kicking and throwing his dog across the room. On examination, the vet found no injuries but prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs based on what she had seen on the footage. In mitigation, the court heard that Nellist was drunk at the time and was appalled by his actions. Coco has since been rehomed. 'I’ve seen her since and she’s like a different dog,' Mr Fletcher added. 'She’s got a fantastic owner who has another dog too, and they’ve become great friends. . 'She’s a really cheeky girl.' Nellist admitted causing unnecessary suffering to his pet by subjecting her to unnecessary physical violence.",

    "document": "One hundred and forty-seven victims. Many more families affected. Even more broken hopes and dreams. As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official. The father of suspect Abdirahim Abdullahi is a chief in Mandera and had reported his son missing, officials said. The Islamist extremist group is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the nation that shares a border with Kenya. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, killing nearly 70 people.",

    "document": "The mighty boot of Marcelo Bosch kept the English flag flying in Europe as the Argentinian kicked Saracens through to the Champions Cup semi-finals with a famous last-minute penalty. No chorus of boos or whistles would stop the sweet strike rising above the 1950s tower blocks in the Colombes suburbs, with the ice cool 31-year-old mobbed by players and coaches as Racing Metro 92 were unceremoniously dumped out of the competition. It was the South American’s finest moment since he arrived on continental shores. Referee Nigel Owens was escorted off the pitch by security but his call –penalising replacement lock Fabrice Metz with 10 seconds left on the clock – was the correct decision and ensured a classic finale to match bereft or flair and finesse. . Scenes of elation as Saracens clinch victory with the last play of the match against Racing Metro 92. Marcelo Bosch kicks the match-winning penalty from long-range to snatch Saracen's a semi-final berth. Argentine Bosch raises his arms aloft after being entrusted with the final kick of the game . Bosch jumps into the arms of Rhys Gills after his successful kick as Hodgson joins the celebrations. Bosch is mobbed by his elated Sarries team-mates after his kick sails over the posts for the win. England's first team through to the semi-finals in the European Rugby Champions Cup semis celebrate.  . RACING METRO 92: Dulin, Imhoff, Chavancy, Roberts, Thomas, Sexton, Machenaud, Ben Arous, Szarzewski, Ducalcon, Charteris, Van Der Merwe, Lauret, Gerondeau, Claassen. Replacements: Lacombe, Brugnaut, Mujati, Metz, Dubarry, Phillips, Goosen, Dumoulin. Tries: Machenaud Penalties: Machenaud (2) Conversions: Nil . Referee: Nigel Owens (Wales) . SARACENS: Goode, Ashton, Bosch, Wyles, Strettle, Hodgson, Wigglesworth, M. Vunipola, George, Du Plessis, Kruis, J. Hamilton, Wray, Burger, B. Vunipola. Replacements: Brits, Barrington, Johnston, Itoje, Brown, Hankin, De Kock, Tompkins. Tries: Nil Penalties: Hodgson (2), Goode, Bosch Conversions: Nil . ‘The last time I kicked to win the game was when I was 21 and playing for an amateur club in Argentina,’ said Bosch. 'It was from more or less the same range and it was against our clasico rivals. It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. ‘I tried to be as relaxed as possible. We had the wind in our face and I didn’t want to force it. I tried not to think about what it represented and I said, “Why not? I can take it.” The rest is history. With kicks like this, you’re either the hero or the bad guy - I’m happy that it went my way.’. It was the sort of strike that was associated with Ronan O’Gara during his illustrious playing career with Munster and Ireland. The retired No 10, now kicking coach for the Top 14 side, watched helplessly from the stands of the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir as the ball sailed between the posts to set up a knockout meeting with Clermont in Saint Etienne. .

Sarries full back Alex Goode (centre) evades Racing's Welsh centre Jamie Roberts (right) Racing and France scrum-half Maxime Machenaud crosses for the only try of the first half in outer Paris. CLERMONT v SARACENS, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, St Etienne, Saturday, April 18, 3.15pm (GMT) TOULON v LEINSTER, Stade Vélodrome, Marseille, Sunday,     April 19, 3.15pm (GMT) Racing are a team who, in their early years, would play wearing berets and bow ties. They would drink champagne at half time but this was an abrasive and at times unabsorbing encounter, offering little to inspire the Parisian painters couched on the sidelines to capture the moments of magic. The partisan home crowd were angered by two of Owens’ decisions in the opening quarter, with the Welshman not penalising Alex Goode for a block on French winger Teddy Thomas and scratching off a potential try for Dimitri Szarzewski because of a knock on. Charlie Hodgson kicked two first-half penalties – either side of a 27th minute try for Maxime Machenaud after Saracens lost an attacking scrum - Jim Hamilton was shown a yellow card, the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one-point advantage. ‘We weren't great in the first half, even though we had a very strong wind,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We were unable to build any pressure. Playing into that very strong wind and with Jonny Sexton playing No 10 for the opposition, being 6-5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb.  . Marcelo Bosch is an Argentine utility back who moved to Europe in 2006 to play for Biarritz. He joined Saracens in the 2013-14 season and has featured predominantly at centre. He is not Saracens’ first-choice kicker - Owen Farrell, Charlie Hodgson and Alex Goode are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike. It’s earned him cult status with the Allianz Park crowd, who chant ‘Bosch, Bosch, Bosch’ whenever he lines up one of his kicks. As a teenager, Bosch played football in Buenos Aires but claims that it was always his dream to play rugby in England. He married Augustina last summer and they are expecting twins. . Bosch's football skills aid his powerful kicking. Racing Metro 92 winger Teddy Thomas shows his speed to avoid Chris Wyles and escape the in-goal area. Sarries' stand-in captain Hodgson places his grubber kick underneath Wenceslas Lauret. Racing Metro and Ireland fly-half Jonny Sexton (left) locks horns with Sarries winger David Strettle. Strettle is upended going for a high ball against Racing's Brice Dulin, who escapes a yellow card . ‘But that's where it turned around and I'd say our second half performance was as courageous, brave and hard working as I've seen. We went hunting and kept knocking them down, scrapping for absolutely everything. Our rugby could have been better and it wasn't a beauty of a match, but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance.’. Cigarette smoke filled the air and, having never previously progressed from the pool stages, the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure. Racing did most of the running but Saracens edged further ahead, with Goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty. Wales and Racing centre Jamie Roberts threatened in attack, but was hauled off in the 52nd minute. Bosch then tackled his countryman Juan Imhoff just short of the line – although the pitch-length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass – and Billy Vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a Racing attack. But Saracens were unable to build upon their lead and, just past the hour mark, Racing narrowed the gap thanks to three points from Machenaud. A game of kick tennis ensued and the French No 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later. The blue and white flags were waving and the bass drum was beating but, sacrebleu, Metro tried to run down the clock. Then Metz came flying off his feet at the crucial moment. Bosch stepped up for the penalty and, after a short run up, his kick floated gracefully between the sticks. .

But according to his trainer, former professional boxer Terry Claybon, it took a huge amount of work to get the 34-year-old actor ripped for the shoot, including six months of training before filming even started.  . He also worked out for an incredible six hours per day, including 2,000 sit ups, 1,000 each morning and the same at night. . Of course, Jake had to work even harder to get in shape because he had just  dropped approximately 30lbs to play freelance crime reporter Lou, who stumbles upon the dangerous underworld of Los Angeles in Nightcrawler. Scroll down for video . Blood, sweat and tears: According to his trainer, it took a huge amount of work to get Jake Gyllenhaal ripped for Southpaw, including six months of training before filming started, 2,000 sit ups and six hours of training each day. Much thinner: The 34-year-old lost 30 pounds for 2014 thriller Nightcrawler and had  to put that weight  back on plus 15lbs of muscle . He not only returned to his normal weight - but he then put on another 15 pounds of pure muscle to play the desperate fighter Billy Hope. His trainer Claybon told Yahoo: 'Gradually we built up, day-by-day, to 2,000. It takes time to do that', and revealed that his exercise regime included, 'three hours of boxing in the morning and three hours of strengthening, conditioning, and cardio at night.' . Speaking about his weight loss for Nightcrawler, Jake told Us Weekly: 'I knew that [Lou] was literally and figuratively hungry, [so I got into the] mode where I was always a bit hungry. Beaten: The trailer shows a muscular Gyllenhaal bloodied and bruised by an opponent in the boxing ring. Bulking up: Jake poses here with his trainers, including former boxer Terry Claybon (second from right), who was responsible for whipping the once-scrawny actor into shape. Gyllenhaal also attended several boxing matches to watch how real fighters move in the ring. 'It's not different than getting into character for anything. It's more about believing where you are and being present where you are. Who's to say what the process is? I have a strange one … but I love what I do.' . Claybon explained to Yahoo that Jake put back on the weight he had lost before gaining an extra 15 pounds of muscle for Southpaw. . Health experts told the Daily Telegraph that Gyllenhaal likely went on a high-protein diet, that likely included protein powder. He likely had to consume 130 grams of protein - two and a half times the daily recommended intake. . Health experts also told the Telegraph that such drastic body changes could cause long-term damage to his body. . The huge swing in Gyllenhaal's physique recalls other drastic changes actors have made in their bodies. Among the most recent and most notable is Matthew McConaughey's turn from  Magic Mike hunk to Dallas Buyers Club AIDS patient. Meanwhile, in Southpaw, Jake plays Billy Hope, a professional boxer who must rebuild his life after his wife is killed and his daughter is taken away from him. . The recent trailer opens with Gyllenhaal's understatement: 'I expected a hard fight. I put my family through a lot.' It then cuts to him in the ring bloodied and bruised as he takes a relentless pounding from an opponent, while his wife, played by Rachel McAdam and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson look on in horror, before Hope suddenly turns it around sends the other boxer to the canvass. Horrified: His wife, played by Rachel McAdam and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson can only stand by and watch ringside. Adrenelin: Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope, a boxer who allows himself take punches to fire himself up. The reason Gyllenhaal's character allowed himself to take the beating in the first place is then explained. 'The more you get hit the harder you fight, I get it,' his wife says. 'Only now you've taken way to many hits before you get off. You cant fight like that any more. Think about her.' She's talking about the couple's only daughter Leila, who is played by film newcomer Oona Laurence. The youngster is fresh from lauded performances on Broadway as Matilda in the stage adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic. But the trailer also reveals there's a much more devastating blow in store for Hope, when his wife is accidentally shot dead by a bodyguard during an altercation with he has with another boxer who had been taunting him, which McAdam's character had told him to walk away from.

The sisters have teamed up with 'Print All Over Me' - an innovative online New York-based company that allows you to digitally design your own prints - and Buffalo shoes, the brand behind the Spice Girls' trademark platforms. Introduced to the company via a mutual friend in the U.S., the girls knew it was a match made in heaven.

Quirky collab: Sister duo Jess and Stef Dadon have teamed up  with  New York company ' Print All Over Me' Cocktails and creativity: The sisters are heading to LA soon for summer to launch new shoe line 'Twoobs' The photo-shoot was their own idea, which according to Jess they 'threw together' because they didn't think the collaboration on its own had enough of their signature look that is all about over-the -top colours and accessories. While the duo look posed and polished in the pics, they let us in on a little secret, according to the 'How Two Live' girls, they insist they don't actually like modelling, despite the 1732 posts on Instagram that would suggest otherwise.

The shoes featured are also as part of the collaboration and are from the brand 'Buffalo Shoes' which are the same brand who sky-rocketed platforms into the mainstream  when they were famously worn by the Spice Girls during the 90s. 'We'd been collaborating with the guys from Buffalo shoes but we weren't sure what our following would think, so we posted a pic on Instagram and everyone has been dying over them - so it's had a great response,' says Jess. . While the  photo shoot for their current collaboration only took a quick 45 minutes, the Dadon sisters had a lot of other projects  keeping them busy. Down-to-earth duo:  45 minutes is all it took to string together the glamour shots as seen throughout. Pop princesses: The platforms  made by Buffalo Shoes are the same company made famous by the Spice Girls. First there's their new shoe label, titled 'Twoobs,' coming out in  June in America. 'We  did a shoe collaboration with Windsor Smith a year and a half ago and once we got a taste for shoes we fell in love,' says Jess. 'This first line will be all about sandals with  flat and platform soles,'she said. According to Jess,  platforms are a must because they're much more comfortable than heels - 'you’re feet won't be sore at the end of the night and you still get the height.' Flair for fashion: With a natural knack for fashion the girls are now releasing a 'how-to' book titled #howtolive. Colour craziness: 'How To Live' have become well known thanks to their colourful Australian style. Questioned why America is their first market, the sisters admit escaping to summer weather is their biggest appeal, especially as their based most of the year in Melbourne (known for it's southerly chill). 'We’re going to go for three months then decide if we'll stay on permanently. We love L.A., and we already have a fan base and  connections to the shoe industry over there so it just made sense,' says Stef. They also have a book in the works, with the very insta-worthy title ' #howtwolive' coming out in September. . Celebrity scene: In their short two and a half years of blogging they've met  Rachel Zoe and Anna Dello Russo. The book offers 36 'how-two' projects including fashion, recipes and nail art ideas. As for more collaborations? There's more on the cards but according to the girls it's still under tight wraps at the moment. Not that the fashion bloggers will need any help with exposure. The duo have met a lot of fashion royalty in the two and a half years since their blog's conception - with highlights including   Rachel Zoe at New York Fashion Week and  Anna Dello Russo when they guest edited for Elle Girl Japan. Fame and fortune aside, at the end of the day all the girls really care about is representing fashion. 'In the Australian blogging scene, everyone does the same thing, so we decided early on our goal was to bring colour into the Australian market,' says Jess. Patriotic pair: Despite business endeavours in the U.S. they take pride in representing Australian designers. And it's their vibrant and uniquely Australian approach that seems to be working. 'When we met Rachel Zoe we were wearing an amazing Australian designer Natasha Fagg and she came up to us and was like ‘\"I love what you’re wearing, you girls look so crazy,\"' says Jess. . 'It also helps that we were wearing big sunnies, very Rachel Zoe, she adds. 'We love to promote Australian designers when we're overseas. When we guest edited Elle Girl, it was so cool to have people from Japan come up and ask us who we were wearing,' she said. Despite their recent success, the duo from Melbourne remain down-to-earth about their life and even admit that despite receiving the odd gifts here and there they prefer to buy all their own clothes. 'It's flattering to receive gifts but we're a bit picky and it's always better to buy what you love and stay true to what your style is,' says Jess. .",

    "document": "Wayne Rooney knows Champions League qualification is Manchester United's to lose, making this weekend's clash with Aston Villa all the more important. Louis van Gaal's side sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings as the season enters the closing stages, boasting a five-point cushion over the chasing pack after winning so impressively at Liverpool before the international break. Juan Mata's brace earned United a deserved 2-1 triumph at Anfield to give them a buffer over the Reds, as well as fellow top-four contenders Southampton and Tottenham. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney feels the club are on course to qualify for the Champions League. United midfielder Juan Mata scored a fantastic brace against Liverpool to secure his side a 2-1 win at Anfield. The second of Mata's goals was a brilliant improvised scissor kick to give United a 2-0 lead in the second-half. However, Rooney is well aware how quickly things can change, admitting nothing less than victory will suffice when Aston Villa come to Aston Villa on Saturday. 'Yes it was (a six-pointer at Liverpool), but that means nothing if we don't beat Aston Villa on Saturday,' the United captain said. 'Obviously Arsenal play Liverpool as well, so if we can get the win against Villa that will be an even better result than Liverpool was for us. 'I think there are still eight games left. We are in a good position at the minute so it's in our own hands, so have to make sure we do it.' Rooney and several of his United team-mates only returned home from international duty on Wednesday afternoon after a technical fault on the England team plane delayed their departure from Turin. It meant an extra night in Italy, where it looked like they would be leaving after a night to forget as Graziano Pelle punished the Three Lions' poor first-half display. However, Andros Townsend's wonder strike saw England secure a 1-1 draw following a much-improved performance after half-time, when Roy Hodgson's bold substitutions paid off - as did his decision to partner Rooney with full debutant Harry Kane. The England skipper had spent the first half in midfield role as Hodgson tinkered with his side, although he is not allowing that experimentation to be an excuse. 'I think it's important in tournament football you might need that, so that's what we were doing,' the 29-year-old said. Rooney competes for the ball with Italy defender Andrea Ranocchia during Tuesday's international friendly . Rooney runs forward with the ball during the friendly match at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on Tuesday. 'We were trying a few different things out because you never know with injuries and suspensions in tournament football. The best time to do it is obviously in the friendlies. 'You could clearly see in the first half that it didn't work so I think the manager made good changes at the right time which helped us to get back into the game. 'Obviously I haven't played in midfield for a few weeks. Sometimes it is difficult to go from up front to midfield or from midfield to up front - sometimes it does take time. 'I had a few chances and could have scored, so I felt I played better when I went up front.' United team-mate Phil Jones was another to struggle away from his preferred position, looking lost at times at the base of the diamond. He looked more assured when he dropped back into defence after Chris Smalling complained of feeling unwell and was replaced by Michael Carrick late in the opening period. The 33-year-old had not played for England since October 2013 before these matches and Rooney loves having his club-mate around. 'I felt Michael Carrick was the best player on the pitch by a mile,' he said. 'He gave us great composure, he slowed the game down when we needed to and started our attacks really well.' Asked if Carrick has been under-rated throughout his career, Rooney said: 'Not from me and certainly not from Manchester United fans. 'I think he is a fantastic player. He has been a big reason why, at United, we have won so many trophies over the last few years. So from myself and his team-mates, he has not been under-estimated.' United and England midfielder Michael Carrick has been singled out for his strong performance against Italy.  .",

    "document": "A morbidly obese man who piled on the pounds thanks to a twice-daily takeaway habit and 'hated leaving the house' because of his looks has lost 19st in just one year. David Rush, 33, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, felt that he 'shouldn't go out' because of his size but lost the weight after plucking up the courage to start cycling. At his heaviest, he weighed 34st and was forced to order specialist XXXXXL clothes on the internet - the result of topping up his takeaway-heavy diet with six bags of crisps and two bottles of full-fat Coca-Cola a day. Shedding the pounds: David Rush, 33, used to weigh 34st but has shed an incredible 19st in just one year. Super slimmer: Mr Rush now weighs a slimline 15st 4lbs - down from 34st at his heaviest (right) . Embarrassed by his size and afraid of cruel comments or being forced to squeeze past people, Mr Rush says he never left the house - and never had a girlfriend. 'I hated leaving the house and going out anywhere because I didn't know if the places I would be going to were tight for space,' he explains. 'I was that big it made me feel like I shouldn't be out. My eating was awful - I would have takeaways every night for my dinner and eat junk all through the day.' But when his weight began to prevent him from walking easily, he decided to take action and ditched the takeaways in favour of a healthy meal plan. Mr Rush, who now weighs a healthy 15st 4lbs, began shedding the pounds at the rate of a stone a week but, determined to speed up the process, took up cycling. . Overindulging: Mr Rush's old diet consisted of twice-daily takeaways topped up with six bags of crisps . Mobility: He plucked up the courage to make a change after having problems walking around . He combined bike rides with 10 mile jogs and vigorous gym workouts and as a result, managed to shed a substantial 18st 10lb in just one year. A newly slimline Mr Rush says he now feels confident enough to ask women on dates and is training for a half-marathon and a 115-mile charity bike ride.  . 'Since my weight loss my life has changed so much,' he enthuses. 'I started off with walking but once I started to cycle the weight just came off and I was able to join the gym. 'I've got my social life back, I'm out with my friends and I've got myself a new small car I can fit into.' Mr Rush says he has always been big but really began piling on the pounds in his twenties after moving out of his parents' home. Unhealthy habits swiftly crept in, with Mr Rush frequently eating crisps for breakfast and takeaways for lunch and dinner. . Shrunk: Mr Rush and a friend can both squeeze into his old XXXXXL Rangers football shirt. New lease of life: Mr Rush is now training for a half-marathon and a 115-mile bike ride . Breakfast - Couple of bags of crisps. Lunch - Sausage supper from the chip shop. Dinner - Takeaway curry. Snacks - Five more bags of crisps and huge bottles of coke. Breakfast - Porridge or natural yoghurt with branflakes and fruit. Lunch - Cous cous with chicken breast and vegetables. Dinner - Fruit and yoghurt. Snacks - Fibre bars or fruit. Enjoying himself: Mr Rush, in the red jacket on the left, cycles up to 85 miles a week . All that changed when his mother Margaret began suffering from heart problems, which, combined with Mr Rush' own mobility issues, provided the wake-up call he needed. . Determined to beat the bulge, he joined Slimming World and gave his diet a makeover, eating healthy porridge for breakfast and snacking on fruit and yoghurt. . Mr Rush, who works in a storage unit facility, is now saving up for cosmetic surgery because he still has more than a stone of excess skin that he can't shift. 'It really gets me down,' he admits. 'I've lost all this weight and I'm still wearing baggy clothes cause I don't feel confident. 'It does get me down but at the same time I'm really happy with myself for what I have achieved on my own with no help. 'My life has been on such a journey this last year I feel like I'm just starting to live.' . Looking good: He now wants to complete his dramatic transformation with surgery to remove excess skin .",

Just three months after Silver himself was arrested on corruption charges, his son-in-law Marcello Trebitsch, 37, was accused of running a $7million Ponzi scheme. . The Brooklyn resident was in court on Monday as prosecutors accused him of lying to investors about stock losses and pocketing most of the money entrusted to him for trading. Trebitsch is married to Silver's daughter Michelle. Despite being a co-owner of their mutual fund, Allese Capital LLC, and a certified public accountant who 'kept the books', Michelle has not been charged in the scheme. . The son-in-law of Sheldon Silver was charged Monday with allegedly running a $7million Ponzi scheme. Silver, the former Speaker of the New York State Assembly, was charged in January for allegedly taking $4million in brides and kickbacks since 200. Silver pictured above entering court for his arraignment on February 24. The criminal complaint was filed by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bhahara, the same prosecutor who led the investigation into Silver's alleged corruption.  But sources told the New York Daily News that the investigations are unrelated. 'Investing in securities entails certain risks, but should not include the risk of being defrauded by one’s investment manager,' Bhahara said. . According to the complaint, Trebitsch took millions from investors, promising to invest their money in large-cap stocks through his mutual fund. . However, prosecutors say he only invested a fraction of the money and used the rest to finance his family and pay back other clients. Meanwhile, he allegedly lied to investors about what money he did invest, sending them fake account statements and tax forms that showed them posting positive returns along the lines of his promised 14 to 16 per cent - keeping 'enormous trading losses' secret. Trebitsch ran the scheme from 2009 through December 2014, according to the complaint. . Trebitsch has been charged with securities and wire fraud and is currently free on $500,000 bond. If convicted he faces the possibility of 40 years in prison and fines of up to $5.25million. . Father-in-law Silver was arrested in January, on charges he took $4million in brides and kickbacks since at least 2000. .

    "document": "Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside. While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling’s interview didn’t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn’t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I’m hoping that that wasn’t the whole point, as we’ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: ‘let him go’. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money’s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers. Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract. Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It’s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there’s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £100,000-a-week contract he’s turned down. But it’s only that: potential. At present, he’s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he’s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn’t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania  . And while I’d be willing to see the club give him £100k a week – possibly £120k a week - the club shouldn’t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I’m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling’s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he’s welcome to. Personally, I don’t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United. Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club. If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he’s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we’ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he’s easily worth £25-30 million. If I was FSG, I’d hold any interested club to ransom, though – double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn’t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there’s little Arsenal can offer that we can’t. Sure, they’re more financially stable but what – in terms of trophies – do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract. I think we’re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren’t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he’s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won’t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

    "document": "It's probable that Thiago Alcantara would never have signed for Manchester United even if David Moyes had wanted him. Once Pep Guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at Bayern Munich, it was pointless for United to continue their pursuit anyway,. But the fact that Moyes wasn't keen on the transfer - 'not his type' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he wasn't the right fit for United. Not that Moyes is a bad judge of a player; all managers get it wrong at some point. However, United's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout Moyes' short time at the club. Indeed, it has continued to be a problem until Michael Carrick fully recovered from injury and Ander Herrera began to find his feet. The kind of passing display Thiago delivered in Bayern's 6-1 win over Porto on Wednesday has been precisely what United have been missing. Thiago (right) heads in Bayern Munich's first goal during their 6-1 win over Porto on Tuesday night. Thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started Bayern's remarkable comeback. Thiago is congratulated on his strike by Pep Guardiola, the man who took him from Barcelona to Bayern. Without quality in that area, few teams can compete at the elite level any more. It used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height, strength and an ability to tackle. Given that most distribution emanates from deep, being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now. Moyes might quite reasonably been worried that Thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. And his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by Spain at the World Cup after pulling out with a knee injury. But there are few players in the world who can pass like Thiago. Gary Neville has spoken about how Paul Scholes was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing. Andrea Pirlo and Xavi are two more from Scholes' generation. Thiago is now elevating himself to their level. One experienced German journalist who has been watching Bayern for 35 years commented last night: 'Thiago might well be the most technically-gifted central midfielder who has ever played for Bayern.' . Thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for Bayern Munich as they crushed Porto. Thiago started his career at Barcelona but was overlooked for Cesc Fabregas (right) by boss Tito Vilanova. And no-one has invested more in Thiago than Guardiola, which is why United had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made. It was Pep who promoted him to the first team at Barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad. But when Pep left, his successor, the late Tito Vilanova, wanted Cesc Fabregas to play that role. Thiago was sidelined, hence his availability in the summer of 2013. He is very much a global footballer for the 21st century. His dad, of course, is Brazilian, the World Cup winner Mazinho; Thiago was born in Italy and raised in Spain. He opted to play for the country in which he was living, rather than that of his forefathers or his birth, and was outstanding for Spain in the European Under 21 championships in 2013, scoring a hat-trick in the final against Italy in a 4-2 win. At Barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of Thiago. Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets have that position covered. But Xavi is off to Qatar and Cesc is at Chelsea. Should Barca end up against Bayern in the Champions League semi finals, they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements. David Moyes believed Thiago may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League.  .",

The model has revealed that she carries around a pH balance urine tester kit wherever she goes to check the state of her body. In an interview with the Evening Standard, the  model admitted that the most surprising thing in her handbag is the tester kit, which she uses to check her state of alkaline. Scroll down for video . Elle Macpherson, who turned 51 last month, has revealed that she carries around a pH balance urine tester kit wherever she goes to check the state of her body. Elle said: '(The most surprising thing in my handbag is) a pH balance urine tester kit to check that I'm in an alkaline state. I believe that most ailments come from having an acidic body.' The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. . An alkaline body can be achieved by eating the right foods (lots of leafy greens) and exercising. Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times, and the Britain's Next Top Model host puts her figure down to 'variation' and 'consistency'. The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. Elle is well-known for her healthy diet and even released her own superfood product, The Super Elixir. She said: 'Variation is key. I work out 45 minutes a day, six days a week, combining hiking, water skiing, swimming and running on a beach. '(My idea of a healthy diet is) consistency and eating three healthy meals a day. Having said that, red meat, wheat and dairy don't work for me.' Like fellow models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Elle swears by the power of all things green and she is so convinced by their potency, that she's unveiled her very own brand. . Last year, Elle introduced The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements, which she describes as her drug. She hasn't aged a day! Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle, pictured, left, in 1995 and, right, in 2012,  has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times. The product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention. The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function. Speaking to FEMAIL at the time about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle said: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good. 'For years, I was taking vitamins and powders. I tried alternative medicine, acupuncture, reflexology. 'I'm a pescatarian, I don't drink, do drugs or smoke so what else can I do? I wasn't unaware of wellness but something wasn't working for me and I told my doctor \"I don't feel great\". 'She told me my body was acidic, it was down to stress, travel and lack of sleep.' Elle has co-created The Super Elixir Nourishing Protein, which is made from locally sourced organic sprouted brown rice, pea protein chocolate and Peruvian cacao and a product that the supermodel credits for helping her get ready for beach holidays . So successful was the launch of the elixir that the duo have added another product to the range: The Super Elixir Nourishing Protein. Made from locally sourced organic sprouted brown rice, pea protein chocolate and Peruvian cacao, the £45 product is a plant based complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids like those found in red meat, eggs, chicken and fish. 'Not only do I love the delicious chocolate taste but I enjoy sport and need a good source of clean protein for muscle repair, energy and of course getting ready for that beach holiday,' said Elle of the latest health product.  .  .  .  .  .",

'I've worked for Calvin Klein in their press office, designed a lip gloss for Illamasqua, a make-up brand that I love, and I've even designed capsule lines for Boy London - Rihanna has worn one of my pieces. 'I also do a bit of modelling from time to time. 'Some people notice that I was once a boy, some people don't - but I'm happy to talk about it if they ask.' Munroe began living as a woman at the age of 18 and started taking drugs friends had been prescribed at 23. It was only at 25 she was offered the hormones by her doctor. She said: 'I first started taking hormones that had been prescribed to my other trans friends. . The DJ explained: 'It was really exciting to start taking the hormones and see my body change' The stunning brunette (left and right) modelled for a variety of fashion and beauty brands including Illamasqua and Boy London - made famous by Rihanna. 'It is not something that I would recommend at all, but the process can take such a long time, and once you've made the decision to become the person you really are, you just want to get on with it. 'It was really exciting to start taking the hormones and see my body change - and soon as I was given them by my doctor. 'It's like going through puberty again so I got quite self-conscious about the way I looked and dressed, and I felt as though I started to think differently.' 'I didn't really like explaining what was going on to people as I was doing this for myself, but friends and family were curious,' she said. 'My mum found out what was going on when she noticed my chest growing - it was a shock at first but she's very supportive. 'As soon as I noticed the change in myself it was like I wasn't ashamed any more,' she said. Munroe has now been taking hormones for four years, and has embraced her new life. She said: 'When I left university I got involved in fashion and the PR industry. 'I've had the opportunity of working with some incredible brands, designers and photographers, and I just love it. 'I've done everything from club promotion, modelling, PR, and now I'm a full time DJ. 'I DJ at major club nights and private members clubs in some of the most exclusive venues in London - I feel so lucky for everything that's come my way, I would never take it for granted. 'I'm still the same person I was before, I'm just in the right body now. 'I look in the mirror and I feel like it's me who's looking back, rather than somebody I don't recognise'. Munroe, pictured with her friend Conor, says of her transition: 'It was the best decision I've ever made' Munroe and her friend Stephano at London Fashion Week. The DJ believes: 'I want people to know that it's ok to be different, and that you shouldn't be scared of being the person you are' 'I look in the mirror and I feel like it's me who's looking back, rather than somebody I don't recognise,' says Munroe. Munroe now hopes her story will encourage other young transgender men and women to feel comfortable in their own skin. Munroe said: 'I think it's important that the world understands and respects transgender people and the rights that they deserve to have within society. 'I'm so much happier now than I was growing up. 'I want people to know that it's okay to be different, and that you shouldn't be scared of being the person you are. 'I talk quite openly now about what's I've been through and frequently speak publicly about trans rights and community issues. 'I think it's important that the world understands and respects transgender people, the struggles that they face and the rights that they deserve.'",

    "document": "It was a real-life fairytale – the moment, 70 years ago, when two carefully guarded princesses were let loose to join the jubilant crowds in London celebrating the end of the Second World War in Europe. Now the adventure has been re-created in a new film, showing the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they wander incognito through the city streets. And among the most curious viewers of A Royal Night Out, released next month to coincide with the anniversary of VE Day on May 8, 1945, will be a woman who knows better than anyone what really happened on that extraordinary night. Scroll down for video . Royal Role: Canadian Sarah Gadon, left. plays a young Princess Elizabeth, pictured right. Dancing Queen: Sarah Gadon as Princess Elizabeth enjoying a night out to celebrate the end of the Second World War. Because she was there. ‘It was a Cinderella moment in reverse,’ says The Hon Margaret Rhodes, 89, first cousin to the Queen and her best friend. ‘It was wonderful bedlam. I can’t remember whose idea it was. It was just one of those things that happened.’. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from her home at Windsor Great Park, she says: ‘I think it’s one of the things that the Queen remembers with great happiness. Neither of them had ever done anything remotely similar, being let loose in a crowd like that to walk all the way from Buckingham Palace through to Trafalgar Square. ‘Everyone was kissing everybody and picking up hats and throwing them away. It was euphoria at its most euphoric!’. Mrs Rhodes, then young Margaret Elphinstone, was lodging at Buckingham Palace while working as a secretary for the military intelligence service MI6. She recalls how a small gang including 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, 15, and Mrs Rhodes’s brothers, left the Palace by the Privy Gate. ‘With the best will in the world, I can’t remember if Princess Elizabeth kissed anyone, but kisses were being thrown about very liberally,’ she says. ‘It was like we had all been living under a huge, heavy, dark cloud. And suddenly, it had gone. I’m so old now, I’m literally the only other person left alive who was there with them on VE Day.’. The Queen is said to remember the night with 'great happiness' In the film, which stars Canadian actress Sarah Gadon as the future Queen and British newcomer Bel Powley as Princess Margaret, the sisters are shown wearing cocktail dresses for their adventure. In real life, Princess Elizabeth was wearing her Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform. Mrs Rhodes says: ‘In order not to be recognised, the Queen pulled her cap right down over her eyes and one of the officers who was with us said, “Look, I’m not going about with an officer who can’t wear her cap properly,” so she had to put it back. Mrs Rhodes adds: ‘I always thought it was very clever of the King and Queen Elizabeth [the Queen Mother] to let the girls go out into the night, with all those myriad of people around them. They knew it was something the Queen and Princess Margaret would never forget.’. Princess Elizabeth is also shown forming a brief attachment with a young serviceman called Jack, who takes her gambling and to a Soho brothel. ‘That didn’t happen,’ laughs Mrs Rhodes, whose younger self does not feature in the film. ‘Apparently, Princess Margaret escapes on the top deck of a bus. That never happened.’. Princess Margaret is also shown quite drunk. ‘No! There was no possibility. We never encountered anyone offering one a drink,’ insists Mrs Rhodes, the daughter of the 16th Lord Elphinstone. One of the true scenes in the film is of the Royal party dancing the conga through the Ritz. ‘The smart old ladies having drinks were gobsmacked,’ says Mrs Rhodes, although it actually happened on VJ night, August 15 – when Britain celebrated Japan’s surrender. The princesses were protected on their VE Day jaunt by Captain Harold Campbell RN, equerry to Princess Elizabeth’s father, King George VI. ‘He was deeply disapproving of the whole manoeuvre,’ says Mrs Rhodes. The party returned to the Palace after midnight. ‘It was emancipation,’ says Mrs Rhodes. ‘I don’t think anybody realises what she has had to give up. You give up your independence. Poor Princess Margaret is dead, but that night is something I know the Queen will never forget.’. ...And she recorded a secret song tape . Friends: Margaret Rhodes, left with Princess Margaret and Elizabeth, right. By Michael Powell. The Queen and Princess Margaret recorded a secret tape of children’s songs as a touching gift for their mother on her 90th birthday, it has been revealed. Pianist and composer Laurie Holloway has told for the first time how his friend Princess Margaret phoned him with the idea, days before the Queen Mother’s milestone birthday in August 1990. He was summoned to Buckingham Palace and taken to an upstairs room ‘where there was a dark brown, walnut grand piano and two microphones. There was also a sound engineer who I think they had got in from the BBC’. Mr Holloway said the Queen, then 64, and Princess Margaret, then 59, wanted to sing quite unusual children’s songs. ‘One was called I Know Where The Flies Go In Winter Time,’ he said. ‘The Queen said they were taught them by their mother’s father, the Earl of Strathmore. We rehearsed them a few times and then we recorded them in one take each.’. Mr Holloway, 77, musical director on Strictly Come Dancing for its first three series, said the Royal sisters sang ‘very well, beautifully in fact’ during the two-hour recording session. ‘The Queen has a nice, sweet tone to her voice,’ he added. He said Margaret told him the Queen Mother loved the gift. ‘She said that when they gave it to her at Windsor, the Queen Mother said she didn’t have anything to play it on, so they had to go out to the car to listen to it. ‘Later, Prince Charles arrived and wanted to listen to it. They told him he would have to go out to the car and to everyone else’s surprise he opened a cupboard and there was all the latest stereo equipment right there.’. Sadly, the cassette went missing after the Queen Mother’s death in 2002, although Mr Holloway wonders if a copy might still exist somewhere.  .",

    "document": "Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)The question haunting Kiev is this: Who might be murdering allies of Ukraine's ousted President Viktor Yanukovych? The idea that this might be happening is not entirely new. But it muscled its way to the fore again this week with two high-profile shooting deaths in the Ukrainian capital -- one of a former member of parliament with ties to Yanukovych, the other of a Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views. Oleg Kalashnikov, the former member of parliament, was shot and killed shortly after 7 p.m. Wednesday at the entrance to his apartment block. Kalashnikov, 52, was a member of the Party of Regions, the former ruling party in Ukraine, and was close to Yanukovych. Police are investigating the death as a murder. A day later, on Thursday, journalist Oles Buzyna, 45, was killed near his home by shots fired from a dark blue Ford Focus, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. The car's license plates were reported to have been from either Latvia or Belorussia. The killings renewed speculation, sparked by earlier unusual deaths, about a conspiracy to kill people close to Yanukovych. At least three former members of parliament with the Party of Regions have reportedly committed suicide in the last seven weeks:. • On February 28, Mikhail Chechetov reportedly jumped from the window of his 17th-floor apartment in Kiev, having left a suicide note. He was suspected of having falsified the results of a parliamentary vote in early 2014 that essentially prohibited protest just as thousands of people were protesting against the Yanukovych government. • On March 9, Stanislav Melnik, a former member of parliament with the Party of Regions and the manager of several businesses in the separatist-minded eastern city of Donetsk, was found dead in his apartment near Kiev. He, too, reportedly left a suicide note. • And three days later, on March 12, Oleksandr Peklushenko, another former member of parliament, was found in his house in Zaporizhzhya, in southeastern Ukraine, dead of a gunshot wound. Police are investigating various scenarios, including suicide. Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said Peklushenko \"might have wanted to avoid punishment for using violence against protesters, which he was suspected of.\" Ukraine is deeply divided, and it has been for years. About a third of the population speaks Russian as opposed to Ukrainian. Whether the country should be drawn into the orbit of Russia or the West is a visceral issue, a question for many Ukrainians not of politics but of identity. Recent events have deepened the divide. In 2014, after Yanukovych turned his back on the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia, he was driven from office by mass demonstrations. And with Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea and its support for Russian-speaking separatists in eastern Ukraine, the internecine animosity made the ugly transformation into war. With a government toppled and armed conflict in the east, Ukrainians have reason to want each other dead. But the view of who might be responsible for the series of deaths differs starkly, according to which side of the country's divide one is on. The Opposition Bloc, the country's major opposition party, has no doubt the deaths have been politically motivated -- \"bloody terror against opposition politicians and journalists,\" the bloc's media office called them. \"It is clear oppression of those who are not afraid to criticize the government,\" it said. The government, unsurprisingly, sees things differently. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who came to office after Yanukovych was ousted, has demanded an investigation of the killings of Kalashnikov and Buzyna, his media office said. \"It is evident that these crimes have the same origin,\" the media office quoted Poroshenko as saying. \"Their nature and political sense are clear. It is a deliberate provocation that plays in favor of our enemies. It is aimed at destabilizing the internal political situation in Ukraine and discrediting the political choice of the Ukrainian people.\" And Anton Geraschenko, an adviser to the country's interior minister, took the theory one step further. \"It should not be excluded that the killings of Oleg Kalashnikov and Olez Buzyna were planned and organized from Moscow and are a part of a plan to destabilize Ukraine and further support anti-Ukrainian mood in Russian society,\" Geraschenko said.",

    "document": "Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva is relishing the prospect of a long-awaited Wembley appearance after injury robbed him of the chance three years ago. The Reds made three trips to the national stadium in 2012 after winning the League Cup and losing the FA Cup to Chelsea, but the Brazil international missed all of them with a serious knee injury sustained in the previous November. But having played his part in the 1-0 quarter-final win at Blackburn, Lucas is hoping to get his chance in the last-four encounter with Aston Villa on April 19. Lucas Leiva (right) celebrates with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after getting to the FA Cup semi-final. Lucas (left) challenges Markus Olsson as Liverpool beat Blackburn 1-0 in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. Lucas can play his first game at Wembley in a Liverpool shirt when they meet Aston Villa in the semi-final. 'Unfortunately I got an injury before we got to Wembley so I missed [the chance to play there],' he said. 'Hopefully I'll be fit and be able to play at Wembley. I've never played there, so it will be a very good experience and after many years here, to have that chance is amazing. 'I think everyone could see how hard we worked. We knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions, but I think we did well and we are so happy to get to Wembley and hopefully get to the final.' Victory over Blackburn intensified talk of the team giving captain Steven Gerrard, who departs for Los Angeles Galaxy, the perfect send-off as his birthday falls on the day of the final. However, the midfielder was suspended for the tie at Ewood Park and it was Lucas's compatriot Philippe Coutinho who made the difference with a 70th-minute strike, having scored a brilliant last-minute winner in a fourth-round replay at Bolton. Coutinho has arguably been Liverpool's best player over the last five months having not only finally seemed to have grown in stature as a playmaker but also adding goals to his armoury. 'I have known him for a very long time and I know what he's capable of doing,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'He's becoming an even bigger player for the club and he's got a long way to go in terms of age and experience, but he's already right there with the top players.' Another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against Rovers and even stopped opposite number Simon Eastwood scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the Rovers keeper came up for a throw-in in added time. The Belgium international has overcome his early-season wobbles when he seemed to be the cause of much of Liverpool's defensive frailties. He admits victory over Blackburn was important after back-to-back Premier League defeats put a huge dent in their Champions League aspirations. 'After the result against Arsenal there wasn't much time to think because we knew there was going to be a game on Wednesday,' Mignolet said. 'So we had to recover well, put the focus to Blackburn and then make sure that we did the things we wanted to do. 'I think the lads and the team responded really well, did their jobs and did what the gaffer asked us to do, and we managed to get the result we wanted. 'We needed to bounce back after two disappointing results against Manchester United and Arsenal and we did that. 'We gave something back to the fans, who have got something to look forward to now as well with a trip to Wembley. Philippe Coutinho (right) scored the decisive goal for Liverpool, drilling a low shot in off the far post . Simon Mignolet (left) produced another commanding display in goal for Liverpool at Ewood Park. Mignloet praised the Liverpool supporters and is targeting reaching the final of the FA Cup. 'They stand behind us at every single away game, they turn up in numbers and it's always nice to play in front of that crowd. 'They pushed us forward and they have something to look forward to now with a big game at Wembley. Hopefully we can get to the final as well.' As a result of Liverpool's semi-final involvement their league match at Hull scheduled for that weekend has been rescheduled for Tuesday, April 28 at the KC Stadium.  .",

Striker Charlie Austin celebrates after scoring in QPR's 3-3 draw with Aston Villa on Tuesday night. He said: 'I always thought I had everyone pulling with me and suddenly I felt some were and some weren't. I didn't know who was on my side at the end and who wasn't. 'Behind the scenes, I always thought there were one or two people with their own agendas. 'There was always talk about Tim Sherwood coming in. It was like a bit of a soap opera. 'QPR was in the paper every day. I've been at lots of other clubs, big clubs as well, where you didn't get that. That got on my nerves. That was the big problem for me. 'As soon as we lost a few games, it would begin. I always thought there was someone mischievous causing it. I'd never had that before at any club I'd been at. Redknapp was aware of constant talk of Tim Sherwood replacing him at Loftus Road earlier in the season. Former West Ham boss Redknapp believes he would have helped QPR avoid relegation. 'I didn't see the teams below us getting the same sort of headlines every other week. It wore me down a little bit.' Redknapp left the team second from bottom of the table and they are now two points from safety under the leadership of Chris Ramsey. However, Redknapp, who also claimed he did not fall out with chairman Tony Fernandes because of the club's lack of business in the January transfer window, added: 'I felt I'd have kept them up.'  .",

    "document": "House prices across the UK will rise at a fraction of last year’s frenetic pace, forecasts show. Property prices soared by 10 per cent in 2014 but will grow by just 1.5 per cent over the next 12 months. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year, it is claimed. It follows last year’s record price hike of 17.4 per cent in the capital. Economists said that the housing market had ‘got ahead of itself’ last year and would assume a much more leisurely pace in 2015. Scroll down for video . Forecasts show house prices across the UK will rise at a fraction of last year’s frenetic pace. File photo. Annual price growth across the country will then gradually accelerate again over the next five years, hitting 4 per cent by 2020. This year will be the first since 2009 that the UK as a whole out-performs London, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. This is because while prices in the capital stagnate, the housing market is still performing well in the East and South-East, and parts of the Midlands and North of England. But the CEBR said this victory for the provinces would be short-lived, since the London market will also recover in 2016. Prices there are set to rise by 2.7 per cent next year, above the national average of 2.3 per cent. London homes will also suffer no more price falls in the foreseeable future – and are forecast to see annual growth of an estimated 4.7 per cent by 2020. The predictions from economists at the think-tank were upgraded from their forecast in January, when they suggested average prices would fall this year. They said that radical changes to stamp duty had given the market a boost. In recent years many Britons had been deterred from moving home for fear of the punitive tax on house purchases. The tax was charged on the whole value of a property and successive governments had failed to increase thresholds, trapping growing numbers of families above a £125,000 threshold. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year. File photo. But, in December, the Coalition overhauled the system, replacing the unfair ‘slab’ structure with gradually increasing rates, which cut tax bills for the vast majority of movers. . Economist Scott Corfe, of the CEBR, said: ‘House price growth in the UK will rise much slower than last year – but it will still be positive. ‘The market got a bit ahead of itself last year, and at the end of 2014 it began slowing down and plateaued. ‘It has now started to pick up again outside London. We are still not building enough houses to keep pace with population growth so, as long as we have a shortage of supply, prices will keep rising. ‘House prices will continue to grow faster than inflation.’. It was a different story in London, however, where he said interest from overseas buyers had dwindled, pushing down prices. While the stamp duty changes meant lower bills for the majority, those buying million-pound homes have been hit by higher rates – deterring international investors and many wealthy Londoners. Mr Corfe said: ‘Stamp duty reform, as well as the depreciation of the euro against the pound – making London more expensive for European buyers – has affected prices in the capital. ‘Uncertainty around the general election and fears of a mansion tax [under Labour’s plans] may have also driven down demand since the start of the year.’ .  .",

    "document": "Tokyo (CNN)It's a bird -- It's a plane -- It's an insanely fast Japanese bullet train. A Japan Railway maglev train hit 603 kilometers per hour (374 miles per hour) on an experimental track in Yamanashi Tuesday, setting a decisive new world record. A spokesperson said the train spent 10.8 seconds traveling above 600 kilometers per hour, during which it covered 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles). That's nearly 20 football fields in the time it took you to read the last two sentences. Takeo Ookanda, who runs an exhibition center next to the test track, said witnesses erupted with excitement and applause when the new record was set. \"I was moved just like many other visitors here today,\" he told CNN. \"This maglev project... (increases) the hope that Japan can have a good growth again in the future.\" The train broke its own record from last Thursday, when it ran at 590 kilometers per hour (366 miles per hour) on a test track. That beat the old record of 581 kilometers per hour (361 miles per hour), which was set in 2003 during another Japanese maglev test. Right now, China operates the world's fastest commercial maglev, which has hit 431 kilometers per hour (268 miles per hour) on a route through Shanghai. By contrast, the fastest train in the United States, Amtrak's Acela Express, is only capable of 241 kilometers per hour (150 miles per hour), though it usually plods along at half that speed. Unlike traditional trains, maglev trains work by using magnets to push the train away from the tracks and drive the train forward. Japan's maglevs don't use metal tracks — instead, they float nearly 10 cm (4 inches) above special guideways, allowing for frictionless movement. Japan Railways has been testing their train to figure out the best operational speed for a planned route between Tokyo and Nagoya, scheduled to begin service in 2027. That trip can take nearly 5 hours by car. But in the future, a maglev train could finish the journey in 40 minutes. READ MORE: The future of transportation will blow your hair back.

    "document": "Scott Kelley, now 50, has been arrested a decade after he fled the U.S with stepdaughter Mary Nunes, and her mother Genevieve Kelley. A teacher who fled the U.S. with his stepdaughter and her mother ten years ago has finally given himself up in Costa Rica. Scott Kelley, now 50, and stepdaughter Mary Nunes, now 19, gave surrendered at the U.S. embassy on Monday and were flown back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, where Kelley was arrested. The pair fled New Hampshire in 2004 along with Genevieve Kelley, Mary's mother, during a custody dispute with Mark Nunes, Genevieve's former husband and Mary's father. Genevieve, now 50, handed herself in last November, but refused to give up the location of her husband and daughter, who had not been seen for a decade until this week. Speaking to People magazine, Scott Kelley said: 'It was time to come home.' He is now facing a charge of custodial interference, the same charge his wife is due to face in court next month. Kelley's case dates back to December 2004 when Mark Nunes, a physician, was granted custody of daughter Mary, then eight, to take her for treatment for an unspecified illness. However, Genevieve, also a physician, refused to hand the girl over, instead taking her to Colorado for a second opinion, where a doctor diagnosed her with acute post traumatic stress disorder. While in Colorado, Genevieve alleged that Mr Nunes had sexually abused the girl, and then fled to South America along with current husband Scott. The state Division of Children, Youth and Families investigated and said any claims of abuse were 'unfounded,' and instead concluded that Genevieve instead likely abused the girl. Charges were never brought, however, because by that point the Kelleys, along with Mary Nunes, had already vanished. Mary Nunes, disappeared when she was aged 8 (left), and is now aged 19 (digitally aged version, right). The Kelleys fled after Mark Nunes, Mary's biological father, was granted custody of his daughter in 2004. Genevieve (pictured) refused to hand her daughter over to Mr Nunes, and took the girl first to Colorado, then boarded a flight to South America and was not seen again for a decade. Despite well-publicized searches of the U.S., Canada, and South America, and dozens of other appeals, there was no sign of the family until February last year. Shortly after Mary turned 18, and was therefore no longer subject to the family court, Genevieve made contact with the authorities, but refused to come forward. Then, on  Monday, November 13, she finally appeared, saying she needed medical treatment for a son she gave birth to with Scott while she was in hiding. But despite pressure from officials, and pleas from her former husband, she refused to reveal the location of Mary, or husband Scott, saying only that the girl was safe. Then, on Monday, officials were alerted that Scott and Mary had come forward after the pair went to the U.S. Department of State office in Costa Rica to get travel documents to return home. Deputy Marshal Jamie Berry, New Hampshire case manager for the Kelley case, said marshals were alerted to the family's travel arrangements, and stopped them as they landed. Genevieve, now aged 50, was arrested by authorities in November last year after she came forward asking for medical treatment for a son that she gave birth to while in hiding. Scott and Mary were taken into custody at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (pictured) on Monday. Mary is now living at an undisclosed location in the U.S., while Scott is in police custody. Mr Berry said: 'Investigators talked to her and made sure she was OK. We asked if she wanted any other arrangements, and she said no. We wanted to make sure she was there of her own free will. . 'It's been a long ten years. We had a lot of lookalikes we had investigated. We followed a lot of false leads, but we had to follow them all. Mary's safe, and that was the overall goal for us.' Mary has been released from custody and is now staying at an undisclosed location in the U.S., officials said. It was confirmed that she plans to testify at her mother's trial, which is due to begin next month. . Genevieve Kelley had previously argued that her daughter should be allowed to testify by video, but a judge turned this request down, saying she needed to be questioned by prosecutors. Scott Kelley was jailed in Atlanta and couldn't be reached for comment. If he doesn't agree to return to New Hampshire, Berry said, extraditions proceedings will begin. .",

    "document": "Irish betting company Paddy Power is backtracking after tweeting that \"Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male.\" The tweet, a pun on the name of the famous home end at Liverpool Football Club, alluded to recent controversial incidents in the United States in which unarmed African-American men have been killed by police. Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: \"It was a joke, and no offense was meant.\" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: \"We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real.\" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised \"money back if he walks\" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius. Monday's win put Liverpool fifth in the table, four points behind defending champion Manchester City, which holds England's final European Champions League qualification spot with six games left to play this season. Young England forward Raheem Sterling, who has turned down a new contract, scored a fine solo goal in the first half, and midfielder Joe Allen's 70th-minute strike condemned 13th-placed Newcastle to a fifth successive league defeat.

Paul Pogba (Juventus) £75m. Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton) £15m. Memphis Depay (PSV Eindhoven) £30m. Jackson Martinez (Porto) £25m .

Ahead of Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley, Rodgers indicated it could take two decades for Sheik Mansour’s club to reach the status of either Liverpool or Manchester United. City have been heavily linked with a £50million move for Sterling, who has two years left on his contract and is stalling on a new deal. The champions have also monitored vice-captain Jordan Henderson, who only has a season left on his Anfield contract. Brendan Rodgers says that a move to Manchester City would not be step up for Raheem Sterling. Rodgers talks to Sterling during Friday's training session ahead of FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa. However, Rodgers was emphatic that moving to City would not represent a step up. ‘If you say that City is a bigger club than Liverpool, you’re wrong,’ he said. ‘I’ve got big respect for what City are doing — they’re trying to build it the right way. But at this moment you can’t compare the size of the two clubs. ‘You’ve got Liverpool and United, the two biggest clubs in this country and the rest of them are fighting to be there over the next 20 years. I wouldn’t say we were a development ground for going to “bigger” clubs.’. City have tried to sign players from Arsenal and Liverpool hoping to weaken their rivals. They have bought Gael Clichy, Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Kolo Toure from Arsenal but failed to lure Fernando Torres when he was at Anfield. . Sterling is wanted by Manchester City this summer for £50million as he stalls over new contract. Sterling has been one of Liverpool's leading lights and was nominated for PFA Young Player of the Year. This summer, Liverpool will also try to sign James Milner from City. Rodgers hopes victory over Villa will strengthen his case and increase the chances of keeping players. ‘Our vision is to win trophies,’ he said. ‘The first objective was to get into the Champions League again. We arrived there this year and could focus on winning a trophy. We just have to concentrate on performance levels, get to the final and we’ll take it from there.’.

    "document": "Gary Player will attend his 58th Masters this week fully expecting to welcome a new member to the game’s most exclusive club and salute what he considers would be one of the sport’s finest accomplishments. The great man considers Tiger Woods completing the career Grand Slam at the age of just 24 as the best golfing feat he has seen. So you can imagine how excited he is at the prospect of Rory McIlroy becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors at only 25. ‘I’m not sure people fully realise what a magnificent effort it would be,’ said the South African legend. ‘When I completed my Slam at 29 I said to my wife that you will never see that done again. Then Jack Nicklaus came along and did it at 26 and then Tiger at 24. Jack Nicklaus watches his shot go for a birdie on the 17th at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta in 1986. Rory McIlroy meets up with South African Golf Legend Gary Player during the pro-am in 2009. Rory McIlroy, pictured in action at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and is favourite to win the Masters. ‘Now we have Rory, and I tell you this: I honestly believe he is going to do it. I just believe everything is going to fall into place for him, that he will learn from the mistakes he made when he messed up in 2011 and put everything right.’. It is not hard to see why Player would have such a special affinity for McIlroy. Two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the Americans in the majors in their own backyard; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism. Forget Tiger. It was Player, of course, who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness. Heavens, he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now, at the age of 79. He is withering in his contempt of those who say McIlroy is ‘bulking up’ too much in the gym. ‘I’m going to guess most of the critics are fat and don’t watch what they eat,’ he says. ‘Just because they’re lazy, they can’t grasp that fitness is so vital. Tom Watson presents Player with a Green Jacket after the 1978 Masters Tournament at Augusta National. ‘I was told that because I was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and I wouldn’t win any tournaments after the age of 34. I was told I had no chance of winning the US Open if I was squatting 325lb the previous evening. What rubbish. ‘I’m just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier. I used to go down to the local YMCA wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment. But it you want to be a superstar, and by a superstar I mean a player who has won at least six majors, there are no short cuts. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta . ‘Rory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the Masters. And yes, I can see a lot of similarities with myself. I love the fact he is a people person, for example, and engages with the fans. That’s what I used to love, and still do. So many pros can’t be bothered to talk to the fans and it’s so wrong.’ Player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career Grand Slam is a modern media invention. ‘I tell you it was electrifying when I completed it in 1965,’ he said. ‘I so wanted to follow Gene Sarazen and particularly Ben Hogan and become the third player to achieve it, because Hogan was the best player I’d seen. Jack and I were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice Jack gave me that helped me over the line. ‘I was due to play a tournament at Greensboro in 1965 when Jack said if I wanted to win the US Open and complete the set I should go with him to the US Open site and practise. I said I needed the money, that I had loads of children to look after, but I went with him. So he played a key role. McIlroy manages a smile after throwing away a four-shot lead on the final day of the Masters in 2011. Jack Nicklaus  waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the 2014 Masters golf tournament. ‘It was amazing afterwards. Everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing. How on earth could it happen?’. Player and Nicklaus have remained lifelong friends. They will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before Player heads to Greece for his 80th birthday celebrations. ‘There will be 35 people there and Jack and I will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it,’ said Player, laughing. As for Augusta, he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on Thursday alongside Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And then, 50 years on from his own date with history, he will join every other fascinated observer to see if another non-American can complete the set of majors and join him on what former US Open champion Curtis Strange evocatively refers to as golf’s Mount Rushmore.",

'We have to produce a great performance against one of the greatest teams in the history of Bayern,' Lopetegui, whose team are unbeaten in the competition this season, said.

Headteacher Linda Shute has banned children from consuming drinks - including tea, coffee, fruit juice and soft drinks - in a bid to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School in New Addington, south London. But some parents believe the water-only rule is too strict, claiming many children go all day without a drink because they do not like water. Scroll down for video . A headteacher is forcing primary school pupils to only drink water during the school day after banning all other drinks, including fruit juice. Samantha Moore, who launched the petition, said: 'As a mother, I have the right to choose what my son drinks.' Another campaigner, Anela, from Croydon, added: 'They should be able to drink whatever they want and not just water because some kids don't like water.' . Mrs Shute, who announced her aims by enforcing the rule in a school newsletter last month, said: 'The water-only policy is being very well supported by parents and children. 'Thank you for this and know in your hearts, if you have any doubts, this policy is for the long-term health of all your children.' But her move provoked a backlash from some, who branded it a 'joke'. Alan Fay said: 'It's about time that schools started looking after the kids again and stop just doing what is told by the powers above.' Gemma Irwin, from New Addington, added : 'I believe that it should be up to the parent what their child drinks. 'If teachers are allowed tea and coffee, why can't a child have a bottle of juice or flavoured water?' . But the school has defended its decision. The rule has been enforced to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School (pictured) in New Addington, south London. It follows a similar ban which sparked anger at Valence Primary School in Dagenham, east London, when it was introduced in January last year. Headteacher Elizabeth Chaplin brought in the new rule as part of a 'health drive' and drinks other than water were poured down the sink. In June last year, children at Carlton Central Infants' School in Nottingham, were barred from drinking fruit squash - a measure opposed by some parents. Tam Fry, chairman of the Child Growth Foundation and spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, is among campaigners who have pushed for healthy drink options in schools. He has praised schools that clamp down on sugar-filled juices, which he believes should be limited to one small glass a week. Mr Fry said: 'Fruit juice is known to be really laden with sugar, and it needs to be a treat - not an everyday occurrence. The preference in schools should be water, which is hugely beneficial.'  .",

    "document": "As he kept two young women locked up as sex slaves in his basement, Ariel Castro was looking for a wife, a new book about the Cleveland kidnapper has revealed. A 39-year-old woman named Lillian Roldan came forward to author John Glatt to say she dated Castro from 2000 to 2003, a three-year period during which Castro kidnapped and imprisoned Michelle Knight and Amanda Berry in his Ohio home. Roldan describes Castro in Glatt's book The Lost Girls as nothing short of a gentleman, who was 'completely normal' in the bedroom, and even romantic. Scroll down for video . Blinded by love: Lillian Roldan (left) says she dated Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro (right) from 2000 to 2003. She says she visited his house often and never knew about the young women he was keeping prisoner. However, she says he did keep his basement padlocked, which she found peculiar. When she asked about the need to lock the door, Castro allegedly told Roldan that he kept his money stored down there and 'didn't want his kids to steal it'. . In the book set to be published later this month, Roldan recalls meeting 16-years-older Castro on a blind date set up by friends in May 2000. He allegedly invited her to watch him play music one night and it was 'love at first sight'. Under her nose: During the three years she was with Castro, he would kidnap 21-year-old Michelle Knight and 17-year-old Amanda Berry. A few months after breaking up, he kidnapped his third victim Gina DeJuses. Roldan pictured above with another man in a picture posted to Facebook. Seemingly normal: Roldan detailed her 'romantic' relationship with Castro in the new book The Lost Girls by John Glatt . Roldan visited Castro at his house often, and sometimes ran into his ex-wife Grimilda Figueroa. Castro abused Figuero during their marriage, but he acted so kind around Roldan that she thought the beatings were just a rumor. As for their sex life, Roldan says Castro was 'completely normal' and 'considerate'. . She says at one point during their relationship, Castro popped the question but Roldan declined since she didn't believe in marriage. . After the proposal, Castro remained dedicated to Roldan and even bought her a ruby ring. After buying the flashy piece of jewelry, Castro took Roldan along to one of his music gigs where he had yet another romantic gesture in store. . Free women: Amanda Berry (left), Gina DeJesus (center) and Michelle Knight (right), were held captive in Castro's home for years. They found freedom in May 2013, when Berry's 6-year-old child helped the trio escape . Stolen youth: Castro kidnapped Michelle Knight (right) in 2002 when she was 21, eight months later he kidnapped then 17-year-old Amanda Berry (left). A year later, he captured 14-year-old Gina DeJesus (center) Mid-way through the performance, he took the microphone and told the audience: 'Today, I gave my girlfriend Lillian a ring.' . 'So everyone clapped,' Lillian recalls. 'And he told the group that he wanted to sing \"La Bamba\" for me. It was so romantic and I was charmed. It was such a special [night] and he really did show me love.' While Castro remained the normal man she called her boyfriend, two years into their relationship he started harboring a secret at home. . In August 2002, Castro kidnapped then 21-year-old Michelle Knight and locked her in his basement. Eight months later, he kidnapped another girl, 17-year-old Amanda Berry. Apparently distracted by the two young women that he was torturing at home, Castro abruptly cut ties with Roldan in October of that year, sending her a letter that said he 'didn't love her enough to stay.' . Prison: Above, Catro's Cleveland home where he kept the three women locked up for years . Five months after Roldan received the unexpected break-up letter, Castro's third victim, Gina DeJesus, went missing. She was 14 years old at the time. . For the next nine years the women were locked inside Castro's home and kept secret from the outside world. . The three women found freedom in May 2013, when Berry's 6-year-old daughter by Castro helped the trio to escape the house and alert police. Castro was arrested and sentenced to life in prison plus $1,000 years. About a month after his sentencing, Castro committed suicide in prison. .",

    "document": "Listeners say the  last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions on the iPlayer service. It seems that the BBC has lost the plot with its radio dramas. Frustrated listeners say the vital last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions uploaded to the iPlayer service. . They branded the problem ‘irritating’, ‘annoying’ and ‘frustrating’ and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. . Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system.  . But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. . It was raised by the BBC’s own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: ‘Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off? . 'All because you can’t be bothered to check that whole show was there. Please, if you are going to make available a programme I have missed can I have the whole programme?’. Another added: ‘I enjoy radio drama immensely but just recently I have found that some final episodes have last the vital few minutes. I was simply left hanging in the air at a very crucial stage.’. Shows such as Dad’s Army and Hancock’s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. According to the BBC’s own figures, in February this year, 57million ‘requests’ were made for radio programmes on BBC iPlayer. . Each request means a person chose to listen to a show. Of this number, one quarter were people listening to programmes on catch-up, a jump from one in five the previous month. As the use of catch-up becomes increasingly popular, more people will suffer from shows missing their final moments. Andrew Scott, General Manager of the BBC’s Audience Facing Services, appeared on Feedback and apologised for the problem and said they are now adding two minutes to the end of all its recordings in an attempt to stamp out the problem. He told the programme: ‘There are a lot of shows every week that are made available on demand and we simply can’t humanly check every single one of those, so what we are trying to do is make sure we have the very best fail safe systems in place.’ .",

    "document": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Stan Freberg, whose freewheeling comic career in advertising garnered him worldwide acclaim and whose satirical entertainments abounded on TV, the radio and on records, has died. He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. \"He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,\" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a \"guerilla satirist.\" The New York Times dubbed him the \"Che Guevara of advertising,\" and years later, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. \"Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,\" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. \"RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend.\" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. \"Wun'erful Wun'erful,\" his 1957 spoof of \"champagne music\" — on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May — lampooned \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit \"Cry,\" which Freberg rendered as \"Try.\" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including \"St. George and the Dragonet,\" a 1953 send-up of the series \"Dragnet.\" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, \"That's Rich.\" Three years later, he presented \"The Stan Freberg Show\" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: \"Mad Men's\" return. He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for \"The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows.\" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy \"Time for Beany,\" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an \"office\" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show \"Toast of the Town.\" Hollywood Reporter: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" -- the untold story. Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as \"Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,\" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in \"Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was \"More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,\" and he even had a corporate motto: \"Ars Gratia Pecuniae\" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon \"What's Brewin', Bruin,\" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's \"Three Little Bops.\" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's \"Lady and the Tramp\" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, \"Back in Action\" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear. Survivors also include his wife, Hunter, and a granddaughter. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.",

    "document": "The Fulham fans in the Jimmy Steed Stand applauded their team at the final whistle. It was not the victory manager Kit Symons had called for but a point away to Charlton probably secures their future in the Championship next season. They are eight points clear of Millwall and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the Premier League last season is alarming. A vertiginous decline, just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4-1 trouncing by bitter rivals Brentford last week, Symons was looking for a quick response from his players. . Johann Gudmundsson celebrates his first-half effort as Charlton come from behind to earn a point. The Icelandic winger is joined by his Charlton teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at The Valley. He got it with Ross McCormack giving them the lead after eight minutes. A superb long ball by Michael Turner found Matt Smith who headed on to the Scotsman to loop the ball over the top of Charlton goalkeeper Stephen Henderson in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the Jimmy Seed stand. The passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling Charlton fans harbour towards Scott Parker. The midfielder, who missed the Brentford game through illness, departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos. Not that it seemed to affect him as he dictated the pace of the game in the early stages, feeding striker Smith well. Ross McCormack headed over a stranded Stephen Henderson with just eight minutes played in London . McCormack celebrates his goal in front of the traveling Fulham fans with just eight minutes played. Charlton Athletic: Henderson, Gomez, Ben Haim, Johnson, Fox, Johann Gudmundsson, Cousins, Diarra, Bulot (Eagles 70) Vetokele (Church 79) Watt. Subs: Bikey Amougou, Wiggins, Lennon, Dmitrovic, Lepoint. Fulham: Bettinelli, Hoogland, Burn, Turner, Husband, Parker, Tunnicliffe, Guthrie,(Kacaniklic 68), Kavanagh (Ruiz 68), Smith, McCormack . Subs: Kiraly, Stafylidis, Woodrow, Rodallega, Donnelly. But Charlton hit back with a 16th minute equaliser. Morgan Fox’s cross bounced across the front of goal and Frederic Bulot swung a leg at it but could not connect. . It was left for a waiting Johann Gudmundsson to fire his 10th goal of the season into the top right corner. Goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, who seemed rooted to the spot, wisely dragged a furious James Husband, who seemed to believe the goal offside, from a confrontation with the linesman. Almost the whole stadium thought Gudmundsson had nabbed his second when Igor Vetokele set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss, hitting the side netting instead. The second half was low in quality but high in chances. The visitors seemed reenergised after the interval, forcing a save in the 46th minute. Matt Smith found space in the centre of the box and got his head on a pinpoint James Husband cross but Henderson did well to thwart the effort. Charlton soon asserted control with Tony Watt going close three times before Parker was booked for bringing him down with a late challenge. The Charlton players were outraged when referee Andy Madley awarded Fulham a free kick 25 yards out deep into stoppage time but McCormack blasted the ball over the bar. Joseph Gomez  and Dan Burn fight for the ball during match between Charlton Athletic and Fulham. Fulham now sit 20th in the table eight points clear of fellow London rivals Millwall, but Symons is refusing to relax just yet. He said: ‘We’re definitely not safe until it’s mathematically sure because this league is topsy turvy at both ends and it is going to go to the wire. . 'But I can’t be greedy so I will take the point and I was pleased with the performance.’. Tony Watt skips past Danny Gutherie  during the Sky Bet Championship match  The Valley.",

    "document": "Starbucks is embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs after it was accused of using a little-known British company to avoid paying taxes across Europe. The U.S. coffee giant is being probed by the European Commission over some of the methods it used to lower its tax bills. It could face millions of pounds in back taxes if they are found to be illegal. For the first time yesterday, details emerged about the UK company at the heart of the probe, which is focusing on sweetheart tax deals between Starbucks and the Dutch government. Probe: Starbucks ran its European division - including the UK - through the Netherlands, but it paid just £1.9million in tax to the Dutch government, from a reported £300million profit. Starbucks ran its European business, including its booming UK division, through the Netherlands where it paid almost no tax on its profits. But it has now emerged that the coffee chain used a defunct British entity to hide potentially millions of pounds from the Dutch taxman. By registering its Intellectual Property – such as its brand and logo – in a UK company called Alki LP, it was able to pay hefty sums from its Netherlands division into Britain. Its Dutch division paid just £1.9million of tax, despite reporting profits of £300million – a meagre tax rate of less than 1per cent. A Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered previously unknown details about the UK entity, including a claim that it had not a single registered employee. Starbucks has already been called ‘immoral’ by MPs for its labyrinthine structure that effectively funnelled money out of the UK. Schemes used by the company include buying its coffee beans in Switzerland and selling them at a 20per cent mark-up to the Netherlands, where they are then roasted before being sold on again to Britain. This means that much of the money it makes from UK sales flows into jurisdictions that have lower or less stringent tax regimes. Revealed: It is now claimed the company, which has previously been in the spotlight for its tax practices, may have used a British company to put hefty sums from its Netherlands branch into the UK. Between 1998 and 2012 the company paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in Britain, despite racking up combined sales of more than £3billion here. But after its tactics were exposed, the company offered to pay a voluntary £20million in tax to avoid a public boycott. Now details of a little-known tax division have emerged. A UK-registered holding business called Alki LP was set up to house the branding of the business. In a bizarre move, Alki appeared to have no employees – and was registered at the offices of Starbuck’s tax lawyers Baker & McKenzie. Compliance: A Starbucks spokesman said the company complies 'with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines' But because of the very limited details available, it is impossible to identify how much money the arm received – or whether it paid any tax in the UK. Accounts for Starbucks’ Dutch businesses show that they paid several million pounds a year into the division. But without access to full corporate documents it is impossible to tell whether this remained in the UK division or was funnelled straight into another tax haven. The business, which was closed down last year, has never filed proper accounts at Companies House. When it was dissolved, Alki was folded into a new company, Starbucks EMEA Holdings – though this business has also yet to file any accounts. This is an aspect that EU investigators believe is key to their probe. Earlier this year the British boss of Starbucks provoked outrage after suggesting the company would not pay ‘normal’ levels of tax for years. UK managing director Mark Fox said the company needed to get ‘its mojo back’ before it would begin to turn a profit. But he was confounded only weeks later when Starbucks reported its first ever UK profit of £1.1million – despite sales being a bumper £300million. On this it paid taxes of just £232,363, as well as the sum of £11.2million as part of its voluntary £20million tax payment. A Starbucks spokesman said: ‘We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines and we continue to cooperate with the European Commission’s state aid investigation in the Netherlands.’ .  .",

The Belgium striker was signed by Liverpool in a £10million deal after impressing at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, before being loaned back to Lille for the 2014-15 season. But Origi has been following Liverpool's progress from across the English Channel and after seeing the rise of Ibe and Raheem Sterling, is eagerly anticipating working under Brendan Rodgers. Divock Origi said the progress of Liverpool's youngsters have heightened his excitement at joining the club . Origi referenced the progress of winger Jordon Ibe (left) as an example of youth players improving at the club. Origi added that he thinks the long-term progress of Raheem Sterling means he is joining the right club. 'When you see how the coach and the staff work with the young players - how Sterling, for example, has learned over the years and how Ibe is now integrating with the team, it is very interesting,' Origi told Liverpool's official website. 'It is very nice to have seen that this season. 'The manager is one of the reasons I came to Liverpool - he's someone who has proven he knows how to work with young players, knows how to develop young players and also lets them play.' Origi, who has scored seven times in Ligue 1 this season, believes that the backing of Liverpool's supporters will help him elevate his game. 'I'm somebody who when I feel loved, when I feel appreciated by the supporters, then I can give even more. It gives you a boost on the field. In Belgium it was this way, and I can see it at Liverpool.' Origi (second eight) earned a transfer to Liverpool after impressing for Belgium at the 2014 World Cup. Origi added that the challenges he has faced at Lille this season will make him a better player for Liverpool. Origi admits it has been a challenging season at Lille attempting balance the demands of the league with the Europa League but believes the experience he has gained means he will arrive at Liverpool a better player than this time last year. 'In a mental aspect, I've learnt a lot and I've learnt a lot about football and people looking at you,' Origi said. 'It's made me stronger and that's essential for me before coming to Liverpool.'",

    "document": "An unknown man's theft of a Texas neighborhood's wild peacock was caught on camera by surveillance video as he roughly handled the beautiful bird. Residents of Beckley Club Estates in Dallas, Texas, say that they saw a man approach a male peacock, who was in the middle of its mating ritual and had unfurled its full plumage, before quickly snatching him up on Saturday. Footage from the home of Lisa Solis shows the thief grab the animal by both its claws before shoving him in his black SUV around 7pm. Residents of a Dallas neighborhood saw a man approach a male peacock, who was in the middle of its mating ritual and had unfurled its full plumage, before quickly snatching him up on Saturday. The man is seen bending down and picking up the bird by its claws before shoving it into his black Chevy Tahoe with its feathers sticking out of the door. Solis's neighbor Tisha Crear said she saw the event, and rushed out of the house and yelled at the man, but could only watch as he drove off with half of the peacock's feathers hanging out of the door. Ms Crear said that she had heard peahens screaming before the incident when the bird, the largest and oldest male peacock of those that live in the subdivision, was stolen, according to NBC Dallas. Ms Solid called the theft and aggressive treatment of the bird animal cruelty. . 'Do I need to sit on the porch with a shotgun or what do I have to do? Because we are going to protect the peacocks,' Ms Crear said, holding a feather from the stolen bird. Residents of the neighborhood, where peacocks have lived for the past 20 years, filed a report to the police about the missing animal. Surveillance video also shows the black Chevy Tahoe driver stalking the birds for 20 minutes before he grabbed his target. The suspect is described as a Hispanic man who was wearing shorts, a white shirt and a baseball cap. . Peacocks have lived in the neighborhood for 20 years, according to the Dallas Morning News. Residents, who have reported the incident to police, are also worried about the birds' long term survival if the peacock patriarch is not able to return and fertilize eggs. Neighbors have previously organized to protect the animals following one resident's complaint. .",

    "document": "The bumper crop of fruit and veg grown by the dedicated allotment gardeners each year was the talk of the town, and garnered prize after prize each year. The haul of produce was even enough to keep some growers self-sufficient. But now the gardeners are at war with their council after they were moved to new allotments so their old prize-winning plots can be bulldozed to make way for a car park and five-a-side football pitches. Scroll down for video . Living the Good Life: Michael Fyson, 77, has grown his own fruit and veg for more than 10 years. But the Broadway Allotment Association member says soil at the group's new site is 'dreadful' Thriving: The association's allotments were moved by Oldham council. The old prize-winning site (pictured) has been bulldozed to make way for a car park and football pitches. Pay out: But gardeners have complained about their new site, saying it has bad drainage and poor soil. The association has called on the council to pay growers compensation for the problems they've experienced. Many are complaining that the soil in their new allotments is so poor they cannot grow a bean - and that the new plots' drainage is so bad that their seedlings are rotting in the ground. They are demanding that Oldham council pays out compensation for the problems - which have seriously curtailed their growing season. Michael Fyson, 77, has grown his own fruit and veg for more than 10 years and he and his wife, Margaret, 78, live the Good Life as they are largely self-sufficient. He said: ‘The soil is dreadful and the land is flooded. It is impossible to grow there so the allotments are not fit for purpose and need plenty of work. ‘I still have potatoes, leeks, parsnips, cabbage, broccoli, strawberries, raspberries and gooseberries in storage from last year’s crop but this year I’ ll be lucky to grow anything. 'Dreadful': Gardeners say the soil at their new site (pictured) is so poor they can't grow a bean. Oldham council moved the group from their old allotments, which had been popular with residents since the 1930s. The drainage (pictured left) is also so bad that the seedlings of allotment holders are rotting in the ground. They are demanding the council pays out compensation for the problems at the plots in Failsworth, Oldham. ‘My wife and I totally depend on the crop from my allotment each year as we have three freezers to store it and it keeps us going all year.’. Mr Fyson, who has two grandchildren and one great grandson, has won award after award at the annual competition for Best Allotment in Oldham. He said: ‘I’ve done quite well over the year. But this year is going to be dreadful. I’ve been digging some trenches to drain the land and have had to bail out with a bucket. We won’t be able to grow anything of any quality here for quite a while.’. Green as you like: Council chiefs moved the Broadway Allotment Association to land a few hundred yards away from their original prize-winning site (pictured) as part of a plan to redevelop the nearby Lancaster Club. The development will include 144 homes, with the Grade II-listed club turned into apartments and a five-a-side football pitch and car park built on the former allotments where growers (pictured) used to plant their seedlings. Much-loved: One allotment holder, Michael Fyson, 77, has grown fruit and vegetables at the old site (pictured) for more than ten years. He has won award after award at the annual competition for Best Allotment in Oldham. The plots managed by the Broadway Allotment Association in Failsworth, Oldham have been popular with residents since the 1930s and kept many fed during the Second World War. However growers have been moved to land a few hundred yards away as part of a plan to redevelop the nearby Lancaster Club off Broadway into a ‘garden suburb’. The development will include 144 homes, with the Grade II-listed club turned into apartments and a five-a-side football pitch and car park will be built on the former allotments. Oldham council developed the new site and constructed greenhouses and sheds for the growers in recompense for losing their original plots. Ian Wade, 55, association secretary, said: ‘I understand the need to redevelop the area and it would be okay if they had given us a plot that worked. ‘But the soil they have put down is ridiculous. It has powdered brick, rubble, sand and stones in it and it is impossible to grow anything in it. ‘Gardeners can work to improve the soil but it is so shocking nothing will grow for years. The site is also flooded and seems impossible to drain.’. Now, the 17 tenants are calling on the council to give them compensation for the delay they will face in growing their produce and the extra work in making the land fit. Unhappy: Secretary of the the Broadway Allotment Association, Ian Wade (pictured), said the soil which had been put down at the new site was 'ridiculous'. He believes nothing will grow there for years. Oldham council said relocation of the allotments to the new site was not due to be completed until May but growers say this will limit their growing season. The 17 tenants are calling on the council to give compensation. Oldham council’s Elaine McLean said: ‘We are carrying out soil testing in the coming days to establish the cause of the standing water and how we can improve the situation for the plot holders.’.

    "document": "In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is pulled out of obscurity, swiftly develops expert bow-and-arrow skills and leads a government rebellion - all without having to deal with braces or a single spot. However, the rise of the young adult heroine has prompted a backlash on Twitter, as more people compare the fictional portrayals with the mediocrity of their own lives. Teenagers have taken to the social media site to hilariously voice their frustrations between the fantastical lives in the pages of books and in films, and reality using the hashtag #realisticYA. The Hunger Games book (left), the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence in the film - pictured right) deals with exciting scenarios but never from any teenage ailments such as acne or braces. Twitter user, Adrienne Long, makes a reference to the fact that many YA heroines have their lives turned upside-down, but they are always prepared. Real life would perhaps be very different. Many of the tweets look at similar dystopian situations to those in the novels, but the Twitter users describe their own realistic reactions, or what would really be probable. Comparing real life to Katniss Everdeen's role in The Hunger Games, Adrienne Long tweets: 'Girl finds out she has impossible destiny to fulfill. Fails miserably having never spent a day preparing for it #realisticYA.' Some funny tweets simply address that at a time when many teenagers are going through the awkward stages of puberty, the YA protagonists are completely free from any awkward ailments. Joanna Macgregor tweeted: 'I met this new guy at school. He's really freaking cute but he has, like, zits, and I have, y'know, a muffin-top.' . Young adults tell it like is is on Twitter under the hashtag #realistic YA. One teen addresses that unlike her perfect YA contemporaries, she suffers from  adolescent ailments. Another girl's tweet refers to Twilight, where the main character has to choose from multiple love-interests. Some look at dangerous scenarios and what would be likely to happen. . Rather than escaping every situation unscathed, the Twitter users take a wry and straight-forward approach to the situation. . Referring to the Twilight novel, one writer refers to Bella's choice between her multiple love-interests Jacob and Edward. . Danielle Welling writes: 'Girl has no problem choosing between two equally hot boys in love with her. Because no hot boys love her. #realisticYA.'  . Other tweets look at young teens in a realistic manner, calling them '100% human' rather than 'mysterious and broody', and others look at realistic situations that arise with teen romances. Another tweet describes being too busy to be the 'chosen one' - referring to the character Beatrice Prior in Divergent. Preeti Chhibber writes: 'Girl is Chosen One but actually has 250hrs of community service, college apps, SATs and resume building so she can't but thx #realisticYA.'   . Not the chosen one? In the book Divergent (left), Beatrice Prior, who is played by Shailene Woodley in the film (pictured right with actor Theo James) is the 'chosen' one and leads a rebellion against the corrupt goverment. One user points out that many would not have the time to simply drop their lives to become the 'Chosen One' The hashtag on Twitter sees users comparing the reality of their own lives to young adult heroines . This #realisticYA looks at the fact that real teenage scenarios can mean that sometimes love is unrequited. If Harry Potter had never gone to Hogwarts, JK Rowling may have had five or six less books to write. Some of the tweets are hilarious because if the character in question did what the tweet suggests, much of the action in the novels would have never happened. Linda Newbery tweets: 'Boy thinks about running away, but changes mind when he realises that life at home is just too comfortable.'  . Many can imagine what the Harry Potter books would have been like if Harry never went to wizard school, Hogwarts. . How young adults would really react to situations in novels revealed on Twitter. Another Twitter user users the hashtag to voice her concern that romantic leads have to be 'broody' or a 'jerk' Another girl writes about the realistic possibility that teenagers might be too frightened to confront their romantic interests. Hundreds of Twitter users have taken part in the hashtag. Others have written funny commentaries about how swiftly the heroine's life changes - and how a normal teenager, put in the same scenario, would be highly unprepared and may miss the opportunity. Another tweet explores the fact that on several occasions in YA novels, the protagonist may meet a mysterious, handsome stranger who aids her, but unlike normal teens is never overwhelmed or nervous. . Lustybustyliz writes: 'Girl meets boy at the library. He's smart, cute & interested. She has a panic attack and hides in the bathroom.'",

Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the Barclays Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to reshape their squad after a disappointing season. But Toure will fight for his City career this summer despite the club pondering his future. . Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make him available this summer. Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the  Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian. He is said to be content with life at the Etihad Stadium despite the difficulties and is in no rush to leave. The Ivorian has played a major role during City's recent trophy-laden period, helping the club to two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and League Cup since joining from Barcelona in 2010. And the powerhouse midfielder still believes he can have a major impact for City in the future and remains fully committed to the cause. Another stumbling block towards a potential move is the four-time African Player of the Year winner's wages. . Inter Milan, managed by Roberto Mancini, are interested but given his huge wages there are some doubts. Toure has more than two years left on his current £220,000-a-week deal and is unlikely to move for anything less. A number of clubs, such as Inter Milan, are interested in the 31-year-old, but given his huge salary there must be doubts over whether they would be able to afford it. Inter are prepared to offer Toure a five-year deal to compensate for the pay-cut he would be required to take if he moved to Italy — although, it remains to be seen whether he'd agree to such a compromise. There have been preliminary talks about a contract extension for Toure at City — which included the possibility of an ambassadorial role when he hangs up his boots. But it seems the club are now happy for him to leave. . City, meanwhile, will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao, currently on loan at Manchester United. City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo this summer. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a clause involving a permanent move to the Mestalla. Reports in Spain  suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a £20.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday’s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer but reports in Spain say they are looking at Radamel Falcao. Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has, however, not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao, who is set to leave United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim and offloading Negredo is seen as one way of affording the Colombia star. City had scouts at Porto, watching their 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, with the home team’s Brazilian left-back Alex Sandro said to be the main focus of interest.

    "document": "Half of hospitals in England are allowing patients to jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, new figures reveal (file picture) Half of hospitals are letting patients jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, an investigation has revealed. Some are charging up to a ‘shameful’ £2,700 for one eye – treble what it costs the health service – raising suspicions that they are ripping off elderly patients. Cataract treatment is being rationed in England to save money, even though the NHS recently announced it would fund weight-loss surgery for 15,000 obese adults every year at a cost of £6,000 each. . Yesterday the Mail revealed how millions was being wasted on prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Many NHS trusts have imposed arbitrary rules to determine who is eligible for cataract treatment, and patients who cannot read, sew or watch television are routinely turned away. . Those patients who do meet the strict criteria often have to wait eight months for treatment, over which time their eyesight deteriorates further and impairs basic tasks and hobbies. Freedom of Information responses from 78 hospital trusts in England obtained by the Mail found that 41 offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery themselves. The operation usually costs the NHS between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700. Campaigners accused hospitals of profiting from elderly patients. Clara Eaglen, from the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: ‘It’s shameful that people are being asked to consider funding their own treatment when they are entitled to it for free, and in a timely manner, on the NHS. Scroll down for video . ‘We strongly believe that everyone who has a sight-threatening condition deserves early access to treatments.’. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘In the last few years it has become harder to access cataract surgery as people are forced to wait for their sight to significantly deteriorate before getting help. ‘It is extremely worrying if people whose sight is starting to fail feel the only way to get help quickly is to pay for it. ‘Cataracts are extremely debilitating and treatment should be based on a clinical need not age or bank balance.’. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, added: ‘The NHS belongs to the people, and all patients have the right to access appropriate treatment at the right time and in the right setting, irrespective of their ability to pay; we cannot and should not have a two-tier NHS.’. In England, 41 hospital trusts said they offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery. The operation costs the NHS about between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700. More than half of over-65s suffer from cataracts, which are cloudy patches in the lens that make vision blurred or misty. Sight can be restored in a simple 45-minute operation, with doctors using ultrasound waves to break up the cataract. . Most hospitals charge patients between £700 and £1,000 per eye for cataract treatment and say the money is spent on improving services. But this rises to £2,552 at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey and £2,700 at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust in Kent. Several trusts actively encourage patients to ‘self-fund’. The University Hospital Southampton’s website informs patients that ‘surgery will be offered much sooner than the usual NHS wait’. It adds: ‘Our cataract choice service offers a new option, between the traditional private sector and the NHS, bringing private healthcare within the reach of many more people.’. Yeovil District Hospital in Somerset says its private cataract service will ‘help you get back to the things you love’. Patients at North Cumbria are offered free parking and a daily newspaper, while at Frimley Park they can choose from an ‘exclusive a la carte menu’, which includes whitebait and chicken goujons.",

    "document": "A federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, a convicted felon, with unlawful possession of a firearm. In this week's indictment,  Durst, 71, is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver, which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge, according to the indictment. The charge is the latest in a litany of accusations. A Louisiana judge ruled last month that Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail at a facility near New Orleans. Durst was featured this spring in \"The Jinx,\" a HBO documentary about him. He's accused of killing his friend  Susan Berman at her home in California in 2000. He also faces state weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans. Last month, court documents claimed that Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash. He also had a UPS tracking number. The package was intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said, and it contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. But the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last month. He awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of \"lying in wait\" and killing Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she \"was a witness to a crime.\" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. It's not the first time he has been accused of murder. He admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. DeGuerin has said Durst has serious medical conditions. He is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said. \"At the same time he was in the hospital, he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,\" DeGuerin said. DeGuerin also said that Durst is \"mildly autistic\" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism.",

    "document": "Bayern Munich cruised to a 6-1 victory against Champion's League rivals Porto last night. . But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto. The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' . Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? . Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. . Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend. And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight. The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit. King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy. The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. . Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. . 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip…from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' . High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013. A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one.  . 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' . Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. . Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. . Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. . What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. . 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! . 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.  .",

Now that Murray's life-affirming tale has now gone viral, he says 'It just shows you how such a pure act of kindness from one person can just spread through everyone and help make everyone’s day a little brighter.' Good Samaritan: A friendly stranger left this unbelievably friendly letter to Alberta law student Derek Murray in order to help him get his car started after he left the headlights on all day. At first, though, he assumed the letter was from an angry fellow motorist, he told the National Post. . 'When I first saw the note, I was expecting it to be an angry letter from someone telling me not to park there. Instead, I got someone just totally brightening my day. My day could have been ruined but, because of this guy, it was the highlight of my day.' The note reads, in part:. I noticed you left your lights on. The battery will probably not have enough charge to start your vehicle. I left a blue extension cord on the fence and a battery charger beside the fence in the cardboard box. If you know how to hook it up, use it to start your car. What followed was a detailed explanation of how to use the equipment. 'Sure enough,' Derek recalled to the National Post, 'I looked over at the house my car was parked beside, and there was a blue extension cord plugged into an outlet behind the guy’s house with a battery charger right there beside it.' Derek was able to get his car started, but when he rang the good Samaritan's doorbell, there was no answer. So, Derek left his own note as a thank you for the kind gesture. . He later snapped a photo of the stranger's friendly note to post to Facebook, where it has now gone viral. The note has been viewed millions of times and even Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson retweeted the photo.

    "document": "The leader of Kazakhstan has apologised after winning the presidential election with 97 per cent of the vote saying it would have been 'undemocratic' for him to make his victory more modest. Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 74-year-old former steel worker who has ruled the oil-producing nation since 1989, has won another five year term. Kazakh television showed a triumphant Nazarbayev walking on a red carpet, smiling and shaking hands and greeting thousands of jubilant supporters at a forum in the capital Astana. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been re-elected as president of Kazakhstan after winning 97 per cent of the vote. But international monitors have voiced their concern about the poll saying there was not a genuine choice of other candidates with most of his vocal opponents either being jailed or fled abroad. However, at a news conference, Nazarbayev said: 'I apologise that for super-democratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. 'If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?' The election was called more than a year before Nazarbayev's term was due to end, averting the risk that another year of economic pain could develop into a more serious challenge to his leadership. It also puts the question of a possible successor, an important issue for investors, off the table for now. Kazakhstan has been criticised by the West and human rights bodies for crackdowns on dissent. No election held there has yet been given a clean bill of health by monitors. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping promptly congratulated Nazarbayev on his re-election. Nazarbayev told a news conference after his victory that if he had interfered in the vote, it would have been undemocratic . Meanwhile Nazarbayev has promoted market reforms in the country and attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment, turning his nation of 17 million into the second-largest economy in the former Soviet Union and number two post-Soviet oil producer after Russia. The multi-ethnic, mainly Muslim country is stable in a region troubled by ethnic violence from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan. Nazarbayev has promoted 'a multi-vector policy', building good ties with neighbouring Russia and China as well as the United States and the European Union. But the economy has been hurt in the past year by the decline in global energy prices and by economic difficulty in neighbouring Russia, hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine. Kazakh economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.5 percent this year from a 4.3 percent rise in 2014. Gross domestic product may actually shrink if oil prices drop to below $50 per barrel, Kazakh officials have said.  .",

    "document": "It was another momentous night in Barcelona's proud European history, Neymar and Luis Suarez rampaging through Paris Saint-Germain's defence to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals. Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992. Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie. Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta. However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. . Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp. Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. . Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. . They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. . Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000. Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. . They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. . The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. . Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal. Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009. Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. . Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. . Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United. Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. . With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. . Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. . Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. . Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011. Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. . Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United. Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. . Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. . Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. . The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar. Messi converts from the penalty spot in Barcelona's 2-0 win at Manchester City last season. 22 goals - AC Milan. 18 - Celtic, Chelsea. 17 - Manchester United, Bayer Leverkusen, Arsenal. 16 - Panathinaikos, Lyon. 14 - Galatasaray. 13 - Shakhtar Donetsk, Spartak Moscow, Paris Saint-Germain. 10 - Ajax, Stutgart. 9 - Porto, BATE Borisov. 8 - Sporting Lisbon, Werder Bremen, Newcastle United . 75 - Lionel Messi. 22 - Rivaldo. 20 - Patrick Kluivert. 19 - Luis Enrique. 16 - Samuel Eto'o. 15 - Pedro. 14 - Ronaldinho. 11 - Javier Saviola, Xavi. 10 - Andres Iniesta. 8 - Neymar, Thierry Henry, Hristo Stoichkov, David Villa. 7 - Luis Figo, Gerard Pique, own goals.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .",

    "document": "The scene in the Old Government House Hotel could not be further removed from the horrors of war. There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served, a clink of cutlery on crockery, the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups. Somewhere outside, the clouds part and light floods the lounge. I reach for another scone, ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream, and marvel that, in this context, 70 years seems an eternity. Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey's only five-star hotel – pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port – would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere. Seventy years on: St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945), this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters. Invading officers would have stalked its corridors. By April 1945, they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin, and the Channel Islands – bypassed by the D-Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation. That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month – and with gusto. The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival (3 April–11 May) is a five-week hurrah of history, parades, concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago – Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, Herm and Sark. This is no small feat. Fiercely individual, the islands have never before combined to stage a big event. But here they have common cause. Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey's capital St Helier into swirls of people and music. It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey's harrowing half-decade. The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline – the swarthy, sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north. Intrigued, I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower, on the south-west shore. It is an oddly unnerving experience, the pillar-box slots in the bastion's sides eyeing me quietly. When I face the water, I almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine-gun barrel on my neck. Coastal curves: Guernsey's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of Portelet Bay. You can go further into Guernsey's wartime heritage. What appears to be a car park behind La Colinette Hotel on the western outskirts of St Peter Port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the Channel Islands. Hidden down a damp flight of stairs, the former German Naval Signals Headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there. This, of course, was the point. Its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter, semaphore murmur and serious conversation. German signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls. The bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival – its secrets brought into the light. The German Occupation Museum at Les Houards offers further perspective, flitting from frivolity to fear – on one hand the photo album of Freda Oliver, a local girl who dated (and married) a German officer; on the other, exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island's Jewish population, and copies of the Guernsey Evening Press turned to propaganda sheet. The darkness of life under Nazi rule is most obvious at the German Military Underground Hospital, at La Vassalerie. This enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave-labour sweat of prisoners of war – plenty of whom died in the process. As did many of the injured German troops brought here from France after the D-Day landings. With its dank passages and horror-film ambience, the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building. An island guardian: Mont Orgueil Castle has protected the east coast of Jersey since the 13th century. The picture is replicated 27 miles to the south-east. Jersey is a short hop from Guernsey – around an hour by fast ferry, less by air. Here, the Jersey War Tunnels – another military-medical complex – have been restored into something less frightening, with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels. The side-effects of occupation can be seen here – the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies. But so can the joy that liberation brought. Glorious video footage shows euphoria in St Helier as the news of German surrender broke; the Union Jack being hoisted at the Pomme D'Or Hotel. The hotel came to symbolise the Channel Islands' moment of deliverance. In a way, it still does, peering across what is now called Liberation Square, where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag – laughing, as if they are flying a kite. Other echoes resound across St Helier. The Jersey Museum and Art Gallery has a catalogue of copies of the Jersey Evening Post dating back 125 years, its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail (albeit through a fog of strict German control). The nearby Maritime Museum proffers the Occupation Tapestry Gallery – a montage of bright images, stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995, which depict Jersey brought to heel – armed troops in the streets, the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire. And the Jersey Archive is host to a remarkable resource – over 30,000 of the Occupation Registration Cards which were forced on islanders by the Nazi authorities. There are no smiles here – just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces. Bright days ahead: A view of the pretty coastal enclave of Gorey from the ramparts of Mont Orgueil Castle. The heaviness of the German bootprint is perhaps summed up by Battery Lothringen – a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite. This colossal bunker – which will also be accessible during the festival – 'protected' St Helier from the far side of St Aubin's Bay. The stairs into its depths seem to go down forever, to gun posts, control rooms and sleeping quarters – the decades peeling away as I walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy. And yet, just seven miles north-west, it all feels like a bad dream. St Brelade's Bay Hotel gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner. In the summer of 1940, it was another German outpost, requisitioned as a hang-out by Luftwaffe pilots. It is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted. Over breakfast, I peer out of the wide restaurant windows – at waves rolling gently up to the beach, and at St Brelade's, a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand. There is no stomp of marching boots this morning – but for five weeks, the Channel Islands are remembering a time when there was.

    "document": "I don't always talk about news events with my daughters, but there was something about the story of ESPN reporter Britt McHenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up. One of the main things I preach to my girls, ages 7 and 9, is the importance of respecting other people, no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish. It's something that my husband and I just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the President of the United States. Let me say right here that I have lost my cool from time to time, whether it's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant. In those cases, when I feel like I'm going to pop, I keep saying, \"This is unacceptable, This is unacceptable,\" and either hang up in disgust or storm off. (Not perfect ways of handling these incidents, but at no time would I ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations.) Some of McHenry's comments, such as how she's \"on television,\" imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she, by dint of her career, education and income, is better than people who don't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities. McHenry showed that she either forgot those \"golden rule\" lessons from childhood or that she hasn't really lived her life with that mantra. McHenry has since apologized on Twitter, saying she said \"some insulting and regrettable things,\" and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in Virginia,  she should \"always choose to be respectful and take the high road.\" But it's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker. \"I see this Britt McHenry video, and think: it's not just about how a celebrity shouldn't act in public, it's how all of us shouldn't act,\" wrote \"Cait\" on Twitter. Said \"Shannon,\" also on Twittter, \"I had no idea who Britt McHenry was before but ... now I know she's the kind of woman I hope I've taught my daughters not to be.\" \"Her language and disdain brings shame on her, her profession, and her employer. People don't all of sudden have such a vile tirade. This comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors. Let's let her be an example to others,\" wrote C Cooper on a Change.org petition asking McHenry's employers to fire her. The McHenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her. This morning, I told her McHenry was suspended for a week by ESPN, and that led to another conversation. My kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to \"treat other people the way you would want them to treat you\" even in uncomfortable moments. Celebrity apologies: The good, bad and uncomfortable. So, Britt McHenry, check out these examples of how the rich, famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity. After British journalist Katie Hopkins seriously fat-shamed pop music star Kelly Clarkson, saying a host of insulting things about the singer's weight, Clarkson won praise for her graceful response. \"That's because she doesn't know me. I'm awesome. It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think,\" she said. A college baseball player gets suspended for calling Little League baseball phenom Mo'ne Davis a \"slut.\" Her response? She emailed Bloomsburg University asking that the college reinstate him. \"Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance,\" Davis, the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in Little League World Series history, told ESPN. \"... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more.\" When an Argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to Pope Francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country's president ahead of the general election in October and possibly influencing the outcome, what did the Pope do? Well, he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call. Wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation! The pope appears to have been more than graceful, because after the conversation, the journalist pledged to learn how to pray. When Queen Bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip-synching the national anthem in honor of President Obama's inauguration in 2013, she didn't come out swinging. Instead, she admitted to singing along with her \"pre-recorded track\" at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring, a cappella rendition of the national anthem. Finally, Reese Witherspoon may be the closest example for McHenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode. When Witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence, the Academy Award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as, \"Do you know who I am?\" and \"You're about to find out who I am.\" She ultimately issued an apologetic statement, and then went on morning television to apologize some more. \"We went out to dinner in Atlanta, and we had one too many glasses of wine, and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not,\" she said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"It's completely unacceptable, and we are so sorry and embarrassed. We know better, and we shouldn't have done that.\" And, she added, \"When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure,\" she told the GMA host . Now, did McHenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry, you never berate them for their weight, job, appearance and income? Let's hope so. Can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect?

The French winger, 32, has won four Bundesliga titles as well as a Champions League during his time with the German giants, but it could have all been different had a proposed move to the Bernabeu in 2009 gone through. Real wanted Ribery after he fell out with then-Bayern head coach Louis van Gaal, though he says he was convinced to stay after being sold on his importance by the club's elite. Franck Ribery was convinced to reject Real Madrid after being sold on his importance to Bayern Munich. He was told that he could be as vital to Bayern as Lionel Messi is to Barcelona. Ribery fell out with then-head coach Louis van Gaal and says Real were willing to pay for him. 'I had intensive talks with Uli Hoeness, who was still president back then, and chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge,' Ribery told Goal. 'They told me I should not go, how the club needed me, how I was as important for Bayern as Lionel Messi was for Barcelona. 'Real tried, they wanted me. I don't know what price Bayern wanted them to pay. In the end I am happy how it ended.' As well as enjoying the collective success with Bayern, Ribery also picked up UEFA awards after his performances during the Champions League-winning campaign in 2012/13.

    "document": "Luke Rockhold staked his claim in New Jersey as the top middleweight contender in the UFC. Up next, Rockhold wants a title shot and a shot at MMA history in New York. Rockhold capped a brief and brilliant appearance in the cage with a rear naked choke at 2:32 of the second round and made Lyoto Machida tap to win a main event showdown between two of the top middleweights in UFC on Saturday night. Luke Rockhold beat Lyoto Machida by second-round submission in New Jersey. Rockhold celebrates his victory and now wants a shot at the middleweight title . 'I am the No 1 contender,' Rockhold said. 'I'm the best guy around.' Rockhold should be next in line for a pay-per-view title shot in the 185-pound division. With a dominant win over the 36-year-old Machida, he positioned himself to take on the winner of the UFC 187 fight next month between Chris Weidman and Vitor Belfort. Machida never put up much of a fight in his brief stint in the cage. Rockhold lost on his UFC debut in 2013, then rebounded with wins over Costas Philippou, Tim Boetsch, Michael Bisping. He won his third straight fight via submission and looked at his best at the Prudential Center. 'I did my part,' Rockhold said. 'Weidman, you're going to do your part. Let's take this across the way. Madison Square Garden, let's make history.' Rockhold was dominant from the first bell as he cruised to victory against Machida. Machida was marked up badly after the first round and didn't last long in the second session. MMA would have to become legalized in New York for that bout to happen. The Senate again approved a bill to legalize and regulate the combat sport that includes boxing, judo, wrestling and kickboxing. UFC remained hopeful that the assembly will finally approve the bill that would allow the promotion to stage a dream card in December at MSG. 'If it doesn't happen, it'll be crazy,' UFC President Dana White said. Jacare Souza, the No 1 ranked middleweight, made short work of Chris Camozzi in the co-main event. Souza won with an armbar submission at 2:33 of the first round. Jacare Souza (right) grapples with Chris Camozzi on his way to victory in the first round. Souza needed less than five minutes to earn victory and also wants a middleweight title shot. Souza, who lost to Rockhold in his Strikeforce days, hoped he could earn a shot at Weidman's title with a fight against Olympic silver medalist Yoel Romero. But when Romero was injured, Camozzi stepped in on short notice - and a shorter fight. Souza won his eighth straight UFC fight and hoped a month ago a win would mean his name would get called next for a middleweight title fight. Machida-Rockhold and Souza-Romero would have been a Final Four showcase of the best of the UFC middleweight contenders. But Romero's last-minute scratch meant Souza likely has a longer wait for the biggest fight of his UFC career. 'I want to get the shot at the title next,' Souza said. 'It's my time. I'm coming off five victories.' .  .",

Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond.

Nicky Clark celebrates after putting Rangers 1-0 up against Raith Rovers on Sunday. Clark in the air as he heads the ball towards goal to give the hosts the lead at Ibrox. Rangers manager Stuart McCall applauds the home fans after the full-time whistle. The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference. Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert. But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes. Vuckic cut inside from the right before unleashing a powerful drive into the bottom corner to claim his seventh Rangers goal.

The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart. Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards. Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go.

    "document": "Mad Men star Jon Hamm's secret college bullying shame has been exposed by court documents unearthed from the actor's time at the University of Texas at Austin. According to shocking arrest warrants and summons seen by Star magazine, the 44-year-old Golden Globe winner allegedly set fire to one pledge after viciously beating him and using a claw hammer to drag him by his genitals during a hazing ritual gone wrong. The documents claim that Hamm, 44, was eventually charged with assault in connection with the sadistic November 1990 initiation, but he managed to get the charges dismissed before he began his ascent to superstardom. Scroll down for video . College student: Jon Hamm is pictured here in the University of Texas at Austin yearbook for 1990 (left) - the same year he was allegedly involved in a hazing scandal at the Sigma Nu fraternity. The actor is pictured (right) this week. According to the explosive court documents, Hamm was in his sophomore year at UT-Austin when a prospective 21-year-old pledge was called to the Sigma Nu house at 2.30am. When he got there, according to Travis County Court documents, Hamm - who was then aged 20 - and other frat brothers ominously told him, 'It's going to be a long night!' The unidentified junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity. The alleged victim told police that Hamm and other members hit him with a paddle 30 times and then lifted the pledge off the floor by his underwear, 'pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion', causing 'great pain'. The pledged then claimed that Hamm led him to a basement 'Pit' where he slammed the junior's face into the ground while he was doing push-ups and then allegedly stood on his spine with his full weight. Shockingly, after this, Hamm is then supposed to have set fire to the pledge's pants and refused to let him pat the flames down, but instead made him blow them out. Shame: The allegedly assault saw Hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to a 21-year-old pledge and beat him with a paddle. At the end of the vicious hazing ritual, the pledge was taken to a part of the frat house called the 'Party Room' where Hamm 'hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his genitals and led him by the hammer around the room'. Allegedly not content with this, Hamm then went onto to break into another potential pledge's room that night and subjected him to a similar torturous initiation. However, the morning after, the mother of the first pledge was called to his room to find him 'hiding in a closet at his apartment, his buttocks and legs black with brusises.' Despit pleading with his mother not to go public, saying 'They'll come kill me!', she reported the incident to the police. High school senior: These pictures of Jon Hamm are from 1989, the year he graduated from John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri and one year before his admission to University of Texas at Austin. Early career:  Jon Hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show The Big Date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident . Huge hit: Man Men and the character of Don Draper has given Jon Hamm his biggest role to date - winning a Golden Globe for his work on the AMC series. Eight warrants were issued for Hamm and seven other frat members, which was shut down for a time after the alleged incident. Three members of Sigma Nu were sentenced to 30 days in prison for the hazing ritual and Hamm was eventually hit with hazing and assault charges in 1991. In the wake of the hazing incident, the Sigma Nu fraternity was shut down in 1990 after the pledge's mother made her son's alleged assault public by going to the police. . In 1990, the AP reported that Sigma NU would close and that seven students were being punished after pledges were 'physically and psychologically attacked'. The-then national president of Sigma Nu, James Cherry, said that he was revoking the charter of its UT-Austin, saying, 'Basically, we're out of business on this campus'. 'But our fraternity was founded in opposition to hazing in 1869 and we will not tolerate any form of hazing today.' A warrant was issued for Hamm's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed. He returned home to live with his family in Missouri and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30-day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career. A friend told Star that although shocking, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.' Hazing incident: Following the alleged assault of the 21-year-old pledge, the Sigma Nu fraternity at UT-Austin (pictured) was shut down . Recently, the Mad Men star has admitted that playing the complex role of Don Draper has taken its toll. In an interview he gave just weeks before he checked himself into rehab last month for 30 days, Hamm opened up about the effect that playing Madison Avenue ad man Don Draper had on his psyche. The 44-year-old star told Variety: 'Playing this guy does not come without its own difficulties, it’s not fun to live in this guy’s headspace year after year.' He added: 'People ask, \"What’s the difference between you and Don?\" Look, I drink, I get drunk. I’m not immune to that,. 'And (creator) Matt (Weiner) will tell you, the darkness in Don has not abated, it’s gotten worse year after year. It’s relentless. And it can be hard on you as a person. I love coming to work; I love the people I work with. But it’s been rough.' As he reflected on being offered similar roles and being typecast as the dark, brooding, alcoholic womanizing character, Jon revealed he wants to distance himself from that persona.",

The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James’s Palace, saying: ‘We are going to do something new this evening. ‘The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it’s her 25th birthday today.’. Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved. Andrew told her: ‘You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).’.

    "document": "Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League's Easter weekend fixtures and the race for promotion across the Football League. 1. Playing Jordan Henderson as a wing back instead of in his normal central midfield position was an idea that went spectacularly wrong for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. . The England star, who has taken over the captain’s armband in the absence of Steven Gerrard, gave the ball away 23 times in 90 minutes as he struggled to handle the role at Arsenal. . Jordan Henderson (left) toiled as a wing back in Liverpool's defeat against Arsenal and lost the ball 23 times. Henderson, usually a central midfielder, has not given the ball away as much all season for Liverpool. There hasn’t been a single one of his previous 29 Premier League appearances this season in which he’s lost possession more. 2. John O’Shea has clearly learned the canny defender’s art of letting his brain do all the running. The theory is if you get in the right position in the first place, you don’t have to chase to recover. In 90 minutes of helping Sunderland keep a clean sheet against Newcastle, the Ireland international logged just 11.9 metres at sprint speed on the EA Sports performance data. It clearly works for him – he’ll be 34 at the end of this month but remains the sole Premier League outfield player to have appeared in every minute of every game in all competitions for his club this season. . John O'Shea only sprinted 11.9 metres during his impressive display in Sunderland's 1-0 win over Newcastle. O'Shea (third left) celebrated Sunderland's win with Costel Pantilimon when the final whistle was blown. For good measure he’s also completed the full 90 minutes of all five European Championship qualifiers for the Republic. 3. Steven Caulker’s form has suffered from playing with too many different partners at QPR but there are signs the former Spurs and Cardiff centre half is returning to his best. . The 23-year-old was a towering figure as a West Brom side led by the powerful figure of substitute Victor Anichebe fought to recover from being three goals down at half-time. . Steven Caulker (right) wins a header against West Bromwich Albion striker Brown Ideye. Caulker made 20 clearances – as many as the rest of the Rangers back four put together – and more than any other Premier League defender all weekend. 4. Chelsea need have few fears if Diego Costa’s hamstring problems mean they have to rely on Loic Remy for goals in the last eight games of the season. . The France international’s tap-in from Eden Hazard’s pass for the winner against Stoke was his fifth Premier League goal of the season from just 456 minutes on the pitch. Loic Remy (centre) scored Chelsea's winner in their 2-1 victory over Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Remy could be vital to Chelsea as they look to win the Premier League title after Diego Costa went off injured. That’s a goal every 91 minutes – actually a better ratio than Costa whose 19 Premier League goals have come at the rate of one every 103 minutes. 5. Burnley boss Sean Dyche has talked about stability all season and continues to practise what he preaches. . He picked an unchanged side for the 16th time this season for the home clash with Tottenham and was rewarded with a valuable point. . Sean Dyche selected an unchanged side for the 16th time as Burnley drew 0-0 with Tottenham on Sunday. That’s more than double the number of times any other club has kept the same starting XI – next highest is Leicester with seven. 6. Kasper Schmeichel looked to have lost his first-team place at Leicester a few weeks ago following the arrival from Chelsea of veteran Mark Schwarzer. . But the 28-year-old son of Manchester United legend Peter returned for the 4-3 defeat at Tottenham just before the international break, and justified Nigel Pearson’s decision to keep him in the side with a brilliant display in the 2-1 win over West Ham. . Kasper Schmeichel made a string of outstanding stops as Leicester beat West Ham 2-1. Schmeichel made six saves as well as several vital catches – the only time he has made more saves in a game this season was the eight at Chelsea back in August that stopped a 2-0 defeat becoming a rout. 7. Swansea boss Garry Monk shared the club’s rise from football’s basement to the Premier League as a player, and isn’t afraid to back his belief there are more in League Two with the potential to play at the top. . He put his club’s money where his mouth is by signing Matt Grimes from Exeter for £1.75million in January, and has now given the 19-year-old his debut in the top flight. . Matt Grimes (right) impressed in his substitute appearance for Swansea in the 3-1 win against Hull . It wasn’t a bad little cameo, either. Swansea scored their third in the 3-1 win over Hull barely a minute after Grimes came on. 8. Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer left striker Jordan Rhodes out of his starting side for the 0-0 FA Cup quarter-final at Liverpool – but surely can’t drop him again for Wednesday’s replay. . The 25-year-old Scotland international is in the best scoring form of even his prolific career after netting the second of the 3-0 win at Leeds. It was his eighth goal in the last 12 games for Blackburn and took his total for the season to 17 from 35 Championship starts. Jordan Rhodes (right) scores Blackburn's second goal against Leeds in the Championship on Saturday. 9. Boyhood Hearts fan Jason Holt admitted he was upset at missing out on the celebrations when his old club clinched top spot in the Scottish Championship a few weeks ago. . But the midfielder who moved to Sheffield United in January might yet be able to open some bubbly with his new club after scoring in the 2-0 derby win at Barnsley. . It was the 22-year-old's third in as many games and gave Nigel Clough’s side a seven-point cushion for a place in the League One play-off zone. Midfielder Jason Holt (left) is proving important to Sheffield United's hopes of going up a division. John Akinde celebrates scoring for Barnet, where he has found the net 30 times in the league this season. 10. John Akinde has a peculiar place in the football history books for being the first player sold by an internet vote of fans – he was a promising teenager at Ebbsfleet in 2008 when the online poll decided to let him move to Bristol City. . The striker’s move never worked out – but seven years and nine clubs later he’s setting records again and this time for much better reasons. . His finish against Nuneaton that took Barnet back to the top of the Vanarama Conference was his 30th League goal of the season, equalling Gary Bull’s club record set in 1991. .  .",

    "document": "The Tulsa County reserve deputy who fatally shot a man instead of using his Taser turned himself in to authorities Tuesday at the Tulsa County Jail. Video shows Reserve Deputy Robert Bates announcing he is going to deploy his Taser after an undercover weapons sting on April 2 but then shooting Eric Courtney Harris in the back with a handgun. Bates was charged with second-degree manslaughter Monday. He surrendered Tuesday morning, accompanied by his attorney, Clark Brewster, and immediately posted bail of $25,000. As he exited the jailhouse, Bates paused in front of television cameras for a moment but did not speak. His attorney reiterated that he believes the charge against his client is unwarranted. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says a sting operation caught Harris illegally selling a gun. Harris ran when officers came in for the arrest. Authorities say Bates thought he pulled out his Taser but \"inadvertently\" fired his gun. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, told CNN that he is pleased District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler pressed charges. In his opinion, however, no type of force should have been used in the arrest of his brother. Watching the video of the shooting, Andre Harris said he can see that three or more officers were already on top of his brother. That manpower should have been enough to arrest him, he said. \"It was a situation where I didn't necessarily think that a Taser should even be used,\" Andre Harris said. Scott Wood, another Bates' attorney, has said the shooting was an \"excusable homicide.\" Investigators' efforts to defend Bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online. Harris' relatives are demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality. They're also questioning why the 73-year-old Bates -- the CEO of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high-risk sting operation. Daniel Smolen, an attorney representing the Harris family, said Bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time. Bates, who was a police officer for a year in the 1960s, had been a reserve deputy since 2008, with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience, according to the sheriff's office. He was also a frequent contributor to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, including $2,500 to the re-election of Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The sheriff's office has said that Bates had law enforcement certification, but Smolen said he has not seen any field training records. \"We're holding up all right at this point,\" Andre Harris said. \"We're putting our faith in God that justice will be served, and we can get some closure in this situation.\" How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? In a statement released Tuesday, Eric Harris' family members said they know there are many good deputies working in Tulsa County. \"However, the treatment of Eric of April 2 clearly shows that there is a deep-seated problem within the TCSO,\" the statement said. The family said that the sheriff has not apologized and that the department has not shown remorse or indication it will change its policies. CNN's Jason Morris and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.",

Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... . Queens Park Rangers. Rob Green - His dreadful kick led to Chelsea's late winner. Not a moment he'll want to remember in hurry. 5.5.

Nedum Onuoha - Strong display from the versatile defender, who now looks at home at centre-back. 7. Nedum Onuoha (15) performed well at the back for QPR and kept Didier Drogba quiet throughout. Clint Hill - Showed tremendous desire at left-back and did well to combat both Willian and Hazard. 7. Matt Phillips - Has shone in recent weeks for Rangers and caused Chelsea problems with his pace. 6.5. Joey Barton - Hurried and hassled Chelsea's midfield.

    "document": "The man who threw a banana peel at Dave Chappelle on Monday night denies he is racist, claiming it was 'just a joke'. Defending his actions, Christian Englander added that he threw another at a second black man just two days later - insisting that was also a joke. 'I'm sorry that my joke was misconstrued as a racial attack on Dave Chappelle,' the 30-year-old artist told The Albuquerque Journal. . The second, he threw because the 'irony of this situation is too much to pass up'. Englander was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct and battery during Chapelle's show in New Mexico. On Thursday, he claims to have hurled another banana peel at a man who confronted him about the first attack outside a Santa Fe bar. . Scroll down for video. Struck again: Christian Englander, 30, has thrown a banana peel at a black man for the second time in one week. He was arrested on Monday for hurling one at Dave Chappelle. On Thursday he struck again at a bar. Not amused: Santa Fe police say a man tossed a banana peel at Dave Chappelle during a show in New Mexico Monday, hitting in the comedian in the leg. Here Chappelle performs last summer. Chappelle was performing a comedy routine at the Lensic theater in Santa Fe when a banana peel struck him . According to Englander, his first attack came after Chappelle mocked his friend's name 'Johnny Appleseed'. . Police said the 30-year-old, from Santa Fe, appeared to be drunk as he sat near the stage. . According to TMZ, Englander thought Chappelle's quips were racist, so he decided to throw the peel, which he had in his pocket. . He had allegedly eaten the banana at a convenience store before the show, and washed it down with a shot of the alcoholic beverage 99 Bananas. After the attack, he was escorted out of the venue. On Thursday, he became embroiled in a fight with a man called Jay Wills, Oregon Live reports. Wills was allegedly upset about Englander's attack on Chappelle, and the two engaged in a heated argument, which was not reported to the police. . Englander has not been charged with the reported attack. . Racial attack: Chappelle told police Englander did not seem remorseful, and he believed the banana attack was racially motivated . Englander was in jail Tuesday, and Dobyns said she didn't know whether he has an attorney to speak on his behalf. Chappelle has had his share of run-ins with audience members in the past. Fueled up: Englander said he ate the banana and washed it down with a shot of 99 Bananas liquor before the show . In a 2013 gig in Hartford, Connecticut, Chappelle shut down his act after 10 minutes because of heckling. Known for his sharp commentary on race relations in America, Chappelle has gradually resumed his stand-up career in the past two years, making a long-awaited return after abruptly abandoning a popular Comedy Central show in 2005. Court documents indicate that following his arrest Monday night, Christian Englander 'appeared unapologetic and made several statements that appeared to be racially motivated.’. A criminal complaint cited by the Albuquerque Journal states that while smiling and laughing, Englander said: 'maybe I should have handed you [Chappelle] the banana instead.' Chappelle told police it seemed that his attacker was not remorseful and that the banana toss was 'racially motivated,' according to the complaint. The 41-year-old comedian indicated that he wanted to press charges against Englander. Once Englander was removed from the venue, Chappelle resumed his routine but spent the remainer of his set harping on the fruit fracas. ‘First I'm going to kill him with my comedy then I'm going to kick him in his f***ing face,’ he said, according to an audio recording made by an audience member and shared online. ‘By the way, these are empty threats.’. He later expressed a desire to hurl a tuna casserole in his assailant's face and to choke the life out of him - but noted that he wouldn't do it because it's against the law. The famed comedian took issue with the fact that the fruit hurled at him was not even fresh and marveled at the fact that someone would carry a banana peel in their pocket. ‘Why didn't he throw a good banana at me? Just the brown peel? Where's the rest of it? I am actually offended by the poor quality of the banana. It was brown, man,’ he was quoted as saying by the news blog NewsCastic. . But the pugnacious performer said he was not surprised that it happened to him. ‘I wish I could be, “I can't believe this is happening,” but in all honestly, I've been expecting that banana for many years,’ Chappelle told the crowd. ‘I just didn't know tonight was going to be the night.' The former Comedy Central star also used the incident to gently rib the popular comedy duo Key and Peele, who currently have a sketch show on the cable network. ‘Key and Peele probably did that s***,’ he joked, referring to the banana throw. ‘Key and Banana Peel.’. Chappelle is expected to carry on his comedy tour, performing a show in El Paso, Texas, Tuesday night.   . Not impressed: The famed comedian took issue with the fact that the fruit hurled at him was not even fresh.  .",

    "document": "A 17-year-old boy who was shot dead from behind by a police officer had just stolen a handgun, according to the police department in question. Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon. 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him. Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet. In the wake of his death, Howell's mother LaToya told Fox News her son 'couldn't have been a threat'. She said: 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police'. . 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' Peet appeared in court Monday on two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He is being held on a $15,000 bond. . Dumyahn said the Zion Police Department was releasing the narrative from the shooting because media outlets had linked Peet's case to the shooting. He said the department has 'no desire to defame the deceased'. Courts: Peet appeared in court Monday charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. Claim: Zion Police chief Steve Dumyahn said the department had 'no desire to defame' Howell, but released the details because media outlets realized his case and Peet's are connected. Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. . He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. . Witherspoon added: 'Here in America we are seeing this with too many brown and black boys.' Zion is a community of about 24,000 people along Lake Michigan, 45 miles north of Chicago, near Illinois' border with Wisconsin. Howell was a high school junior who transferred from a school in Wisconsin to Waukegan Public School District 60.  .",

    "document": "Tom Varndell helped himself to a hat-trick against London Welsh as Wasps won away from home in the Aviva Premiership for the first time in 2015 to keep their top-six hopes alive. Ahead of the trip to the Kassam Stadium, Wasps' hunt for an automatic European Rugby Champions Cup spot next season had stuttered after winning just one of their previous five fixtures in all competitions. However, they claimed a 40-13 win over Welsh with tries from Varndell, Ashley Johnson, Sailosi Tagicakibau and Alapati Leiua. Tom Varndell crosses for one of his three tries as Wasps ran out comfortable winners at the Kassam Stadium. It was far from plain sailing for Wasps, though as the Exiles, whose defeat to Bath last time out confirmed that they will finish bottom of the table, trailed 12-5 at half-time after Opeti Fonua bundled over after the first two of Varndell's tries. But Johnson dotted down and Varndell added his third before Tagicakibau secured the bonus point for Wasps, with Alapati Leiua getting in on the act with the last play of the game. Chris Elder scored Welsh's second try of the match in the second period. Wasps got off to a fast start at the Kassam as they went 12 points clear after as many minutes. The visitors found the tryline after only four minutes as Varndell broke down the right flank and scored in the corner, veteran fly-half Andy Goode converting well from a tight angle. Welsh then went down to 14 men eight minutes later when Koree Britton was sent to the sin bin for pulling down a maul and Wasps instantly capitalised as Varndell grabbed his second try. Seb Stegmann is tackled by Carlo Festuccia as the exiles put up a fight, but faded away again. Alapati Leiua breaks away to score a late try as Wasps pulled away in the closing stages . The Exiles crept back into the game, though, keeping the pressure on Wasps' defence and Fonua forced his way through to make it 12-5, Tristan Roberts kicking the conversion side. Welsh started the second half well and Roberts made amends for his earlier miss as he calmly kicked a penalty between the posts to reduce the arrears even further. But Wasps soon began to dominate and a lineout close to the try-line was bundled over by Johnson in his first start as hooker. Then a swift break down the right saw Varndell free to run back around the Welsh defence and score under the posts for his hat-trick. Elder scored a try out of nowhere four minutes later for the Exiles on his Aviva Premiership debut, as he found space on the left wing to touch down in the corner. Wasps instantly replied though as Tagicakibau finished a great run through the centre by reaching for the line. And the game ended on a high for Wasps as Leiua finished the scoring with a darting run through the middle. James Cannon wins a line-out for Wasps ahead of London Welsh's Matt Corker as Wasps recovered their form. Andy Goode adds extras as Wasps renewed their chase for a European Champions Cup place.  .",

The 25-year-old boytoy is the lover, of a Dominican woman in her late 30s, who invites him round for romps around her entire apartment in Brooklyn. The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex. Most complained: The building maintenance worker (left) and his girlfriend (right), who is now four months pregnant, were complained about six times for excessive noise at the Bay Ridge block, official records show. Say it loud: This is the apartment block with six calls made to 311 - New York city's non-emergency number - because of complaints of loud sex.

The woman whose moans during sex sparked the highest number of complaints in New York said today: 'I'm not hurting anyone'. The woman, who declined to give her name, walked out of the apartment block wearing striped maxi dres, a white jacket and sunglasses.

I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. . The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. . Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'. On the job: The building handyman complained about over noisy sex was at work today - at the apartment block where his girlfriend lives. . House of noise: The apartment building is in Bay Ridge, close to New York harbor in Brooklyn.

The complainant told the website the woman was 'moaning and screaming \"Oh yeah, oh, do it to me\".' It was followed by another woman shouting at the couple: 'Shut your f***ing windows you wh**e.'

Sagna's acrimonious departure from Arsenal when his contract expired at the end of last season left many Gunners fans dismayed at a perceived lack of loyalty from the defender. The France international has played only 16 times for City this season in an underwhelming campaign both for him and the Premier League holders, who are languishing in fourth. Bacary Sagna (right) insists he does not regret leaving Arsenal for Manchester City last summer. Sangna (right) has only made 16 appearances and City are fourth in the Premier League, with Arsenal second. Sagna departed Arsenal on the back of winning the FA Cup but faces a year without a trophy at City. But the 32-year-old Sagna says if he was faced with the decision again, he would make the same choice. 'I see a lot of comments from fans saying I should have stayed at Arsenal but if I had to do it again, if I had to come back and sign for City, I would have done it again,' Sagna told the Manchester Evening News. 'I'm happy because I came to the champions.' Sagna departed the Emirates on the back of an FA Cup triumph but arrived at City with the club having won the Premier League. A year later, Arsenal are gearing up to defend their trophy against Aston Villa in the final at Wembley but City's Premier League title will almost certainly be claimed by Chelsea.

Sagna said. Sagna (left) said he would make the same decision again if he was faced with a similar choice . Sagna believes Manuel Pellegrini's City side will soon return to winning ways and end the season well. Sanga also brushed aside fears that City could be usurped from the Champions League qualifying places and believes Manuel Pellegrini's side will swiftly return to winning ways.

    "document": "Former Leeds and England coach Tony Smith admits he was shocked by Kevin Sinfield's decision to switch codes but, on reflection, believes it could be an inspired decision. Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist. .

Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. . Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final. Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year. 'I think it's fantastic to make that decision to bow out of Super League probably at the right time,' Smith added. 'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage. 'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right. I'm no expert on when other people should retire but I'm pleased for Kevin and he'll certainly give everything he's got to his new employers. 'That's how he's been in rugby league and I've got no reason to think it'll be any different.' Sinfield has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of Jason Robinson, Andy Farrell and Sam Burgess. 'Ideally I'd like to play fly-half,' Sinfield said. 'It's the position that suits the skill set I have the best. . Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge. 'I understand the challenge that's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over. That's why I think I'm in the best possible place to help with that transition. 'Playing union is something I've always wanted to do. I didn't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities. When this opportunity came up I knew it was the right thing. 'I'm excited by it. I know the potential at the club and it's something I'd like to be a part of. 'I'm very respectful of the game and I like watching it. I think a lot of rugby league people look down on rugby union, and I think a lot of rugby union people look down on rugby league. But I like both games. As a sportsman, to get the opportunity to play another professional sport is something that really appeals to me.'  .",

    "document": "Birmingham is the rat capital of the UK and the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs, according to new research. The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. . Scroll down for video . A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs. Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. . A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_. While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland.  . The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. . 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.' Wasp numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years (left) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country (right) The number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in Scotland in the last five years, data showed, with those in Fife most likely to report a problem.  .",

    "document": "According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, \"(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia.\" The Columbia team concluded that \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, \"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that \"the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent.\" \"Actionable\" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \"true.\" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is \"concerning\" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about \"a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue.\" If I said, \"The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals\" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the \"small group\" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are \"between jobs,\" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.",

Liverpool offered Ibe fresh terms in February after he had a deep impression in a sequence of games, particularly against Everton and Tottenham, that coincided with an improvement in the club’s fortunes. A deal has now been agreed and it is simply a case of the highly-regarded Ibe, who has been absent since damaging knee ligaments against Besiktas on February 26, putting pen to paper. Jordon Ibe in training for Liverpool at Melwood as he prepares to make a return from injury. Ibe is set to sign a new long-term deal at Liverpool after breaking into the first team this season. Rodgers says Ibe, 19, has looked ‘absolutely sensational’ after stepping up his rehabilitation work in the last couple of weeks and he could come straight back into the starting line-up against Newcastle on Monday night. The issue Rodgers must address is whether to stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used at Blackburn in the FA Cup last Wednesday or revert to the 3-4-3 system that had been the catalyst for an improvement in results. . One thing Liverpool’s manager has conceded, though, is that Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season, given all the injuries he has suffered. Ibe, pictured in action against Tottenham, damaged his knee ligaments while playing against Besiktas. Sturridge, who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games, admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year’s sparkle and his manager agrees, following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh, calf and hip issues. ‘It’s a long time out,’ said Rodgers. ‘When you’re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. ‘The key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt, a total run at pre-season and hopefully he’ll be fine for next season. Until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him.’. Brendan Rodgers prepares his Liverpool team for the visit of Newcastle to Anfield on Monday. Daniel Sturridge is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off. Rodgers added: ‘Every player is different. With Daniel there’s been a number of injuries that he’s had and that’s before he came here. He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult. ‘He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that isn’t all down to you — sometimes it’s about luck as well.’.",

    "document": "Andy Murray and his Davis Cup colleagues have got their preferred venue by securing London’s Queen’s Club as the place where they will take on France in their quarter final. The venerable club in Baron’s Court will host Britain’s biggest home tie in three decades from July 17-19, after agreement was reached between its management and the Lawn Tennis Association today. British Captain Leon Smith and his lead player had made it clear that they wanted to take on the strong French team on grass, as it would appear to give them fewer selection options from their rich resources. Andy Murray in action last year at the Queen's Club, which will host the Davis Cup quarter final against France. Murray celebrates winning at Queen's in 2013 - one of three triumphs he has had at the tournament. Tickets go on sale on May 27 and the match is sure to sell out quickly with the likely capacity of the one court used being around 7,000, as it is for the AEGON Championships, which takes place two weeks before Wimbledon. The All England Club’s overworked show courts, plus the redevelopment work being done there, meant that SW19 was never an option only five days after the Championships finish. The fixture means a bumper helping of six weeks’ top level grass court tennis in the UK this summer, a far cry from 20 years ago when some believed the sport’s one organic surface might even disappear. This time there will be three weeks between Roland Garros and Wimbledon, so by the time GB take on France for a place in the World Group semi-finals all the players will be perfectly attuned to the grass. The court at Queen’s is at least the equal of Wimbledon in terms of quality, and the atmosphere will be very different from the usually staid one that accompanies the principle warm-up event for the big fortnight. Thanks to Murray, GB and France look well-matched and it could well depend on who wins the doubles rubber on the Saturday. France has seven players in the world’s singles top 50, although some have been affected by injuries this season. However, they will be encouraged by the recent comeback of Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who is their best grass court exponent and looking in decent form after overcoming arm problems. He has done well at Queen’s before but his record is not as impressive as that of Murray, who has won the pre-Wimbledon title three times. Murray said: 'Queen’s will be a perfect venue for our quarter-final match against France. I’ve been playing at Queen’s for ten years now so I feel very at home there as do the rest of the British team, so it’s a great choice. Fingers crossed it’s a memorable summer for British tennis.' Jo Wilfried Tsonga is back to form after overcoming an arm problem and will be a big threat for the French.  .",

    "document": "The wife of a Detroit-area soccer referee filed a $51 million lawsuit Friday against a hot-headed player who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer. The figure represents $1 million for each of the 51 additional years that John Bieniewicz, 44, could have lived, according to the lawsuit in Wayne County court. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland, the representative of her husband's estate, is suing Bassel Saad, along with another man who controlled the team and the soccer league. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland (pictured left with her late husband) has filed a $51 million lawsuit against Bassel Saad (right) who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer. Bieniewicz died after Saad punched him in the head just moments before Saad would have been ejected from a weekend game in Livonia. Dr. Jamal Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other, and performed CPR which failed to work. . 'We hope this lawsuit sends a message that when you commit uncivilized acts in a civilized world there are consequences, even beyond the criminal realm,' said attorney James Acho, who had known Bieniewicz since childhood. Cyril Hall, Saad's attorney in the criminal case, said Friday that the lawsuit surprises him. 'Bassel Saad is not an individual of wealth. He was a mechanic,' Hall said. Behind bars: Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. The Associated Press left messages seeking comment from a telephone listing for the soccer league. Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. . He expressed remorse in court and said he prays for the Bieniewicz family. The lawsuit also names the Michigan United Soccer League, which is accused of allowing Saad to play despite his reputation as a violent player. Citing his doctor, the lawsuit described Bieniewicz, who had two children, as being in great health with the potential to live to age 95. Bieniewicz is pictured being administered CPR on the turf after being knocked out cold by Saad. 'I speak for his dozens of buddies, many of whom go back to our days at Catholic Central High, and we want justice for his family,' said Acho, who is handling the case with co-counsel Karen Daley. . In 2005, Saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field. Court documents obtained by Detroit Free Press indicate that he repeatedly struck another player in the head. Saad pleaded no contest in that case and was sentenced to five days of community service and 12 months of probation. Mrs Bieniewicz testified at Michigan's Capitol earlier this year in support of proposed legislation that would make it a felony to assault a sports official in the state. Referees ‘are out there on an island with no one to defend them,' she said. 'Something more than a misdemeanor should be in place.' . Mrs Bieniewicz said that through everything, her only consolation has been the thought that her husband died doing something he loved.",

A James Forrest strike and Stefan Johansen’s penalty were enough to see off a spirited challenge by the bottom side as Celtic moved eight points clear of Aberdeen. But although pleased with the way his side stayed patient to win, Deila felt their cause wasn’t helped by the state of the Paisley surface. And he believes Scottish football will struggle to develop top players if there isn’t a drastic improvement in our pitches. Celtic manager Ronny Deila was impressed with his side's performance against St Mirren on Friday night. ‘It was a tough game, St Mirren were well organised and played very deep,’ he said. ‘They fought really hard and it was difficult to break them down. We had to be patient. The pitch was better than some others we’ve played on. But the pitches in Scotland are terrible. ‘If you want to develop players and get passing football, it’s difficult when the ball is bouncing all the time. It’s much easier for the other teams to just sit behind the ball and try to break down our play. ‘It’s better to play on an artificial surface than this. If they are watering artificial pitches and they are of the best quality, it’s totally different and much closer to European standards. James Forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring Celtic's opening goal against St Mirren. ‘If we are going to develop good young players, you need a good surface to play and train on. If not, you get fighters. If you want skills and technique, play on better surfaces. ‘They are much better in Norway. Sixty per cent are artificial and the grass pitches are better as well because they don’t train there and there aren’t other teams playing on them. And we play in the summer. That’s the biggest thing. The pitch here might not look so bad but try to play on it.’. TV pictures showed Leigh Griffiths eating a chocolate biscuit while sitting on the bench. But Deila, a strong advocate of fitness and conditioning, laughed it off. ‘I think it was a carbo biscuit which is totally different! I’ll have to check his weight tomorrow.’. Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side's 2-0 victory. Goalscorer Johansen believes there’s no stopping Celtic as they close in on a treble. ‘It looks great for us now,’ he said. ‘I don’t think we’re unbeatable but there is a huge confidence in the team. ‘We are starting to look fitter and have much more of the ball because we’re playing with a higher tempo. That’s the way the manager wants us to play. I said in the beginning when people were asking questions I was confident he would be a great and it’s starting to look that way.’. Saints boss Gary Teale felt there were positives in defeat but wasn’t happy about the handball awarded against Viktor Genev for Celtic’s penalty. ‘Was it ball to hand or hand to ball? If they’re going to give penalties for things like that they need to give all of them in every single game.’. Deila berated the state of pitches in Scotland and claimed it would be better to play on artificial surfaces.",

    "document": "While the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq holds the world's gaze, a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention: the deterioration of al Qaeda. In an audio message released Sunday, al Qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders, known as Ustad Ahmad Farooq and Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in CIA drone strikes in January in North Waziristan, near the Afghan-Pakistan border. Farooq's real name was Raja Mohammad Suleman, al Qaeda said. He was a Pakistani who acted as the group's liaison to the Pakistan Taliban and was the deputy commander of al Qaeda's South Asia branch. (Mansur's real name was Qari Ubaidullah, a Pakistani who oversaw suicide missions against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan). Al Qaeda's South Asia branch is relatively new, announced with some fanfare back in September by al Qaeda's top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The creation of the terror group's South Asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from ISIS, which is embroiled in a public dispute with al Qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement. The deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al Qaeda's bench of leaders. On Monday, in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, local al Qaeda commander Nurul Hassan was killed in a raid, said Arif Hanif, district inspector general of police. Florida-raised Adnan Shukrijumah, 39, who was in charge of al Qaeda's operations to attack the West, was killed in December in a Pakistani military operation. Texas-born Mohanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, who also played a planning role for al Qaeda's operations, was arrested in Pakistan last year. The deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of al Qaeda left except al-Zawahiri. Both Ubaidullah and Suleman were Pakistani. This is an indicator of how al Qaeda has become a largely Pakistan-focused group, increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of Pakistan or Afghanistan. Indeed, al Qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the West. The last successful al Qaeda attack in the West was the London transportation system bombings a decade ago. Al Qaeda is now reduced only to holding American hostages such as 73-year-old aid worker Warren Weinstein, who was kidnapped from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore on August 13, 2011. To be sure, al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, continues to pose a threat to American aviation. The group has built hard-to-detect bombs, which it has placed on U.S.-bound flights. Luckily, those bombs were faulty or were detected. The group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January, killing 12, but it's not clear if AQAP had any direct role in planning this attack. Meanwhile, ISIS continues to attract Western recruits and also inspire \"homegrown\" terrorists in the West, but the core al Qaeda organization that killed almost 3,000 men, women and children on 9/11 is on life support. Al Qaeda's confirmation of the deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment.",

    "document": "Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for \"lost\" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the \"holiday\" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the \"mistake\" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut. Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the \"war on women\" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious \"war on women\" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap. But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The \"war on women\" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the \"war on women\" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative \"solution\" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.",

    "document": "A top television producer is suing his ex-wife for more than £300,000, claiming that she lied to him about being the father of her son. Chris Lewis, 68, has brought the unusual court case against 48-year-old former wife Nicola over the child he helped raise as his own for 17 years. In court documents he claims Mrs Lewis had sex with another man only a few months into their marriage, but did not tell him. She had a child – Charlie, now 19 – as a result but led him to believe the boy was his, he argues. Suing ex-wife: Chris Lewis, 68 (left) has accused his former partner Nicola, 48 (right) of duping him about the paternity of her son Charlie. DNA tests now prove that Charlie is not his biological son, he says, and as a result of the deception he suffered loss and damages – and wants compensation totalling £322,400. The claim, made in documents before the High Court in London, says that the pair married in October 1994 and that Mrs Lewis gave birth to Charlie in March 1996. The couple separated in May 1999. Although Charlie subsequently lived with his mother, Mr Lewis says he ‘would see him regularly and make financial contributions towards his maintenance and advancement’. He claims that his ex-wife continued to lead him to believe that he was the boy’s biological father and he was recorded as such on the birth certificate. He was discussed as being the father in the course of the couple’s divorce, with Mrs Lewis signing ‘statements of truth maintaining that was the case’. Everything changed in April 2013, however, shortly after Charlie’s 17th birthday, when both he and Mr Lewis had DNA tests. They are said to have proven beyond doubt that Mr Lewis was not the boy’s father. The court documents claim that Mrs Lewis’s repeated assertions that her ex-husband was the father of her child ‘were made fraudulently’ with her ‘knowing them to be false or not caring whether they were true or false’. Mr Lewis’s lawyers say that Mrs Lewis ‘had sexual intercourse with David Alderson or an unknown person which resulted in the conception of Charlie in or around May or June 1995’. High-profile contract: Mr Lewis's company, Chris Lewis Media, provided coverage of the Equestrian events at the London Olympics and the TV producer brought Charlie to the venue during the games. They add: ‘On no occasion during the parties’ marriage did Mrs Lewis inform Mr Lewis that she had had sexual intercourse with another person/persons. ‘She knew that Mr Lewis was not the biological father of Charlie, or was reckless as to whether he was the biological father, or did not believe he was the biological father. ‘By reason of her deceit and misrepresentations, Mr Lewis has suffered loss and damage, and claims damages plus interest.’. Mr Lewis was for decades one of the BBC’s leading sports producers, masterminding footage of every Olympic Games since 1972 as well as working on coverage of ten football World Cups. Since leaving the BBC in 2006, he has specialised in equestrian sports. He is understood to have taken Charlie to equestrian events at the London 2012 Olympics, which his TV company Chris Lewis Media was filming, a few months before he discovered he was not the boy’s father. Speaking about the court case, Mr Lewis, of Twickenham, South West London, said: ‘It’s been a very hurtful time for all parties.’. Mrs Lewis lives in a £1.2million house in Shepperton, Surrey, and is a company director of a fireplace shop. She told the Daily Mail last night: ‘I haven’t even looked at the document from court, and I can’t say anything because it’s in the hands of my solicitors.’. David Alderson, 59, of Cobham, Surrey, who is alleged to be a former lover of Mrs Lewis and the possible father of her child, was unavailable for comment last night. .",

    "document": "David Cameron has a 'secret plan' to cut taxes for millionaires after the General Election, Ed Balls claimed today as Labour ramped up its attack on the eighth day of campaigning. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less'. But the Prime Minister hailed today as 'money-back Monday' - with a raft of tax changes coming into force putting more cash in voters' wallets. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls, speaking in Leeds this morning, ramped up his attack on the Tories today - claiming that David Cameron was planning a VAT increase and cuts to the top rate of tax. Mr Cameron has claimed that Labour are planning to increase taxes by £3,028 on 'every working family'. . But, speaking in Leeds this morning, Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000 from 45p to 40p. Tory Treasury minister David Gauke hit back with an accusation that Labour has a secret plan to boost revenues by dragging more workers into the 40p higher rate of income tax and increasing national insurance contributions. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone. Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, who cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p in his 2012 Budget, each refused to rule out a further cut to 40p in comments on Sunday. . They are expected to come under further pressure on the issue during campaigning in the South West. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost £1,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less'  Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000 from 45p to 40p. Mr Balls said: 'We know that is their secret plan - another big tax cut for millionaires. 'How can it be fair when families here in Leeds and across the country are struggling and £1,100 a year worse-off? 'How can it be fair to have a tax cut for the very richest when our NHS is in crisis and going backwards? 'How can this be fair when we need to get the deficit down and the Tories are now planning deeper cuts in the next three years than the last five?' Mr Balls said a cut in the top rate to 40p would save someone earning £1 million a year £340,000 over the course of the next Parliament, while someone with income of £5 million would get a total tax cut of £1.94 million over the five-year period. Meanwhile, he said that unfunded Conservative plans to cut £10 million from income tax by raising thresholds for the 20p and 40p rates would require the equivalent of a two-point rise in VAT, costing an average couple with children £1,440 over four years. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg meets supporters at the Grove Pub while out campaigning in Surbiton, London. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' Voters would not believe Mr Cameron's denial that he intends to increase the consumption tax, because Conservatives had 'a track record of breaking their promises on VAT', he said. However, Conservatives claimed secret Labour plans for tax rises would cost each working family more than £3,000 over the course of the next five years - an estimate which was dismissed as unfounded by independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies a week ago. Mr Gauke said: 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband must set out the details of their secret plan for GBP3,028 of tax rises on every working family - the British people have a right to know what these tax hikes are. The choice at this election is clear. Lower taxes under David Cameron. Or higher taxes under Ed Miliband and the SNP.' Mr Balls insisted that Labour will not raise VAT, national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax if it wins the general election. But he confirmed that the party would restore the 50p top rate for earnings over £150,000, as well as imposing a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes. Mr Clegg hit out at both sides and warned only his party can ensure a balanced plan to clear the deficit. He said millions of people would get a tax cut worth almost £400 from a Liberal Democrat pledge to push the income tax personal allowance to £12,500. . By contrast, Labour's plan to reintroduce the 10p starter rate of income tax would be worth just £37 to taxpayers. 'Labour's short-term economic plan will lead to mounting borrowing and leave taxpayers short by hundreds of pounds, which is unfair and reckless,' said Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in Kingston-upon-Thames and the South West. 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's tax plans are economically illiterate. Labour has already failed to commit the £8 billion needed for the NHS, and are now failing to give taxpayers the tax cut they deserve.' Mr Clegg met Elise Popperwell - aged just seven months - and her mother Melissa Popperwell while out campaigning in Surbiton. Mr Balls said: 'All of our plans are fully costed and paid for. None of our manifesto commitments will require a single pound of extra borrowing ... 'So this is the choice at the election, a choice between a Conservative Party which has a track record of breaking their promises on VAT and will raise it again after the election or a Labour Party which has never raised VAT and will not raise VAT in the next Parliament. 'A Tory way which means millions pay more while millionaires pay less, or Labour's plan to back millions of working people, save our NHS and balance the books in a fair way.' Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was concentrating on his own constituency of South Thanet, where a weekend poll suggested he was trailing in second place in the close three-way marginal. On a campaign visit to Surbiton, south-west London, Mr Clegg said that Liberal Democrats had blocked Tory plans to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p during the coalition. Conservative ministers were 'always more interested in tax cuts for people at the top rather than tax cuts for people at the bottom or the middle', Mr Clegg told Sky News. 'I was very amused yesterday to hear George Osborne and David Cameron saying with earnest sincerity that they had no plan of giving further tax cuts to people at the top because, I tell you, they had exactly that plan in government and it was something that we said we would not go along with.' Mr Clegg's comments came after Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told The Independent that during coalition negotiations over tax cuts, a Conservative minister told him: 'You take care of the workers and we'll take care of the bosses.'",

The dog caused a severe fire after managing to switch on the cooker while trying to reach his dog treats. The heat from one of the hob's rings set fire to a child's seat that had been left resting on the electric appliance. Fire starter: Hungry Leo almost burned down his owner's home  as he hunted for his dog treats. The blaze was started after the Staffordshire-Boxer cross was believed to have knocked one of the cooker knobs, switching on the hob. Smoke began to fill the three storey home in Peckham, south-east London, as owner Allen Mosey's son, 21, and his daughter's boyfriend relaxed in upstairs rooms. The pair   managed to flee unharmed with Leo after noticing thick black smoke billowing up the stairs. More than 10 firefighters were needed to extinguish the flames. . A search of the house later revealed that the source of fire was the cooker. Firefighters believe that when Leo was hunting for food he knocked one of the cooker's knobs, turning the rings on. The blaze damaged one third of the ground floor of the property and Leo's family have been left surviving on sandwiches. . 'You wouldn't think butter would melt in his mouth to look at him,' Mr Mosey, 67, told the Southwark News. 'He's the most docile dog you could think of.'

A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: 'We're naturally extremely pleased that no one was injured in this fire and while unusual, it's not unheard of for our crews to deal with incidents like this.

    "document": "It's T20 season on the sub-continent and the world's best players are about the pad up for the latest edition of the Indian Premier League, cricket's most exciting and richest domestic tournament. Eight teams will play a total of 60 games over almost seven weeks across 12 venues all round India in a battle to be crowned champions of the tournament's eighth edition, with the final taking place at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on May 24. Can Kolkata Knight Riders retain their title? Will Virat Kohli lead the Royal Challengers Bangalore to their first title? Can MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings win their third crown? And who are the players to watch out for? Sportsmail tells you all you need to know in our guide to the 2015 Indian Premier League as India prepares for the spectacular cricket roadshow. MS Dhoni, pictured in the 2011 Champions League, is looking to guide Chennai Super Kings to a third title. CHENNAI SUPER KINGS. The bright yellow jerseys of the Super Kings are one of the iconic sights of the Indian Premier League. Led by the superstar Indian duo of MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina, Chennai are the most successful team in IPL history. As well as their back-to-back victories in 2010 and 2011, CSK have been losing finalists three times and never failed to reach the last four. In international players Dhoni, Raina, Ravi Ashwin, Ravi Jadeja and Mohit Sharma, the Super Kings have probably the best pool of Indian talent in the tournament, which is key given that seven of the starting XI have to be domestic players. The foreign talent is also strong, though, and includes New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, South African Faf du Plessis and West Indian all-rounder Dwyane Bravo. ONE TO WATCH: There are so many. Dhoni needs no introduction, Raina is the top scorer in IPL history, but MCCULLUM is one of the most exciting players in world cricket at the moment. He hit the first ever IPL century in 2008 and will be looking to build on a brilliant World Cup campaign. Brendon McCullum's aggressive brand of cricket led New Zealand to the World Cup final. £1,740,000 - Yuvraj Singh's salary, the highest in the 2015 tournament after he was picked up by Delhi Daredevils in the auction. . 3325 - runs Suresh Raina has scored, the most in tournament history. 2008 - Year the IPL was first played. 119 - wickets taken by Lasith Malinga, the most in the history of the tournament. 60 - matches in the 2015 tournament. 46 - days the tournament lasts, beginning on April 8 and ending on May 24. 12 - venues to be used in 2015. 8 - teams in 2015 edition of the IPL. 3 -  English players in the tournament - Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara and Kevin Pietersen. DELHI DAREDEVILS. The side from the capital are out to prove a point having never won the tournament and never even reached the final. The Daredevils have missed out on the semi-finals the last two seasons and will be looking to get back on track this year. . They are led by South African JP Duminy and a lot of their overseas talent also comes from the same country in the form of Quinton de Kock, Imran Tahir and Albie Morkel, although Sri Lankan all-rounder Angelo Mathews is a handy player as well. World Cup outcasts Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra, all of whom featured in India's successful 2011 team, will relish a return to the big stage and try and force themselves back into international reckoning. ONE TO WATCH: In 22-year-old DE KOCK, Delhi have the most exciting young wicketkeeper batsman in the world. De Kock has already scored six one-day international tons but his highest score in the World Cup was an unbeaten 78. 2011 World Cup winner Yuvraj Singh will be out to prove a point after being left out of this year's India team. KINGS XI PUNJAB. After years of just making up the numbers, the Kings XI Punjab lit up the 2014 tournament on their way to topping the table in the round-robin stage before losing in the final. Punjab's success in 2014 came largely thanks to their strong Australian contingent, and this year they will be just as reliant on the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, George Bailey and Shaun Marsh. But the Kings XI also have South African powerhouse David Miller in their ranks along with Sri Lankan Thisara Perera. Their Indian talent isn't the strongest in the tournament but Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay have both performed on the big stage for their country, and 21-year-old Axar Patel is one of the best young talents in India. ONE TO WATCH: The destructive MAXWELL. One banner in the stands in Chandigarh last year read 'Glenndeep Singh Maxwell - the King of Punjab'. It was Maxwell's power-hitting that almost led his team to the 2014 title and he showed again at the World Cup just how dangerous he can be. Glenn Maxwell was one of the top run-scorers in the IPL last year and almost guided the Kings XI to the title. KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS. The reigning champions Knight Riders have one of the most balanced teams in the tournament and will be looking to win their third IPL title in four years. Gautam Gambhir's international career may have stalled, but he is still one of the most talented Indian batsmen out there. Along with Gambhir, Yusuf Pathan was also part of India's 2011 World Cup winning team while Robin Uthappa was the leading run-scorer last year with 660. In terms of overseas talent, Kolkata boast Sunil Narine, Morne Morkel, Johan Botha, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib-al-Hasan and Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate. ONE TO WATCH: It's rare for India to produce fast bowlers with genuine pace, but they have one in UMESH YADAV. Kolkata will be looking for Yadav to combine with Morkel and Narine as part of a fearsome bowling attack. Sunil Narine, pictured in action for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 Indian Premier League. MUMBAI INDIANS. The team that once featured the great Sachin Tendulkar finally won the IPL in 2013, and they have an excellent chance to lift their second title this year. In Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha and Parthiv Patel, Mumbai have a strong core of Indian talent, but it is their overseas game-winners that makes them dangerous. Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga is the highest wicket-taker in tournament history with 119, and he is joined by Kieron Pollard, Aaron Finch, Corey Anderson and Josh Hazlewood. After losing in the eliminator against Chennai last year, the Mumbai Indians will once again expect to reach the play-offs and mount a serious challenge for the title. ONE TO WATCH: The demon bowler that is MALINGA has made a habit of cleaning up batsmen in the IPL and was key in their success in 2013. He will once again lead this bowling attack. . Mumbai Indians batsman Rohit Sharma pictured in action for India against Bangladesh at the World Cup. 2008: Rajasthan Royals. 2009: Deccan Chargers (defunct) 2010: Chennai Super Kings. 2011: Chennai Super Kings. 2012: Kolkata Knight Riders. 2013: Mumbai Indians. 2014: Kolkata Knight Riders . RAJASTHAN ROYALS. Since Shane Warne's side won the inaugural IPL in 2008, the Rajasthan Royals have only made the play-offs on one occasion since. Rajasthan's short history has been eventful to say the lease. They were expelled by the BCCI and then reinstated in 2010 and were also rocked by the spot-fixing scandal that saw former Test match bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth banned for life. This year's Royals team features a strong Australian presence in captain Shane Watson, Steve Smith and James Faulkner as well as New Zealand seamer Tim Southee. Their Indian talent lacks star quality, though, with Ajinkya Rahane, Stuart Binny and Dhawal Kulkarni the only men who have forced their way into the national side. ONE TO WATCH: Australian SMITH has enjoyed a summer of dominating India and was instrumental in his country winning the World Cup. Smith is a dangerous player with the bat, can hold up his end with the ball and is also one of the best fielders in the tournament. Steve Smith will look to continue his excellent form into the Indian Premier League with Rajasthan. Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, pictured in 2009, is a part owner of the Rajasthan Royals. ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE. Any batting order that contains Chris Gayle, AB de Villers and Kohli has half a chance, but it has been Bangalore's bowling that has held them back in recent years. Bangalore have never won the IPL and have missed out on the play-offs altogether in the last three years. The Royal Challengers paid big money in the auction to pick up Dinesh Karthik (£1.17million) in an attempt to shake off their underachievers tag. But news that World Cup player of the tournament Mitchell Starc will miss the start of the IPL will hurt their bowling attack. ONE TO WATCH: Any of their big three batsmen really, but DE VILLIERS is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket for his stunning range of shots.  . Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle pictured playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2012 tournament. South African AB de Villiers is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket. SUNRISERS HYDERABAD. The newest team in the Indian Premier League, the Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to embark on their third campaign having been founded in 2013 and replaced the Deccan Chargers. The Sunrisers will be led up front by the explosive opening duo of David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan and their middle order will feature New Zealander Kane Williamson and English duo Ravi Bopara and Eoin Morgan. Hyderabad also landed Kevin Pietersen in the auction for what looked like a bargain of £205,000 after he was released by the Delhi Daredevils, but the 34-year-old will not feature in the orange shirt unless they make the play-offs. Pietersen reached the agreement with the Sunrisers in order to return to Surrey in an attempt to resurrect his England career, but the play-offs take place during the same week as England's first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. The Sunrisers also boast a a strong bowling line-up with foreign stars Dale Steyn and Trent Boult supported by Indian internationals Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. ONE TO WATCH: Hyderabad's strength is up top with captain Warner and DHAWAN. The Indian batsman scored two centuries at the recent World Cup and, like Warner, has the power to take the game away from the opposition if he's there for a while. Eoin Morgan will look to move on quickly from England's miserable World Cup when he plays in the IPL. Kevin Pietersen, here playing for Delhi in 2012, will join Hyderabad if they make the play-offs.  .",

    "document": "A group of Muslim migrants have been arrested for 'aggravated murder' after allegedly throwing 12 Christians into the Mediterranean sea during a recent crossing from Libya, Italian police reports. Witnesses say a fight broke out on a rubber dinghy carrying more than 100 African migrants from Libya to Sicily, after which the men were thrown to their deaths. A group of 15 men have now been arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate,' Palermo police said in a statement. Murders: A fight over religion broke out on a boat carrying 105 migrants from Libya, after which 12 men 'professing the Christian faith' were thrown to their deaths. Pictured: Migrants are transferred to holding centers after disembarking from in Augusta's port, near Siracusa, Sicily. Italian police say they were informed of the alleged attacks by a group of Nigerian and Ghanaian survivors upon their arrival in Palermo, Sicily yesterday. The survivors said they had boarded a rubber boat on the Libyan coast on April 14, which had 105 passengers aboard. During the crossing, a fight broke out over religion, with the group of Muslim passengers threatening the Nigerians and Ghanaians after the latter declared themselves to be Christians.

But they were left disappointed after pumping the liquid to the surface, only to discover it was so polluted that they could set it on fire. Residents of Ansai, in Shaanxi Province, central China, said they could smell gas and petrol coming from the well, and blame a leak from a local petrol station, The People's Daily Online reports. Villagers in Ansai, Shaanxi Province, in central China, dug a 46m well in order to get fresh drinking water, but when the pumped it to the surface the found it was so polluted it could be set on fire. Local officials say they have now launched an investigation into how the water from the well, which cost £1,000 to build, became so polluted. Locals said they could smell  petrol when the water surfaced, and blame the pollution on a leak from a local gas petrol station, a claim which the owner denies. However, when Chinese officials investigated, they said they could find no trace of a spillage, leading some people to theorise that the villagers could have struck oil. However this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits only occur between 750 and 4,500m underground, and the well is only 46m deep. Tuo Zhijun, a villager in Ansai, said: 'Who knew when we turned on the pump, once the water was seeping through, everyone could smell gas and see oil slick.' Some locals have suggested that the lucky villager may have struck oil, but this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits typically occur between 750 and 4,5000m underground, and the well is only 46m deep. After drawing the first fresh water out of their new well, the villagers discovered they were able to set it on fire because it was so polluted. Local officials do not yet know exactly what substance is in the water, though they say they are conducting a specific investigation to discover the cause. ‘We suspect that there was an oil leak from a petrol station not far from here.’ . However, Li Jianhua, the manager of the petrol station, refuted these claims, saying: ‘The authorities have already examined the place and nothing was wrong. . 'There has not been any problems with the well in the petrol station either.' Local government officials in Ansai say they have already started a specific investigation. .

But Judy Murray has already wasted no time in revealing she simply ‘can’t wait to be a granny’. However, the tennis coach, who helped propel Andy, 27, and his brother, Jamie, 29, to sporting success, has a couple of caveats – he has to get the French Open and Wimbledon out of the way first. Mrs Murray, 55, who has carved out her own star status after appearing on Strictly Come Dancing last year, also said she would be a ‘very active granny’ and in the same way she coached her sons, she already has plans to introduce her grandchildren to tennis. She told Closer magazine: ‘I’m really looking forward to being a granny. I’ve always wanted to have grandchildren but I had to be patient and let them get married first. ‘I’m not sure when they will have kids as Andy has the French Open followed by Wimbledon, but I know he wants them. I will be a very active granny, that’s for sure – and I can’t wait to introduce them to tennis.’.

And the women had a chance to confront the woman, named Kayla, on an episode of Dr Phil that aired on Friday. Scroll down for videos . Seven women who were all believed to be in an online relationship with the same man found out that they had been catfished by a 24-year-old woman in Texas named Kayla. Kayla apologized to the women, saying she was trying to figure out who she was because it's 'difficult' to be both gay and Mormon. 'Can I ask what triggered this in the first place and why you've done it for so long?' one of the women asked. Kayla responded by saying she tried to figure out her life in the 'wrong way'. . 'It's for the simple fact that being gay and being Mormon is hard,' Kayla said. 'Your church tells you, \"We love you, but we don't love who you are\".' In the episode she apologizes to the women, most of whom forgive her and say they would have been her friend in other circumstances. 'I'm sorry that I dragged you guys into my mess. Whether you believe me or not, that's up to you,' she said to the women. The women has spoken to the women for various amounts of time, ranging from a month to more than a year. . Kayla had taken the identity of a man named Keagan, who goes to school in Montana. He apologized to the women who all had been talking to a Kayla, who used Keagan's pictures online. The women's faces all looked disappointed and shocked when Kayla first walked through the door, revealing herself as the person they had all been talking to. The women mostly wanted to know why Kayla decided to pretend to be a man and why she had spoken to some of the women for longer than others. Kayla had stolen the identity of a Montana student named Keagan, who the women had a chance to meet on the Dr Phil segment. . He had no idea his identity had been stolen and apologized to the women for what had happened to them.  . One victim said that the man she thought she was talking to told her he loved her, while another said he became 'her perfect guy' and that it 'almost seemed too good to be true'. . It emerged that Kayla was a catfish - someone who tricks others online by setting up fake profiles with fake pictures and names- after one of the women became suspicious and looked into the man she had been talking to. Kayla told Dr Phil that she 'didn't have any evil intentions' and that she was just trying to figure herself out. 'I created an online persona so I could figure out who I was, and figure out if I was gay or not and figure out if I wanted to be part of the religion or not.' Kayla, who now says she is gay, said. She added: 'Do I want to be part of the church, or do I want to be gay? And unfortunately, I saw myself in a position where I couldn't have both... You don't understand how difficult that is.' Victim Hilary Hayes said she had been texted out of the blue by someone calling himself 'Hunter Anderson' who claimed to have seen her at a party and that he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The women appeared uncomfortable at times during the interview and some even rolled their eyes at what Kayla was saying. Most of the women, however, agreed to forgive Kayla for what she did. She told Fox13 that they would regularly text and talk and he even sent her flowers on Valentine's Day - but that Anderson would never agree to meet up. At the same time, another victim, Sara Vanwagenen, believed she was in a relationship with a man called 'Hyrum Young'. She too reported that the person they were in contact with would never agree to meet up. The pair eventually realised the texts they were receiving were from the same number and it turned out they had both been duped by a woman called Kayla, from Texas. . Vanwagenen is reported as saying: 'I let this person into my life in a really big way. I was really angry and really hurt.' Hayes added: 'She just knew everything about me it was just really hurtful to find out that you literally didn't know anything about this person, not even something so foundational as their name.' .

He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February. Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution.

    "document": "A Lithuanian gangster accused of two murders in his home country has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds in a deportation farce after claiming he was too depressed to leave Britain. Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his ‘manifestly ill-founded’ case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. . This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the £40,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: ‘This is a shocking example of Labour’s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.’. Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. . He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius’s claim that extradition breached his human rights was ‘inadmissible’. They added: ‘The court considers this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected.’ .",

    "document": "Universal's \"Furious 7\" is about to make history.\"Furious 7\" — the final film from the late Paul Walker — is expected to gross $115 million or more when opening at the North American box office this weekend, the top showing ever for an April title, not accounting for inflation.Domestically, it is getting the widest release in Universal's history with a theater count of roughly 4,003 (including Imax locations), eclipsing \"Despicable Me 2\" (3,956). Anything north of 4,000 is usually reserved for summer tentpoles and year-end titles. Overseas, the movie is also poised to do massive business, putting its global debut north of $250 million. \"Furious 7\" is opening day-and-date around the world on 10,500 screens in 63 territories, save for a few major markets including China, Russia and Japan. THR: 'Furious 7' scores Thailand release despite Tony Jaa contract dispute. The current record-holder for top April opening domestically is \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" which debuted to $95 million from 3,928 theaters last year. \"Furious 7\" is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date. And if it beats the $121.9 million launch of \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1\" in November 2014, it will mark the largest three-day opening since \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" ($158 million) in November 2013. The movie enjoys massive awareness and interest, due to both the popularity of the street-racing series and Walker's death. The last film,\" Fast & Furious 6,\" debuted to a franchise-best $117 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2012, including $97.4 million for the three days, on its way to grossing $788.7 million worldwide. Universal intended to open \"Furious 7\" on July 11, 2014, but production was halted in November 2013 when Walker died in a car crash during the Thanksgiving hiatus. After director James Wan, writer Chris Morgan and Universal pored over existing footage and tweaked the script, production resumed in April 2014. THR: Studio profitability report - Who's up and who's down. CGI and voice effects were used in some scenes featuring Walker's detective character, Brian O'Conner, with Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody, used as stand-ins. \"Furious 7\" pits Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto and crew (which includes Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson, among others, as well as Walker) against Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw, out for revenge after the death of his brother. \"Furious 7\" is expected to usher in a string of mega-openings at the box office this year. Disney and Marvel's \"The Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" set to open May 1, hasn't come on tracking yet, but some forecasters are already suggesting it could score the top opening of all time domestically, eclipsing the record-breaking start of \"The Avengers\" ($207 million) in 2012.
