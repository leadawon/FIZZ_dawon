U will always Live in Me. Rest in power.\"BBC radio presenter Gilles Peterson wrote: \"Apart from Lennon and McCartney no one from the UK has written more gold plated songs than Sir Rod Temperton... a huge loss.

I would rather go in with the SDLP.\"Mr Nesbitt went on to say that, on Monday, he spent a lot of time time knocking doors in heavily unionist areas with \"very little criticism and a lot of support for what I was talking about\".\"I am confident in my position and I'm very confident and relaxed that [candidates] behind me are taking different positions in terms of vote transfer,\" he said.\"But people will come back on 2 March to thinking about the £85,000 a day that is going up in smoke, the 10 years of the DUP and Sin Féin in that castle and the impossibility, no matter what anybody writes in a platform piece for the newspaper, of leopards changing their spots.\"The manifesto, entitled 'Real Partnership', includes calls for action in tackling waiting lists, increasing PSNI numbers to 7,500, prioritising the York Street interchange, standing up for the LGBT community and \"guaranteeing\" that no group is worse off because of Brexit.In a section entitled 'Cleaning Up Stormont', the party calls for:On the theme of the election being a referendum, he said it was about \"incompetence, arrogance, cronyism and the strong whiff of corruption\".He must hope that message will resonate more strongly than the continuing controversy over his remarks about transferring to the SDLP.",

Yes,\" he was once quoted as saying.And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.\"Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,\" he said.During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work \"any monkey\" could do.The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.\"I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,\" he said of the synthetic microbes.\"If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.\"",

What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.\"I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,\" he said of the synthetic microbes.\"If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.\"",

The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels.No more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says.Sir Peter said: \"Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees.\"Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place.

The Conference bent over backwards to help them.\"I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking.\"It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves.\"You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.\"The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June.The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to £148,000.That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June.But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted.The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010.They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up.By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane.26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for £1 and clear their £220,000 debts22 May -  Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June10 June - Hereford expelled from Football ConferenceAnd former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary.When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000.They still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).An offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for £1 and take over the running at Edgar Street.But, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option.Keyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover.The downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates.The average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,758, little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,270 in League Two just five years ago.",

It was like living in a different world, not like living on earth.They used a blade to cut the letters RUF into my chest, so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government.The rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee, and I saw this happen to other people.Sometimes they would even take out the heart from someone's chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it.It seems like a nightmare now.I remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over.If they said: \"We don't have food\", we told them they were lying, and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth.Sometimes we were forced to kill, which we did under the influence of drugs: Marijuana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available.I was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks.Luckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital, Freetown, but was unable to find my relatives.I lived alone, but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick-pocketing and I was caught.Fortunately [while in jail] I met a preacher called Richard Cole, who was the founder of a project called Lifeline Nehemiah which aimed to give hope, and a home, to people like me who felt they had lost hope.He encouraged me saying: \"You used to cause atrocities, but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation.\"At the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling, he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it.Richard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times, and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me.He passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it.When the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy.We were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases.Through this so many lives were saved.There were three key activities.We started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real. So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence.We educated more than 10,000 people, and explained the message in their languages - Temne, Krio and Limba.Secondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items. This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas.Thirdly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives.People were frightened.Sometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them.It was scary and some people said it was witchcraft, but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves.One of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us.There were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous.When I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad, I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic.We didn't have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community, and that was how it started.Now I see my life as a changed person.I regret all that I did, but I am confident now that the future is great.We are investing in young people; I believe young people have a role in changing the world, not only Sierra Leone but the world.If we invest in them then we are building the future.11,314Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)4,808 Liberia3,955 Sierra Leone2,536 Guinea8 Nigeria",

It was like living in a different world, not like living on earth.They used a blade to cut the letters RUF into my chest, so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government.The rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee, and I saw this happen to other people.Sometimes they would even take out the heart from someone's chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it.It seems like a nightmare now.I remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over.If they said: \"We don't have food\", we told them they were lying, and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth.Sometimes we were forced to kill, which we did under the influence of drugs: Marijuana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available.I was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks.Luckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital, Freetown, but was unable to find my relatives.I lived alone, but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick-pocketing and I was caught.Fortunately [while in jail] I met a preacher called Richard Cole, who was the founder of a project called Lifeline Nehemiah which aimed to give hope, and a home, to people like me who felt they had lost hope.He encouraged me saying: \"You used to cause atrocities, but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation.\"At the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling, he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it.Richard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times, and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me.He passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it.When the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy.We were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases.Through this so many lives were saved.There were three key activities.We started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real. So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence.We educated more than 10,000 people, and explained the message in their languages - Temne, Krio and Limba.Secondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items. This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas.Thirdly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives.People were frightened.Sometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them.It was scary and some people said it was witchcraft, but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves.One of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us.There were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous.When I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad, I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic.We didn't have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community, and that was how it started.Now I see my life as a changed person.I regret all that I did, but I am confident now that the future is great.We are investing in young people; I believe young people have a role in changing the world, not only Sierra Leone but the world.If we invest in them then we are building the future.11,314Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)4,808 Liberia3,955 Sierra Leone2,536 Guinea8 Nigeria",

This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.\"To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,\" he said about whether he would extend his stay.\"No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.\"Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.\"Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of \"tension\" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete.

The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.Why Jonathan lost?Buhari's historic victoryNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.",

The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.Why Jonathan lost?Buhari's historic victoryNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.",

If I had known, I could have rationalised it but at the time I felt embarrassed.\"I started thinking 'maybe it is me, maybe I'm doing something wrong.'\"On Monday, the watchdog published 21 reports into schools allegedly targeted as part of a hardline Muslim takeover.Five of those schools, including Park View and Oldknow, were rated inadequate.'Islamic-themed assemblies'Birmingham City Council said it would work with Saltley School, the only local authority school placed in special measures, and the Department for Education to install a temporary governing board.In a letter to Park View chairman Tahir Alam, education minister Lord Nash said there were \"deep concerns\" about the way Park View School was run.The letter said: \"I have decided under clause 5.6 of the supplementary funding agreement for the academy to give written notice of the Secretary of State's intention to terminate that agreement.\"Lord Nash criticised the trust for failing to promote \"spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils\".\"I am deeply mindful of the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations,\" he said.A similar letter about Nansen Primary School, also addressed to Tahir Alam, said it would have its funding arrangement terminated.Both letters invited the trust to respond before 4 July.A spokesman for Park View School said they would challenge the Ofsted report through the appropriate legal channels.They said terminating the funding agreement would mean the trust could be removed from the running of the three schools.\"What happens to the schools after that would be the decision of the secretary of state, as they are already academy schools under the remit of [the] Department for Education,\" they said.In a letter to Dr Achmad da Costa, chair of Oldknow Academy Trust, Lord Nash said it was not meeting the requirements set out in its funding agreement.\"Therefore the Secretary of State is minded to terminate the funding agreement unless all the breaches are addressed promptly, in full, and to his satisfaction,\" it said.Lord Nash set out a list of actions the trust must take before 4 July.These included ending \"less favourable\" treatment of non-Muslims, ceasing segregation of boys and girls, and drawing up a plan to ensure a more \"broad and balanced\" curriculum.Oldknow Academy declined to comment on the letter from Lord Nash.A letter to Tahir Alam regarding Golden Hillock's funding arrangement set out a similar list of demands to be completed within the same timescale.Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said \"a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip\" in Birmingham schools, while a number of head teachers had reported an \"organised campaign to target certain schools in order to impose a narrow, faith-based ideology\".'Own agendas'The report into Park View School said the academy's work to keep students safe, including from extremism, was inadequate.It said external speakers had not been vetted properly and the school had allowed a guest with known extremist views to speak to students as part of Islamic-themed assemblies.Park View and Oldknow trusts did not comment on the future but one of Saltley School's senior teachers said it hoped to boost its Ofsted rating.Darren Turner was brought in as associate head teacher on Thursday as part of a partnership scheme with other local schools.He said there had been \"upset\" among staff and pupils at Saltley's inadequate rating.\"This is all about moving forward, what happens next,\" he said.\"Behind these walls they've got some excellent teachers and they want to get back to doing what they are good at: teaching.\"When this school gets back to 'good' again we want to go further and become outstanding.\"Parents at the schools have criticised Ofsted's reports and accused inspectors of bias.Health professional Arshad Malik told the BBC the findings were  \"alien\" to his child's experience at Park View.\"‎Inspectors came with loaded questions,\" he said.\"People are trying to use this school to push their own agendas.\"He said parents would like to invite Education Secretary Michael Gove to the school for an open meeting about Ofsted's findings and to talk about what evidence was found to support them.",

Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference.\"Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little.Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall.\"It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,\" she recalled. \"There were thousands of people cheering when we came out.\"We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated.\"I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background.

The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass.\"Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began.The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead.Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (£675,000) to $50,000 (£34,000).Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over.\"I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems,\" FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport.Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty.The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared.The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup.Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.\"We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence,\" said Snoussi.\"But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium.\"\"But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. \"We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected.\"In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match.\"Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement.\"Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,\" said Snoussi.\"We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out.\"Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.",

With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races.They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99.Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'.They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari.But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information.There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan.Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline.Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970.Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda.But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now.So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another.Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season.So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again?Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return.It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title.This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007.The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end.Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too.They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver \"championships, plural\", as Dennis puts it.But right now, belief is all they have.

There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: \"Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.\"It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.\"The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: \"The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.\"Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.\"Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).\"The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.\"",

Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx.\"The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media.Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd.The teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond.The Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell.On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell.Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson.The teenager wrote on his page: \"I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again.\"I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving.\"Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along.

Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct.\"We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier,\" explained Ms Gardent.\"Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there.  Also, deep shadows can hide the glacier margins.\"The only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory. It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km.By 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows.Since then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s.This represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif.\"The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps,\" Ms Gardent emphasised.\"We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud.\"The northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.  Its area today is just over 30 sq km, a shade smaller than the 31.5 sq km in the late 1960s/early 1970s.Efforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region.At this very meeting three years ago, Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk",

It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km.By 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows.Since then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s.This represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif.\"The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps,\" Ms Gardent emphasised.\"We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud.\"The northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.  Its area today is just over 30 sq km, a shade smaller than the 31.5 sq km in the late 1960s/early 1970s.Efforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region.At this very meeting three years ago, Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk",

But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale.

In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name.

Scroll down for video In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale.

        "document": "The Indiana Pacers' Chris Copeland and his wife were stabbed during an early-morning argument after they left a popular New York club  on Wednesday, according to reports. Copeland, 31, and his wife, Katrine Saltare, 28, were talking in the street just before 4am when a 22-year-old man, Shezoy Bleary, interrupted them,  the New York Post reported. When Copeland, who used to play for the New York Knicks, told the man to back off, the suspect allegedly pulled out a knife and plunged it into the athlete's abdomen and elbow. He then turned on Saltare, stabbing her in the breast, buttocks and arm, sources told the Post. Scroll down for video Injured: Chris Copeland, a player for the Indiana Pacers, and his wife, Katrine Saltare, pictured, were both stabbed following an argument outside a New York City club early on Wednesday Cuffed: Pero Antic, who plays for the Atlanta Hawks, was arrested for failing to clear the scene for police and he is seen being escorted out of the 10th Precinct of the NYPD on Wednesday Arrest: Another Hawks player, Thabo Sefolosha, was also arrested and can be seen leaving the station A video shared with TMZ shows the victims on the sidewalk as they are attended to by emergency responders. 'We were both stabbed,' Saltare can be heard saying. 'We were attacked out of nowhere by a f***ing black civilian. We have nothing to say. We are scared for our lives!' Another woman, Catherine Somani, 23, was also stabbed in the abdomen as she apparently tried to break up the fight, WABC reported. She knew the attacker. Murdock, from Brooklyn, was arrested at the scene along with two fellow NBA players, Pero Antić and Thabo Sefolosha of the Atlanta Hawks. The players allegedly obstructed the crime scene as police arrived by refusing to get out of the way, according to sources. Authorities recovered a knife from the scene, sources told the New York Daily News. Copeland and his wife were both listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital, while Somani was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital. Their injuries are not thought to be life threatening. Injured: Video by a passerby shows Copeland and his wife on the ground before they were taken to hospital Scene: The couple was stabbed by a man who interrupted them as they argued outside 1OAK in Chelsea Bloody scene: After Copeland reportedly told the man to back off, he pulled out a knife and stabbed them Blood-splattered: A nearby car, which belongs to Copeland, has streaks of blood across it after the attack Probe: NYPD officers search for evidence outside the 1Oak nightclub in Chelsea in New York City CBS reported that Copeland underwent surgery on Wednesday morning. 'We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City,' Indiana Pacers President Larry Bird said in a statement to DailyMail.com on Wednesday. 'We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured.' The team confirmed that he had suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen. The fight broke out down the street from 1OAK, a popular Chelsea club where celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and Lindsay Lohan have been spotted partying. The couple is believed to have only been inside the club briefly. The Hawks and Pacers are both in New York for basketball games. Together: The couple, pictured, was rushed to Bellevue hospital where they are in stable condition Loved up: The couple are seen in a picture taken after their engagement in September 2013 Copeland, who is from New Jersey, was supposed to play his former team, the New York Knicks, at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. He previously played 56 games for the team in his 2012-2013 rookie season. Both Pacers and Knicks fans flocked to social media to wish him a speedy recovery on Wednesday.

The players allegedly obstructed the crime scene as police arrived by refusing to get out of the way, according to sources. Authorities recovered a knife from the scene, sources told the New York Daily News. Copeland and his wife were both listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital, while Somani was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital. Their injuries are not thought to be life threatening. Injured: Video by a passerby shows Copeland and his wife on the ground before they were taken to hospital Scene: The couple was stabbed by a man who interrupted them as they argued outside 1OAK in Chelsea Bloody scene: After Copeland reportedly told the man to back off, he pulled out a knife and stabbed them Blood-splattered: A nearby car, which belongs to Copeland, has streaks of blood across it after the attack Probe: NYPD officers search for evidence outside the 1Oak nightclub in Chelsea in New York City CBS reported that Copeland underwent surgery on Wednesday morning. 'We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City,' Indiana Pacers President Larry Bird said in a statement to DailyMail.com on Wednesday. 'We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured.' The team confirmed that he had suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen.

He previously played 56 games for the team in his 2012-2013 rookie season. Both Pacers and Knicks fans flocked to social media to wish him a speedy recovery on Wednesday. 'Hope that you and your wife have a speedy recovery,' one fan wrote. 'Once a knick always a knick.' The Hawks will take on the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center, but it is not yet clear if the two arrested players will be available to play. 'We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning,' Hawks spokesperson Garin Narain told DailyMail.com on Wednesday.

His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory – or a loss – could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that. 'We had a good football match last weekend (2-1 defeat at home to Arsenal) and got nothing for it. At the end of the day, it's all about getting the win.'

        "document": "They are the peculiar concrete markings that have been spotted all across America, prompting hikers and travellers to wonder what on Earth they could mean and where they are pointing to. But these giant arrows, which can measure up to 70ft in length, are actually a forgotten remnant of a bygone age. Dotted among scrubland, placed in seemingly random spots, these huge arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the US - forming the first land-based navigation system in the world. A huge concrete arrow is found in perfect condition in Bloomington, Washington County, Utah The Bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith, who have travelled across the US to photograph the monuments The concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways, showing pilots the direction they needed to fly in to reach the next stop-off to deliver mail. Airmail in the US began as early as 1911, with the first official flight departing Petaluma, California, and arriving in Santa Rosa, California. As the flights got longer, with more frequent stop-offs, so the beacons and arrows were placed to help pilots on their way. Following World War One, the US Postal Service began to use surplus war planes for mail delivery and many were flown by former army pilots. The arrows define a moment in history at the beginning of the 21st century when the US Postal service began delivering air mail Perfectly set against the snow-capped mountains of Nevada, this arrow was photographed in Golconda, Humboldt County Captured near the tiny town of Medicine Bow in Wyoming, this beacon was on the famous New York to San Francisco route One of the most important flight routes and the first to be completed, stretched across the US from New York to San Francisco The giant arrows started to be placed across the country, sometimes at 10-mile intervals, from 1924. Painted bright yellow and placed alongside beacon with a gas light at the top, the idea was that the markers could be seen for a distance of up to 10 miles so pilots could find their way. In the summer of 1924, they stretched from Wyoming to Ohio and by the following year, the arrows had reached New York. By 1929, the arrows could direct flights all the way across the width of America. The main New York to San Francisco air route stretched from New York to San Francisco, following the yellow concrete trail. Medicine Bow town in Carbon County has a population of just 284 and was originally established due to the construction of a transcontinental railroad Not all the arrows are in good condition, with each passing winter more cracks appear in the concrete, such as with this arrow in Mote, Nevada Pumpernickle n Nevada has its own concrete arrow too, which one again is overlooked by the state's beautiful mountains In the days before radio and satellite communications, the arrows were a way to ensure pilots could find their way, even in poor weather. While the arrows are now long-forgotten, with many lost forever, there are fans who, having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside, have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind. Retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith were sent an email which piqued their interest and have been hunting down the arrows ever since. The email playfully explained: 'Every so often, usually in the vast deserts of the American Southwest, a hiker or a backpacker will run across something puzzling: a large concrete arrow, as much as seventy feet in length, sitting in the middle of scrub-covered nowhere.' The couple say they have found 102 arrows so far and have set up their website Arrows Across America as part of their photography site dreamsmithphotos.com so fellow fans can share their own pictures and help map where the remaining arrows are. The Smiths told MailOnline Travel: 'We have located 102 arrows or portions of arrows, some are badly deteriorated and not much is left. Arrowheads and ancient earth mounds have been discovered at Poverty Point, in Utah, but it also has a more recent concrete arrow A beacon has survived in good condition in New Mexico (left) and at Cottage Grove in Oregon (right) - many of these were lost as the metal was used in the war effort during the Second World War At Thayer Juntion, in Wyoming, there are boards that supply information about the arrows and their use to passers-by 'Our interest grew out of an email circulating in August 2013, we wanted to know where they were, and set out to find them. 'We have managed to take photos of approximately 40, and have a trip planned this fall to take more photos of some that we were unable to get to last spring. 'Eventually we hope to have photos of all the arrows that we have located, but time and money will dictate how long that will take us. 'Before our research we knew nothing about airways, beacons or concrete arrows, it has been a marvelous journey of discovery and we cannot believe that all of this has been \"forgotten.\"'.",

Painted bright yellow and placed alongside beacon with a gas light at the top, the idea was that the markers could be seen for a distance of up to 10 miles so pilots could find their way.

While the arrows are now long-forgotten, with many lost forever, there are fans who, having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside, have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind. Retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith were sent an email which piqued their interest and have been hunting down the arrows ever since. The email playfully explained: 'Every so often, usually in the vast deserts of the American Southwest, a hiker or a backpacker will run across something puzzling: a large concrete arrow, as much as seventy feet in length, sitting in the middle of scrub-covered nowhere.' The couple say they have found 102 arrows so far and have set up their website Arrows Across America as part of their photography site dreamsmithphotos.com so fellow fans can share their own pictures and help map where the remaining arrows are. The Smiths told MailOnline Travel: 'We have located 102 arrows or portions of arrows, some are badly deteriorated and not much is left. Arrowheads and ancient earth mounds have been discovered at Poverty Point, in Utah, but it also has a more recent concrete arrow A beacon has survived in good condition in New Mexico (left) and at Cottage Grove in Oregon (right) - many of these were lost as the metal was used in the war effort during the Second World War At Thayer Juntion, in Wyoming, there are boards that supply information about the arrows and their use to passers-by 'Our interest grew out of an email circulating in August 2013, we wanted to know where they were, and set out to find them. 'We have managed to take photos of approximately 40, and have a trip planned this fall to take more photos of some that we were unable to get to last spring. 'Eventually we hope to have photos of all the arrows that we have located, but time and money will dictate how long that will take us. 'Before our research we knew nothing about airways, beacons or concrete arrows, it has been a marvelous journey of discovery and we cannot believe that all of this has been \"forgotten.\"'.",

        "document": "Wanted: Police in Maryland have issued a warrant for the arrest of 26-year-old karate instructor Alexander Soumbadze who has been charged with eight counts of child pornography Police in Maryland have launched a manhunt for a 26-year-old karate instructor who has been charged with possessing child pornography. The Montgomery County Police Department said Friday that Alexander Soumbadze faces eight possession of child pornography counts. Soumbadze has recently admitted to trading and receiving child pornography, after which police say the Georgian national fled the country. An investigation also uncovered videos of the martial arts expert inappropriately touching and engaging in sexual acts with adolescent males at a Maryland karate studio where he was co-owner and instructor. Officials say the videos were taken before October 2011 and that they are attempting to locate victims to determine possible additional charges. According to Montgomery County police, the 26-year-old, a native of Tbilisi, Georgia, fled the US after confessing to the crimes. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of the Bethesda resident. According to a press release put out by the Montgomery County police Friday, in December 2014, the agency was tipped off by colleagues in South Dakota that a Maryland resident was uploading child pornography.

        "document": "People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13% higher than a colleague The cost of divorce can wreck retirement many years after the break-up of a marriage, according to research. People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce. It means an extra £2,100 a year – £17,800 rather than £15,700 – to anyone who has kept their marriage intact, or who has never married, according to the survey for the Prudential. It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles. The debt of a divorced retiree averages £22,100, Prudential’s report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers. Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that £9,500 – the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday’s report said. The impact of divorce on a former spouse’s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working. The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up. Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health. The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult, studies suggests The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands, wives and children suffer during a divorce – usually including loss of income, the price of running two homes instead of one, legal costs, and the long-term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse – does not fade away even as old age approaches. Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children, a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through ‘pension-splitting’ arrangements. One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles, according to research Prudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat said: ‘Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement. ‘A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple will have to split in the event of a divorce. Professional advice is particularly important in the face of the recent changes to pensions legislation and divorced retirees acting on advice received under the previous rules may want to consider seeking updated advice on any post-retirement plans they have made. ‘During a divorce the costs can quickly mount up, with legal fees, the cost of setting up a new home and the effect of splitting any existing retirement savings all potentially impacting the ability of those involved to continue saving into a pension. Unfortunately divorce is most likely among those aged 40 to 44, the period in many people’s lives when earning potential peaks and the most valuable pension contributions can be made.’ The findings were based on a survey carried out by Research Pluse among 7,687 people aged over 45, who included 1,012 people intending to retire this year.",

One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles, according to research Prudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat said: ‘Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement. ‘A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple will have to split in the event of a divorce. Professional advice is particularly important in the face of the recent changes to pensions legislation and divorced retirees acting on advice received under the previous rules may want to consider seeking updated advice on any post-retirement plans they have made. ‘During a divorce the costs can quickly mount up, with legal fees, the cost of setting up a new home and the effect of splitting any existing retirement savings all potentially impacting the ability of those involved to continue saving into a pension. Unfortunately divorce is most likely among those aged 40 to 44, the period in many people’s lives when earning potential peaks and the most valuable pension contributions can be made.’ The findings were based on a survey carried out by Research Pluse among 7,687 people aged over 45, who included 1,012 people intending to retire this year.",

        "document": "People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13% higher than a colleague The cost of divorce can wreck retirement many years after the break-up of a marriage, according to research. People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce. It means an extra £2,100 a year – £17,800 rather than £15,700 – to anyone who has kept their marriage intact, or who has never married, according to the survey for the Prudential. It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles. The debt of a divorced retiree averages £22,100, Prudential’s report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers. Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that £9,500 – the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday’s report said. The impact of divorce on a former spouse’s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working. The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up. Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health.

        "document": "Gary Locke will be confirmed as Kilmarnock’s permanent manager on Friday - exactly eight weeks after he was asked to take charge until the end of the season. An announcement will be made by the Rugby Park club on Friday morning, with the former Hearts boss being given a three-year deal. And on Thursday the 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since he replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February. Kilmarnock will confirm Gary Locke as the club's new permanent manager on Friday ‘I’d be over the moon to get it as it’s something I’ve worked hard towards,’ said Locke while negotiations were being finalised at the Ayrshire club. ‘I had a taste of it (management) at Hearts and really enjoyed it. I’m fortunate I was put into this position at a great club. It’s a fantastic opportunity. ‘But I’ve said all along, it’s not about me. It’s about players. If they perform, you get a better reputation as a manager and that has been the case here with a great response from them. ‘That’s how football works. If they play well, your stock rises. Equally, if they don’t play well, it’s the manager who gets the stick. ‘I’ve got broad shoulders and I know what to expect but I can’t praise the players highly enough. They have worked so hard and they have taken on board everything I have tried to tell them.’ Ex-Killie and Hearts player Locke, who was crestfallen not to be retained by the Tynecastle club as head coach after they were relegated last season, added: ‘(Coaches) Alan Robertson and Billy Thomson have done a fantastic job in helping me, too. ‘You can’t do all of these things by yourself and backroom staff can be as important as the players. I can’t thank all of these people enough.’ Locke, who returned to Rugby Park last summer, had been working as No 2 under Johnston when the manager announced in February that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season, indicating that the £150,000 sale of teenage forward Robbie Muirhead to Dundee United had been a factor in his decision. After Johnston was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy, assistant Locke was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop-gap appointment. But he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship. They only suffered their first reverse under Locke when Ross County beat them 2-1 in Dingwall two weeks ago. Kilmarnock went unbeaten during Locke's first six games in charge of the club He has impressed Mann not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm. Kilmarnock are currently eighth in the Premiership and still remain in the hunt for a top-six place. It was expected that Locke would have been appointed permanently before now, but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top-six finish this season. ‘When you are dealing with contracts, they take a bit of time and I certainly don’t foresee any problems,’ he said. ‘There hasn’t really been a hold-up. As any player or manager will tell you, when it comes to the terms of a contract, it doesn’t just happen overnight. There are a lot of things to discuss and I have done that. ‘I will keep all that private because that is the way it should be and the club have dealt with it brilliantly. ‘I’ve no complaints there, so I hope it will be sorted before Saturday and I can concentrate on our home game against Motherwell. ‘Our new board of directors have been fantastic. I’ve been really impressed with the way that they have handled everything. The club itself is trying to be as positive as possible. ‘There are a lot of plans in place to make the club even better than it is right now, so there are loads of positives and I would like to be part of that.’ Having resolved his own situation, Locke will next week turn his attention to the futures of nine first-team players at Kilmarnock — Manuel Pascali, Alexei Eremenko, Craig Slater, Craig Samson, Sammy Clingan, Greg Kiltie, Conor Brennan, Chris Chantler and Mark O’Hara — who will become free agents this summer. ‘I’ve said for a number of weeks now that once my own position was sorted out, there are a few players out of contract and they will want to know what their futures are,’ he said. ‘So it will be great to get moving on all of that and prepare for next season. ‘You can’t do that until you are the main man.’",

        "document": "A new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis. The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Scroll down for video The white-cheeked macaque, from Tibet, China, has a distinctive rounded penis compared to other macaques Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in Tibet. Human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis, but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom. An evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species. He concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners, or even as a way of cooling the body down. The relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe in his latest 'How Did We Get Here?' video series for the University of New South Wales, Australia. Gorillas have small penises and small testicles, while chimps have medium-sized penises and large testicles. By comparison, human males have the longest penis and medium-sized testicles. 'Amazingly the size of the reproductive organs, especially the testicles, are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially,' explained Professor Curnoe. 'Why the difference? Well for the testicles it's pretty straight forward. 'It all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps, and their sperm, have when they mate with females.' But he said there wasn't a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. He said: 'Medog County is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science. 'Furthermore, it locates in southeastern Tibet and close to McMahon line which is a political sensitive area. Very few have people studied primates there. 'This species has long been identified as Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) because no clear photos or good specimens are available.' In an attempt to better study the animals living in the region, Cheng Li, a photographer with the Imaging Biodiversity Expedition in Beijing, set up camera traps in the area's remote tropical and evergreen mountain forests. They captured 685 photos of macaques and Mr Li was also able to follow a group of macaques allowing him to obtain close up images. When the researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, examined the images they started to notice some monkeys that had different features. They the animals hd relatively short hairless tails and almost white hairs around their face. They also had long thick hairs on their neck. But the most distinctive feature was the creatures genitalia. Most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises. However, Macaca leucogenys had far more rounded penis and a dark hairy scrotum. Scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails (like those above) and light coloured markings around their face, leading them to identify a new species of primate The images above show the more usual 'arrow-shaped' genitalia that macaques in the area have Videos also revealed that Macaca leucogenys produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by Macaca assamensis as an alarm call. Dr Fan said the species seemed to inhabit a diverse range of habitats and was found living in tropical forests at 1,395 metres, evergreen broad-leaved forests at 2,400 metres and a mixed broad leaf and conifer forest at 2,700 metres. However, the researchers, who also included Choa Zhao from the Southwest Forestry University in Kunming, China, warned that the new species may be under threat. They said: 'The white-cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations. The white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of Medog in south east Tibet, China The researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of Macaca leucogenys become paler and more prominent with age. Infants can be seen in the images A and B while a juvenile is labelled C. Adult females are in the image D and adult males are seen on the far right of image E. Adults have few dark hairs on their faces 'Discovery of this new primate species further highlights the high value for biodiversity conservation of southeastern Tibet and calls for more intensive surveys, studies, and environmental protection in this area.' Dr Fan added that it was possible there could be other species of primate still to be discovered in the area. He said: 'This area has been little studied. 'Although primates have been intensively studied for decades, two new macaque species (Macaca munzala and M. leucogenys) were discovered and described in this area in the past 10 years. 'As for other species groups that received less attention, We believe there are still some species remain undiscovered. 'It is highly possible that some primate species still remain undiscovered.'

Al-Douri, 72, headed the Naqshbandi Order insurgent group, an important faction behind the recent rise of ISIS. Scroll down for video Al-Douri was an Iraqi military commander and was Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council, until the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the famous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse He was one of Saddam's most trusted henchmen, helping to lead his 1968 bloodless coup. Both Al-Douri and Saddam came from the same Tikriti tribal background. He was then deputy to Saddam when he was deposed following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December, 2006, Al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Ba'ath Party. Al-Douri was deemed the most high-profile official of Saddam's Ba'ath Party to evade capture after the invasion. He was ranked sixth on the US military's list of the 55 most-wanted Iraqis after offensive to overthrow Saddam and had a $10m bounty on his head. He was the King of Clubs in the infamous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse. His dead body was pictured on social media today with his teeth missing, an unkempt orange beard and a bloody head wound. Salahuddin governor Raed al-Jabouri said soldiers and allied Shia militiamen killed him in an operation east of Tikrit - a city that was recaptured by the government two weeks ago. He said: 'This is a major victory for those involved in the operation. He is considered a mastermind for this terrorist group. 'For sure this will have an impact on them...there will be a break among them.' ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. However, in recent months Iraqi forces, supported by US-led air strikes, have captured large areas from the terrorist group. But today, a car bomb killed three people outside the U.S. consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region that is allied with Washington in a war against Islamic State, which claimed the attack. No U.S. personnel were hurt in the blast, according to the State Department which said a 'vehicle-borne improvised explosive device' exploded right outside the entrance to the heavily fortified compound. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for two car bombings in Baghdad that killed at least 27 people on Friday. 'The fighters of the Islamic State detonated two car bombs in the heart of the Iraqi capital this evening and a third in Erbil,' the group said via its news agency. Such attacks are relatively rare in Kurdistan, which has managed to insulate itself from the worst of the violence afflicting the rest of Iraq. A car bomb killed three people outside the U.S. consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region, today Kurdish security forces respond to an explosion at the pedestrian entrance to the U.S. Consulate complex In the invasion of Iraq by a US-led coalition, the military developed a set of playing cards to help troops identify the most-wanted members of Saddam's regime. This was mostly high-ranking members of the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party or members of the Revolutionary Command Council. The cards were officially named the 'personality identification playing cards'. Each card contained the wanted person's address and, if available, the job they carried out. The highest-ranking cards, starting with the aces and kings, were used for the people at the top of the most-wanted list. Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the pack of cards.",

        "document": "(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the \"power of the press\" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and \"the return of class\" -- who express views like, \"Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies. At least Britt McHenry owns up to it.",

        "document": "(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the \"power of the press\" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and \"the return of class\" -- who express views like, \"Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies. At least Britt McHenry owns up to it.",

In fact, six of Herrera's seven goals have been scored without him even having to glimpse at either the ball or the opposition's net. Manchester United star Ander Herrera scores his side's opening goal against Aston Villa with his eyes shut The Spanish midfielder appears to have his eyes closed as he strikes at Brad Guzan's goal Aston Villa and England midfielder Fabian Delph attempts to block Herrera's left-footed shot His eyes were wide open when he struck an impressive first-time shot against Yeovil in the third round of the FA Cup back in January. However his double against Aston Villa and his goals against Queens Park Rangers, Leicester, Preston and Swansea all came without Manchester United's summer signing having to make eye contact with the ball. Herrera appears to have a history of shooting with his eyes closed as the image of his goal for Spain's Under 20 side back in 2009 shows. Herrera hits the back of the net while representing Spain's Under 20 side against Tahiti The former Athletic Bilbao joined the Red Devils for £29million in the summer due to his vision and creativity in midfield. Louis van Gaal heaped praise on the 25-year-old's shooting ability after Saturday's Premier League encounter at Old Trafford, by stating: 'He has a very good kicking technique and he should be more composed,' Van Gaal said to MUTV. 'I said to him 'you have to control the ball before you shoot'. 'I said that to him again in yesterday's training session, and then I kissed him at half-time because he had controlled the ball for the first time in his life and then he shot.' Herrera's eyes were also shut for Manchester United's third goal against Aston Villa on Saturday His only Manchester United goal scored with his eyes wide open came against Yeovil Town back in January Herrera scored in Manchester United's 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers without looking at the ball The former Athletic Bilbao man flicked the ball past Preston's players without having his eyes on the ball Herrera scored in Manchester United's 2-1 defeat by Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium in February He also netted in Manchester United's shock 5-3 defeat at the hands of Premier League strugglers Leicester",

Authorities only cottoned on after she said her 2010 marriage to Salle Keita, of Mali, -  the tenth time she tied the knot - was actually her first, the New York Post reported.

Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury as Bayer crashed out of the Germany's DFB-Pokal at the quarter-final stage, losing 5-3 on penalties after 120 goalless minutes at the BayArena. But amateur footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch, where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff who were believed to have stopped his friends from walking between the stadium's West and East stands. Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after appearing to fight with stewards After initially being restrained (first photo), Spahic became involved in a clash with staff after the game Spahic later seemed to aim a headbutt at a member of stadium staff, even after the angry clash had died down Spahic is pictured taking on Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm for the ball during the DFB-Pokal quarter-final The incident has been referred to the public prosecutor in Cologne and could now be investigated by police.  Spahic will issue an apology for his behaviour. A Bayer spokesman said: 'It is clear that there has been a physical dispute after the final whistle. We will review the incident and try to clarify now who was there and why they were there.' In the video Spahic, wearing a red club top, is at first restrained by two stewards as members of his group clash with the stadium staff. Spahic is seen breaking away from the clutches of two stewards to assist his friends in the melee Footage shows Spahic seeming to throw his hands into the faces of some of the yellow-jacketed staff After breaking free, the 34-year-old joins the melee and appears to throw his hands into the faces of multiple stewards before aiming a headbutt at another even when the brawl dies down. Spahic is expected to miss his side's trip to face Mainz in the Bundesliga on Saturday through injury but he could be in line for a longer spell on the sidelines if action is taken after the incident on Wednesday night. Bayer are fourth in the Bundesliga, two points behind Borussia Monchengladbach in the race for a Champions League place and trailing runaway leaders Bayern by 19 points. Spahic tackles Muller on Wednesday, and he has been one of Bayer's star performers so far this season The Bosnian midfielder also appeared for his country during the recently international break against Austria",

        "document": "Birmingham is the rat capital of the UK and the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs, according to new research. The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. Scroll down for video A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_ While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland. The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.' Wasp numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years (left) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country (right) The number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in Scotland in the last five years, data showed, with those in Fife most likely to report a problem",

        "document": "A Hollywood-inspired experiment to help dementia patients by waking them up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place in New York. The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'",

She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'",

        "document": "A Hollywood-inspired experiment to help dementia patients by waking them up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place in New York. The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.'

        "document": "(CNN)\"A long, long, time ago...\" Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece \"American Pie.\"  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled.  \"Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\"  By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\"   When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when \"American Pie\" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing \"American Pie\" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing \"and they were singing\" everybody spontaneously joins in with the \"Bye, Bye\" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes \"American Pie\" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When \"American Pie\" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like \"Danny Boy\" or \"Streets of Laredo\" or \"Shenandoah,\" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, \"American Pie\" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret \"American Pie,\" it's fair to surmise that \"the king\" is Elvis Presley, \"Helter Skelter\" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the \"jester on the sidelines in a cast\" is Bob Dylan, and \"Jack Flash\" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to \"American Pie.\" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose \"American Pie\" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were \"Over the Rainbow\" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y \"Yip\" Harburg), \"White Christmas \"(by Irving Berlin), \"This Land is Your Land\" (by Woody Guthrie) and \"Respect\" (by Otis Redding).

McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled.  \"Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\"  By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\"   When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when \"American Pie\" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing \"American Pie\" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing \"and they were singing\" everybody spontaneously joins in with the \"Bye, Bye\" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes \"American Pie\" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When \"American Pie\" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like \"Danny Boy\" or \"Streets of Laredo\" or \"Shenandoah,\" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, \"American Pie\" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret \"American Pie,\" it's fair to surmise that \"the king\" is Elvis Presley, \"Helter Skelter\" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the \"jester on the sidelines in a cast\" is Bob Dylan, and \"Jack Flash\" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to \"American Pie.\" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose \"American Pie\" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were \"Over the Rainbow\" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y \"Yip\" Harburg), \"White Christmas \"(by Irving Berlin), \"This Land is Your Land\" (by Woody Guthrie) and \"Respect\" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, \"American Pie\" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.",

The Premier League champions have written to 300 fans who took them up on their offer of free transport for the Bank Holiday evening clash at Selhurst Park. Palace's South London home is notoriously difficult to get to and the club acted after the game was scheduled for an 8pm start, making it impossible for supporters to travel by train. Edin Dzeko and his Manchester City team-mates reflect on their Premier League defeat at Crystal Palace Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany looks dejected after seeing his side slump to defeat in London However, after being sent on their way from the Etihad Stadium at 1.30pm by City legend Mike Summerbee, all of those onboard the six coaches missed the kick-off with some arriving as much as 20 minutes after the start. Some complained that Summerbee's send-off had gone on for too long and was responsible for their late arrival. Now, the club has acknowledged the coaches set off too late and have written to supporters to apologise and advise them that they will be refunding the cost of their match tickets. The letter, seen by Sportsmail, reads: 'The free coach travel was provided to enable supporters to attend this match on a day when return rail travel from Manchester wasn’t an option due to the kick-off time, and the time of the final train back to Manchester. Glenn Murray is mobbed by his Crystal Palace team-mates after he opened the scoring against Man City Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew celebrates with the home fans during their win against Manchester City 'We have liaised with our travel partner and wanted to advise that whilst this was a Bank Holiday, which was factored in to the journey planning, it is accepted that the coaches should have left the Etihad Stadium earlier than they did.

We’ve been here one day. We’re no heroes, just tourists,' Makrus Åsberg, a 25-year-old officer with the police Uppsala, Sweden, told the New York Post. 'We're no heroes, just tourists': The Swedish cops (pictured left to right) Erik Näslund, 26, Samuel Kvarzell, 25, Makrus Åsberg, 25, and Eric Jansberger, 28, said they were just answering the call of duty Mr Asberg, along with Erik Naslund, Samuel Kvarzell and Eric Jansberger, subdued an enraged homeless man who was viciously beating another rider on the train. The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports. Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info.

        "document": "Alec Stewart has expressed his interest in becoming the new Director of England Cricket following the sacking on Wednesday of Managing Director Paul Downton. Stewart, who played in a record 133 Tests for England and is currently director of cricket at Surrey, has not yet been approached by the ECB. But he said: ‘When England come calling, you shouldn’t say no.’ The early bookies’ favourite for the post is Michael Vaughan, the former England captain who is close to the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, and has also made clear his desire to help English cricket out of its current state of chaos. Alec Stewart stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday Stewart lines up with Surrey players for the team photo at the KIA Oval Test matches: 133 Highest score: 190 Runs: 8463 Centuries: 15 Half-centuries: 45 Batting average: 39.54 Stumpings: 14 First test: West Indies, Kingston, Feb 24, '90 Last test: South Africa, The Oval, Sep 4, '03 Stats via ESPNcricinfo But Stewart, who also spoke highly of the early impression Kevin Pietersen has made on his return to the Surrey team, remains a respected figure in the game. And he is open to offers. Asked whether he’d be interested in the post – created by the ECB’s new chief executive Tom Harrison, who confirmed Downton’s demise Wednesday evening – Stewart said: ‘I can’t just say yes until I know what the role and the responsibility are. But, of course, if it was the right role, you’d be stupid not to look at it. ‘As a player I did just about anything that was asked of me. If they asked me to take on a role, and it’s the right role, of course I’d listen and have a big conversation – once the ECB have asked Surrey permission to speak to me, of course, because I’m under contract here. ‘I just want England to be the best side in the world. And if the ECB felt I was the right person to help take them to No 1, then of course I’d look at it. ‘I’ve got a big job here, and that’s what I’m concentrating on. But at the same time you’ve got to make yourself aware of other opportunities, and when England come calling, you shouldn’t say no. ‘If they want someone with experience of being a director of cricket, then I’d have thought I’d be very close to being at the top of that list.’ Stewart (centre front) poses in the Surrey team photo ahead of the start of the County Championship season Stewart was a wicketkeeper-batsman for England. Here he looks on as Australia's Steve Waugh plays a shot towards England fielder Graham Thorpe in the fifth test of an Ashes clash at Edgbaston in 1993 Stewart is carried by team-mates Steve Harmison (left) and Andrew Flintoff, after playing his final Test match, at the Oval in September 2003 against South Africa But Stewart made clear he’d be interested in the job only if there was a clear definition of his accountability. ‘If you do well, you get patted on the back, if you don’t do well, you get moved on. To me, it’s straightforward. But if there are too many bits and pieces in the jigsaw, people can hide. ‘I’m not one for hiding. It’s about making tough decisions, and living and dying by those decisions. And making sure the players play without fear.’ Stewart, who led England in 15 Tests and scored nearly 8,500 runs, was effusive in his praise of Pietersen, whose chances of a surprise England recall increased from highly unlikely to merely improbable following the sacking of Downton – who in turn had sacked Pietersen over a year ago. Kevin Pietersen will feature for Stewart's Surrey outfit in this year's county championships and the former wicket-keeper batsman believes the 34-year-old could still make a comeback at international level ‘We’ve never had a problem with him,’ said Stewart. ‘I’m sure other dressing-rooms may not say the same, but we don’t have to handle him. ‘He fits in well. When he walked in, he went to his locker straightaway: it was like he’d never been away. We can only speak in glowing terms of him.

Alec Stewart stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday Stewart lines up with Surrey players for the team photo at the KIA Oval Test matches: 133 Highest score: 190 Runs: 8463 Centuries: 15 Half-centuries: 45 Batting average: 39.54 Stumpings: 14 First test: West Indies, Kingston, Feb 24, '90 Last test: South Africa, The Oval, Sep 4, '03 Stats via ESPNcricinfo But Stewart, who also spoke highly of the early impression Kevin Pietersen has made on his return to the Surrey team, remains a respected figure in the game. And he is open to offers. Asked whether he’d be interested in the post – created by the ECB’s new chief executive Tom Harrison, who confirmed Downton’s demise Wednesday evening – Stewart said: ‘I can’t just say yes until I know what the role and the responsibility are. But, of course, if it was the right role, you’d be stupid not to look at it. ‘As a player I did just about anything that was asked of me. If they asked me to take on a role, and it’s the right role, of course I’d listen and have a big conversation – once the ECB have asked Surrey permission to speak to me, of course, because I’m under contract here. ‘I just want England to be the best side in the world. And if the ECB felt I was the right person to help take them to No 1, then of course I’d look at it. ‘I’ve got a big job here, and that’s what I’m concentrating on. But at the same time you’ve got to make yourself aware of other opportunities, and when England come calling, you shouldn’t say no. ‘If they want someone with experience of being a director of cricket, then I’d have thought I’d be very close to being at the top of that list.’ Stewart (centre front) poses in the Surrey team photo ahead of the start of the County Championship season Stewart was a wicketkeeper-batsman for England. Here he looks on as Australia's Steve Waugh plays a shot towards England fielder Graham Thorpe in the fifth test of an Ashes clash at Edgbaston in 1993 Stewart is carried by team-mates Steve Harmison (left) and Andrew Flintoff, after playing his final Test match, at the Oval in September 2003 against South Africa But Stewart made clear he’d be interested in the job only if there was a clear definition of his accountability. ‘If you do well, you get patted on the back, if you don’t do well, you get moved on. To me, it’s straightforward. But if there are too many bits and pieces in the jigsaw, people can hide. ‘I’m not one for hiding. It’s about making tough decisions, and living and dying by those decisions. And making sure the players play without fear.’ Stewart, who led England in 15 Tests and scored nearly 8,500 runs, was effusive in his praise of Pietersen, whose chances of a surprise England recall increased from highly unlikely to merely improbable following the sacking of Downton – who in turn had sacked Pietersen over a year ago. Kevin Pietersen will feature for Stewart's Surrey outfit in this year's county championships and the former wicket-keeper batsman believes the 34-year-old could still make a comeback at international level ‘We’ve never had a problem with him,’ said Stewart. ‘I’m sure other dressing-rooms may not say the same, but we don’t have to handle him. ‘He fits in well. When he walked in, he went to his locker straightaway: it was like he’d never been away. We can only speak in glowing terms of him.

Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo  claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

        "document": "A spring snowstorm and icy roads caught Colorado drivers by surprise Friday, causing a 39-vehicle pileup near Boulder and other bad wrecks that shut down highways during the morning commute. No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars. Lisa Lai told the Daily Camera newspaper she avoided hitting a crash in front of her and ended up propped against a highway barrier — and out of the way — as other peoples' vehicles piled up. A tow truck driver works to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36, Friday near Boulder, Colo. A car is stuck under a semi tractor trailer at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36 Numerous crashes and spin outs on icy and snowy highways have closed portions of several interstates and highways in the Denver and Colorado Springs area as well as the mountains 'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado. We have four seasons in one day,' Schmidt said after the sun emerged.

The snowpack in the Colorado and Wyoming valleys where the river originates now ranges from 51 to 79 per cent of normal, said Brian Domonkos, Colorado supervisor of the U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey, which monitors snowfall and water availability. The Colorado River supplies water to about 40 million people and 6,300 square miles of farmland in seven states, including California. A driver stands amid vehicles involved in an accident on wrecked cars The Rocky Mountain snow that melts into the river doesn't flow directly to California and other downstream users. Instead, it's held in a series of reservoirs that release enough water to fulfill the legal allotments to southwestern states under a series of agreements and court rulings. The reservoirs have sufficient water to provide California and other downstream states with their full shares this year and for the foreseeable future, said Matthew Allen, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the reservoir system. California also gets water from the Sierra Nevada range, where the snow cover was the lowest it has ever been in 65 years of record-keeping as of Wednesday. Warm temperatures and scarce snowfall in early March caused the snowpack in Colorado to shrink significantly. 'To see the decline that we saw at the beginning of March, that is abnormal,' Domonkos said. 'And to see it continue almost unabated, almost to now, that's quite abnormal.' Emergency personnel and tow truck drivers work to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup A storm brought up to 11 inches of snow on Thursday and Friday to parts of the Colorado mountains and foothills, but much of it fell east of the Continental Divide and will eventually melt into the South Platte and Arkansas rivers. Preliminary readings showed the snowpack on Friday in the South Platte basin was 87 per cent of normal and 79 percent of normal in the Arkansas basin. The U.S. Drought Monitor says 40 per cent of California is in an exceptional drought, the most severe category, and another 25 per cent is in an extreme drought, the second-most severe.

        "document": "A spring snowstorm and icy roads caught Colorado drivers by surprise Friday, causing a 39-vehicle pileup near Boulder and other bad wrecks that shut down highways during the morning commute. No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars. Lisa Lai told the Daily Camera newspaper she avoided hitting a crash in front of her and ended up propped against a highway barrier — and out of the way — as other peoples' vehicles piled up. A tow truck driver works to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36, Friday near Boulder, Colo. A car is stuck under a semi tractor trailer at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36 Numerous crashes and spin outs on icy and snowy highways have closed portions of several interstates and highways in the Denver and Colorado Springs area as well as the mountains 'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado. We have four seasons in one day,' Schmidt said after the sun emerged. A tow truck driver works to clear the scene of cleanup on the pileup  on Drivers of damaged cars wait at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars And drought-weary Californians, who can't expect much encouragement from mountains elsewhere in the West: Snow that fills the Colorado River is lagging, too, officials said Friday. The snowpack in the Colorado and Wyoming valleys where the river originates now ranges from 51 to 79 per cent of normal, said Brian Domonkos, Colorado supervisor of the U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey, which monitors snowfall and water availability. The Colorado River supplies water to about 40 million people and 6,300 square miles of farmland in seven states, including California. A driver stands amid vehicles involved in an accident on wrecked cars The Rocky Mountain snow that melts into the river doesn't flow directly to California and other downstream users. Instead, it's held in a series of reservoirs that release enough water to fulfill the legal allotments to southwestern states under a series of agreements and court rulings. The reservoirs have sufficient water to provide California and other downstream states with their full shares this year and for the foreseeable future, said Matthew Allen, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the reservoir system. California also gets water from the Sierra Nevada range, where the snow cover was the lowest it has ever been in 65 years of record-keeping as of Wednesday. Warm temperatures and scarce snowfall in early March caused the snowpack in Colorado to shrink significantly. 'To see the decline that we saw at the beginning of March, that is abnormal,' Domonkos said. 'And to see it continue almost unabated, almost to now, that's quite abnormal.' Emergency personnel and tow truck drivers work to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup A storm brought up to 11 inches of snow on Thursday and Friday to parts of the Colorado mountains and foothills, but much of it fell east of the Continental Divide and will eventually melt into the South Platte and Arkansas rivers. Preliminary readings showed the snowpack on Friday in the South Platte basin was 87 per cent of normal and 79 percent of normal in the Arkansas basin. The U.S. Drought Monitor says 40 per cent of California is in an exceptional drought, the most severe category, and another 25 per cent is in an extreme drought, the second-most severe.

Jerry Brown ordered mandatory, statewide water cutbacks by cities and towns, aiming for a 25 percent cut in water use. Extreme drought conditions also spread into Nevada and southern Oregon, along with smaller pockets in Utah and Arizona. Milder drought conditions extend across the rest of the West, except for most of Montana and Wyoming. Other states served by the Colorado River are Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Nevada.

Jack Grealish made his first Premier League start for Aston Villa against QPR on Tuesday night Grealish saw Villa lose twice at Wembley in 2010 - in the League Cup final and in the FA Cup semi-final ‘I went twice to Wembley as a fan, the Man U game and Chelsea game five years ago,’ said Grealish. ‘Unfortunately we didn’t win either of them, hopefully this time we can go and get a result. ‘It would be brilliant to stay in the team for Wembley but at the end of the day the gaffer will pick who he thinks he will win.

You can see what he did at Tottenham with the young lads, bringing them through. Grealish expressed his gratitude towards manager Tim Sherwood for giving him his first start ‘Here he’s brought the younger lads to come and train next to the first team, which is so little but means so much.’ The return to form of Christian Benteke also inspires survival hope. ‘Yes, when you have Christian in the team who can score goals every game,’ Grealish said. ‘We are going to go in Saturday's game (at Tottenham) positive and 100 per cent we will stay up.’",

        "document": "A merry widow from Edinburgh who loves to party the night away dancing on tables admits her lifestyle is a far cry from her own grandparents. Pat Ingles, 69, remembers her grandmother sitting by the fire knitting in a pinny and slippers. In comparison, the retired hairdresser, prefers to dress up in kinky outfits and go out drinking until the early hours. Pat, 69, pictured left in her police woman fancy dress outfit, enjoys pole dancing with friend Julia, 67, right 'I really enjoy myself, I party hard,' she admitted on the Channel 5 show OAPs Behaving Badly. 'I have heard of the saying \"grow old gracefully\" but I don't understand it.' Grandmother-of-three Pat lost her husband 12 years ago to prostate cancer after dutifully caring for him during the last nine years of his life following his diagnosis. Now she's focused on enjoying herself and wants to make the most of the time she has left. She said: 'I have cared for people all my life. I don't want to look after someone full-time again, I want to look after me now. 'Whatever time I have left I am going to party and love it till I die.' Pat in another of her risque outfits gets to grips with an Elvis impersonator in Menorca While Pat likes to hit the town at night, during the day she hits the gym and also enjoys pole-dancing lessons. Thanks to keeping fit and active, she says she feels confident about her appearance as she nears 70 and as a result, she is happy to show off her body in a number of 'kinky' outfits. Her wardrobe includes a risque fancy dress police woman look, air hostess and French Maid outfits, as well as a leather jumpsuit, and she teams them all with stilettos. She said: 'I like to dress sexy, if I can't walk in high heels, I won't go outside. I just like to have fun and feel good in whatever I wear. 'For my age I don't have a bad body. I can walk into a room and I still turn heads and I like that.' Pat, pictured again with the Elvis impersonator, loves to party and stay out dancing on tables Far from being embarrassed by their party pensioner grandparent, Pat's family think she's great fun and love it if she joins them on nights out. Her granddaughter, Paris, 20, said: 'She stays out till 1am dancing on the tables, it's not embarrassing, I don't think \"my nanna shouldn't do that\", it's cool.' Pat isn't alone in her desire to party. She has a partner in crime in her friend Julia Church, 67, who now lives in Menorca. Julia, also a retired hairdresser, moved to the Spanish island with her husband and now parties with her fellow British expats following his death seven years ago. Pat regularly visits her and the pair get glammed up for nights out where they drink and dance the night away. Pat on a night out with Julia, left, who says 'we'll just keep going till we fall to bits' The friends often party all night in Menorca where Julia now lives Julia said: 'You can't judge others like us, we're not normal, we're crazy. Being 67 or 27 it doesn't make any difference, we're exactly the same. 'I don't like the thought of getting old, we'll just keep going till we fall to bits. There's no point worrying about it, you'll make yourself depressed.' Pat has been single for years following the death of her husband and said she has dated some younger men - including a man in his 40s who was younger than her 49-year-old son. But now she's found happiness with Colin, 66. She said: 'We have a fantastic time together, we have good sex, we enjoy each others' company. 'I realised how much I missed that, having someone to care for me and protect me and treat me like a lady.' Julia shows off her pole dancing skills. She admits: 'I don't like the thought of getting old' OAPs Behaving Badly is on Channel 5 Wednesdays at 9pm",

        "document": "The woman falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo has been snapped cutting lines of a suspicious-looking white powder. Sarah Watson, 34, had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender at a Christmas party for the team. But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort £100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her £25,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare. Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle. In one, she is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of an unknown white power in Las Vegas. In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight. The 34-year-old had met Rojo at Manchester United's private Christmas party in a Manchester bar. She said the footballer had approached her and complimented her looks and dress. Despite calling his approach 'cheesy', she had decided to give him her phone number. Later that evening Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. 'My love, where are you?' he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's – known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit – made a shocking proposition. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers. She was depicted in court – and in the national press – as a scheming blackmailer who demanded £100,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model And it was on this basis that the player's lawyers obtained a High Court order preventing her from speaking out. ‘People who look after Marcos claimed I had demanded £100,000 to keep quiet about our encounter,’ she said.. ‘But it was a lie and they knew it. They tried to trap me.’ ‘I didn’t set out to do a kiss and tell, but the chance to make some money to pay for my personal training course was very tempting. I’m a single woman and I had not done anything illegal or that I was ashamed of. '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me £100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated £25,000 legal costs. The defender has not spoken about the incident publicly, while his friend Bereit - who Sarah claims offered her the money - declined to comment.",

Later that evening Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. 'My love, where are you?' he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's – known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit – made a shocking proposition. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers. She was depicted in court – and in the national press – as a scheming blackmailer who demanded £100,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model And it was on this basis that the player's lawyers obtained a High Court order preventing her from speaking out. ‘People who look after Marcos claimed I had demanded £100,000 to keep quiet about our encounter,’ she said.. ‘But it was a lie and they knew it. They tried to trap me.’ ‘I didn’t set out to do a kiss and tell, but the chance to make some money to pay for my personal training course was very tempting. I’m a single woman and I had not done anything illegal or that I was ashamed of. '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me £100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated £25,000 legal costs. The defender has not spoken about the incident publicly, while his friend Bereit - who Sarah claims offered her the money - declined to comment.",

        "document": "The woman falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo has been snapped cutting lines of a suspicious-looking white powder. Sarah Watson, 34, had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender at a Christmas party for the team. But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort £100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her £25,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare. Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle. In one, she is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of an unknown white power in Las Vegas. In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight.

It is understood a teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in Birmingham where extremist Islamic views were being forced on pupils and staff. This includes allegations an al-Qaeda style video featuring masked gunmen was copied in a classroom and teachers punished pupils by making them kneel on tiles. More than 50 teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged as many as 3,000 messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby was a hoax. Scroll down for video Park View School in Birmingham was one of the schools placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism - up to 100 teachers are now being investigated It is understood the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) - the profession's watchdog responsible for banning teachers from classrooms - is looking at 30 disciplinary cases, with an expectation many more teachers will be targeted for their part in the affair. The probe into the Islamic plot last year found evidence of anti-Western rhetoric, intolerance towards gays and creating the perception of a worldwide conspiracy against Muslims. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Allegations under investigation include claims that an al-Qaeda style video was copied at Park View Academy and teachers punished children by making them kneel on the floor, the Sunday Times reports. A group of teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group where they claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby and the Boston bombings, where two bombs were set off at the finish line of the city's marathon, were a hoax. Professional hearings are set to begin next month. More than 50 teachers alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich,  was a hoax In his report, Peter Clarke (pictured) found there had been a 'coordinated, deliberate and sustained action' to introduce an aggressive Islamic ethos in the schools The teaching watchdog has obtained 'dossiers' about some of the 100 staff it is investigating from the Department for Education as part of its inquiries. They are understood to include information from last year's Trojan Horse probe headed by Peter Clarke, the former head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard. His report, published in July, found there had been a 'co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action, carried out by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos into a few schools in Birmingham'. It also highlighted a 'disconcerting pattern' in the schools, including nepotism in staff appointments, bullying of senior teachers, a 'strategy of harassment to oust the head teacher' and the 'reinforcement of Muslim identity to the exclusion or disparagement of others'. A source told the Sunday Times: 'The 100 or so include teachers, teaching assistants and teaching staff. The Department for Education is feeding in information to help corroborate some of what the NCTL has, and, in other cases, flag up new targets.' 'In some cases, some of those teachers and staff are still working at schools, and in other cases they have been removed. 'But although some of them have been removed, the NCTL does not want them to end up anywhere else.' The Trojan Horse scandal started with an anonymous letter in March last year describing an Islamic plot to take over schools in Birmingham called 'Operation Trojan Horse'. The document - now thought to be a hoax - proposed a campaign of installing governors and undermining and then replacing school leaders with staff who would be more sympathetic to their religious agenda. That in turn led to 21 schools being inspected by schools inspector Ofsted, which put six schools in special measures and said five had not done enough to protect children from extremism. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Then in November last year, inspectors found evidence that six independent faith schools in Tower Hamlets, in east London, had an unbalanced curriculum. Several teenage girls have fled to join ISIS in Syria from schools in Tower Hamlets. This Easter, tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed by Tower Hamlets council advising parents to 'lock away' their children's passports if they fear the youngsters may be planning to travel to Syria over the holiday period. Tower Hamlets is the only local authority in London where Muslims account for the largest single religious group.

Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Allegations under investigation include claims that an al-Qaeda style video was copied at Park View Academy and teachers punished children by making them kneel on the floor, the Sunday Times reports. A group of teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group where they claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby and the Boston bombings, where two bombs were set off at the finish line of the city's marathon, were a hoax. Professional hearings are set to begin next month. More than 50 teachers alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich,  was a hoax In his report, Peter Clarke (pictured) found there had been a 'coordinated, deliberate and sustained action' to introduce an aggressive Islamic ethos in the schools The teaching watchdog has obtained 'dossiers' about some of the 100 staff it is investigating from the Department for Education as part of its inquiries. They are understood to include information from last year's Trojan Horse probe headed by Peter Clarke, the former head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard. His report, published in July, found there had been a 'co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action, carried out by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos into a few schools in Birmingham'. It also highlighted a 'disconcerting pattern' in the schools, including nepotism in staff appointments, bullying of senior teachers, a 'strategy of harassment to oust the head teacher' and the 'reinforcement of Muslim identity to the exclusion or disparagement of others'. A source told the Sunday Times: 'The 100 or so include teachers, teaching assistants and teaching staff. The Department for Education is feeding in information to help corroborate some of what the NCTL has, and, in other cases, flag up new targets.' 'In some cases, some of those teachers and staff are still working at schools, and in other cases they have been removed. 'But although some of them have been removed, the NCTL does not want them to end up anywhere else.' The Trojan Horse scandal started with an anonymous letter in March last year describing an Islamic plot to take over schools in Birmingham called 'Operation Trojan Horse'. The document - now thought to be a hoax - proposed a campaign of installing governors and undermining and then replacing school leaders with staff who would be more sympathetic to their religious agenda. That in turn led to 21 schools being inspected by schools inspector Ofsted, which put six schools in special measures and said five had not done enough to protect children from extremism. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Then in November last year, inspectors found evidence that six independent faith schools in Tower Hamlets, in east London, had an unbalanced curriculum. Several teenage girls have fled to join ISIS in Syria from schools in Tower Hamlets. This Easter, tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed by Tower Hamlets council advising parents to 'lock away' their children's passports if they fear the youngsters may be planning to travel to Syria over the holiday period. Tower Hamlets is the only local authority in London where Muslims account for the largest single religious group. An estimated 35 per cent of the population practise Islam, compared with 4.4 per cent across the country according to the latest census.",

Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25 Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National. In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding. And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin. Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to £10,000. Her team will be led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household.

Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25 Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National. In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding. And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin. Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to £10,000.

Speaking in the latest issue of Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former senator and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine Short and sweet: Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose ideology revolves around getting 're-elected at all costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female politicians get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There’s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let’s do something about that,' she said. 'Let’s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that’s OK, and if it does look good, that’s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld. On Tuesday it was announced that she would be making an appearance on her former co-star's Crackle channel web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.",

When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose ideology revolves around getting 're-elected at all costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female politicians get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There’s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let’s do something about that,' she said. 'Let’s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that’s OK, and if it does look good, that’s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld. On Tuesday it was announced that she would be making an appearance on her former co-star's Crackle channel web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.",

        "document": "An obese mother who enjoyed takeaways and boozy nights out has lost more than seven stone after a child on a bus pointed at her and asked whether she was pregnant. Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: \"Has she got a baby in her belly?\"' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week. She added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being. 'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now. 'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone. 'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages. 'Now I can spend more time with the kids.' Lizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'. She added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes. 'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done. I'm really pleased, and I believe she will keep it off as she's found a routine that suits her. 'She's like the old Lizzi I used to know as a little girl.'",

        "document": "A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, \"Wow!\"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.",

Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits.

Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, \"Wow!\"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently.

        "document": "(CNN)The last time Frank Jordan spoke with his son, Louis Jordan was fishing on a sailboat a few miles off the South Carolina coast. The next time he spoke with him, more than two months had passed and the younger Jordan was on a German-flagged container ship 200 miles from North Carolina, just rescued from his disabled boat. \"I thought I lost you,\" the relieved father said. Louis Jordan, 37, took his 35-foot sailboat out in late January and hadn't been heard from in 66 days when he was spotted Thursday afternoon by the Houston Express on his ship drifting in the Atlantic Ocean. \"I was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me, and I was grateful to God that my parents were not going to be worried about me,\" Jordan told CNN. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan told CNN. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" The younger Jordan said he took his sailboat out to the Gulf Stream to find some better fishing, when it capsized.  He broke his shoulder when the boat flipped. Because of the injury, Jordan couldn't repair the boat's mast, which had snapped. \"Everything I owned got broken -- all my electronics, my GPS devices,\" Jordan said.  He was dead in the water. Jordan drifted in the Atlantic, rationing food and water until his shoulder healed. He was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, Jordan said, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" he said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned that they were attracted to his laundry that he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jodran came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital at about 7:30 p.m. Jordan was reported missing January 29, a few days after his last contact with his father. Two months of concern poured out in a phone call with his son's rescuers. Frank Jordan thanked the captain of the Houston Express. \"You're a good man, I swear.  You did what you are supposed to do, and I sure do appreciate it,\" he says. \"And I know my son appreciates it.\" CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.",

He was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, Jordan said, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" he said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned that they were attracted to his laundry that he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jodran came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital at about 7:30 p.m. Jordan was reported missing January 29, a few days after his last contact with his father. Two months of concern poured out in a phone call with his son's rescuers. Frank Jordan thanked the captain of the Houston Express. \"You're a good man, I swear.  You did what you are supposed to do, and I sure do appreciate it,\" he says. \"And I know my son appreciates it.\" CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.",

        "document": "(CNN)The last time Frank Jordan spoke with his son, Louis Jordan was fishing on a sailboat a few miles off the South Carolina coast. The next time he spoke with him, more than two months had passed and the younger Jordan was on a German-flagged container ship 200 miles from North Carolina, just rescued from his disabled boat. \"I thought I lost you,\" the relieved father said. Louis Jordan, 37, took his 35-foot sailboat out in late January and hadn't been heard from in 66 days when he was spotted Thursday afternoon by the Houston Express on his ship drifting in the Atlantic Ocean. \"I was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me, and I was grateful to God that my parents were not going to be worried about me,\" Jordan told CNN. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan told CNN. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" The younger Jordan said he took his sailboat out to the Gulf Stream to find some better fishing, when it capsized.  He broke his shoulder when the boat flipped. Because of the injury, Jordan couldn't repair the boat's mast, which had snapped. \"Everything I owned got broken -- all my electronics, my GPS devices,\" Jordan said.  He was dead in the water.

'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said.

Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings. With figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese, Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure. Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world. Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table, put together by a Harvard Business School academic, looking at a range of living standards Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world Despite national earnings that make us the world’s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a ‘social progress index’ suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers – for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: ‘Overall, within Europe the UK’s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world’s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) ‘The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK’s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.’ The table – which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world – lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd. For Press freedom, the UK is ranked 27th. Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, who headed the research, said: ‘A striking finding is that gross domestic product is far from being the sole determinant of social progress.’",

Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings. With figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese, Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure. Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world. Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table, put together by a Harvard Business School academic, looking at a range of living standards Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world Despite national earnings that make us the world’s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a ‘social progress index’ suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers – for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: ‘Overall, within Europe the UK’s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world’s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) ‘The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK’s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.’ The table – which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world – lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd. For Press freedom, the UK is ranked 27th. Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, who headed the research, said: ‘A striking finding is that gross domestic product is far from being the sole determinant of social progress.’",

        "document": "Two comedians and a Coronation Street actress came out in support of Labour at a party rally. Ben Elton took a swipe at Myleene Klass over her criticism of Ed Miliband's mansion tax plans, at the event also attended by Eddie Izzard, Joey Essex and Sally Lindsay. The comedian told a 1,000-strong crowd at Warrington's Parr Hall the popstar - who claimed the planned levy on homes worth more than £2 million would hit 'little grannies' - had made her money 'showering in a bikini' and should be 'proud to make a contribution'. Elton, who distanced himself from the party under Tony Blair, told supporters he was 'back with Labour'. He said: 'It's no secret that I am now one of that wealthy minority. Me and Myleene Klass. Scroll down for video Comedian Ben Elton, left, took a swipe at Myleene Klass, right, during a rally for Labour supporters The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex posed for a selfie with a fan during rally in Warrington 'I made my money cracking knob gags, she made her money showering in a bikini. 'We should both be proud to make our contribution.' Elton lashed out at the glitzy Black and White fundraising ball staged annually by the Conservatives to raise funds. 'Apparently we are the ones that sneer. Really? Have you seen the Black and White ball? 'Just a little bit of sneering going on I think.' Long-time Labour supporter Eddie Izzard said the party would offer a 'fair chance for everyone'. Actress Sally Lindsay told the crowd 'it makes me sick' that people are having to turn to foodbanks because they cannot afford to eat. The former Coronation Street star backed Labour's plans to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts and called for a 'decent minimum' wage. Coronation Street actress Sally Lindsay joined Justine Miliband and Eddie Izzard at the campaign event Joey Essex was among the crowd at the rally where Ed Miliband announced a £5 billion Future Homes Fund 'That's why I'm voting Labour, that's why I support Ed.' Martin Freeman, one of Britain's most bankable Hollywood stars, was the first celebrity face to back Labour's 2015 General Election campaign. Joey Essex, who posed for selfies with excited fans, was attending the event ahead of interviewing all the party leaders for a TV special. At the rally in Warrington, Ed Miliband told supporters a Labour government would 'get Britain building again'. Announcing a £5 billion Future Homes Fund, he said Labour would build 125,000 new homes. In a speech, he said: 'There's nothing more British than the dream of home ownership. Starting out in a place of your own. But for so many young people today that dream is fading.' He went on: 'Our plan is the first real plan for housebuilding in a generation. 'We will build at least 200,000 homes a year by the end of the Parliament. 'We won't let those large developers just hoard land. 'Waiting for it to go up in value when it could be used to build homes. 'We'll say: either you use the land or you lose the land. 'We will build a new generation of towns, garden cities and suburbs creating over half a million new homes. Ed Miliband, speaking at the rally,  said a Labour government would 'get Britain building again' 'We will make housing the top priority for additional capital investment.' Mr Miliband added: 'The banks will benefit from the taxpayer support we will provide to help people save for their first home. 'In return, we will expect the banks to invest in homes for the next generation. Unlocking £5 billion for 125,000 homes. 'A Labour government will get Britain building again.'",

        "document": "Two comedians and a Coronation Street actress came out in support of Labour at a party rally. Ben Elton took a swipe at Myleene Klass over her criticism of Ed Miliband's mansion tax plans, at the event also attended by Eddie Izzard, Joey Essex and Sally Lindsay. The comedian told a 1,000-strong crowd at Warrington's Parr Hall the popstar - who claimed the planned levy on homes worth more than £2 million would hit 'little grannies' - had made her money 'showering in a bikini' and should be 'proud to make a contribution'. Elton, who distanced himself from the party under Tony Blair, told supporters he was 'back with Labour'. He said: 'It's no secret that I am now one of that wealthy minority. Me and Myleene Klass. Scroll down for video Comedian Ben Elton, left, took a swipe at Myleene Klass, right, during a rally for Labour supporters The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex posed for a selfie with a fan during rally in Warrington 'I made my money cracking knob gags, she made her money showering in a bikini. 'We should both be proud to make our contribution.' Elton lashed out at the glitzy Black and White fundraising ball staged annually by the Conservatives to raise funds. 'Apparently we are the ones that sneer. Really? Have you seen the Black and White ball? 'Just a little bit of sneering going on I think.' Long-time Labour supporter Eddie Izzard said the party would offer a 'fair chance for everyone'. Actress Sally Lindsay told the crowd 'it makes me sick' that people are having to turn to foodbanks because they cannot afford to eat. The former Coronation Street star backed Labour's plans to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts and called for a 'decent minimum' wage. Coronation Street actress Sally Lindsay joined Justine Miliband and Eddie Izzard at the campaign event Joey Essex was among the crowd at the rally where Ed Miliband announced a £5 billion Future Homes Fund 'That's why I'm voting Labour, that's why I support Ed.' Martin Freeman, one of Britain's most bankable Hollywood stars, was the first celebrity face to back Labour's 2015 General Election campaign. Joey Essex, who posed for selfies with excited fans, was attending the event ahead of interviewing all the party leaders for a TV special. At the rally in Warrington, Ed Miliband told supporters a Labour government would 'get Britain building again'. Announcing a £5 billion Future Homes Fund, he said Labour would build 125,000 new homes. In a speech, he said: 'There's nothing more British than the dream of home ownership. Starting out in a place of your own. But for so many young people today that dream is fading.' He went on: 'Our plan is the first real plan for housebuilding in a generation. 'We will build at least 200,000 homes a year by the end of the Parliament. 'We won't let those large developers just hoard land. 'Waiting for it to go up in value when it could be used to build homes. 'We'll say: either you use the land or you lose the land. 'We will build a new generation of towns, garden cities and suburbs creating over half a million new homes. Ed Miliband, speaking at the rally,  said a Labour government would 'get Britain building again' 'We will make housing the top priority for additional capital investment.' Mr Miliband added: 'The banks will benefit from the taxpayer support we will provide to help people save for their first home. 'In return, we will expect the banks to invest in homes for the next generation. Unlocking £5 billion for 125,000 homes. 'A Labour government will get Britain building again.'",

        "document": "A Saudi Arabian man has been arrested at the Mexican border after attempting to flee the country to avoid facing rape charges in Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state – let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah – especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later. Alshammari's attorney Ron Yengich declined to comment on Tuesday, saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest. When asked about Alshammari's connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege. Police did not offer details about the royal connection, besides saying that federal officials reported Alshammari is related to royalty and has family connections to the Saudi Arabian government.",

One such individual, the eldest son of then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a cruise ship off the coast of Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and vanished without a trace, Before he jumped off the ship's 15th floor and disappeared beneath the waves, 29-year-old Jorge Alberto López Amores told his friends to take cellphone videos of his leap. He said: 'I'll stop this cruise, I'll make history.' López got his wish as the boat stopped for two hours to search for him, according to Vivelo Hoy. His story is not the only example of the celebration of excess gone wrong. In 2012, the daughter of oil workers' union boss Carlos Romero Deschamps was brought into the spotlight for posting photos of her luxury lifestyle, including Gucci bags and expensive wine, on Facebook. Her flashy pictures did not sit well in a country where people work an average of 2 226 hours a year and households take in an average of $12,850 per year after taxes. Their stories are just examples of what the author of a book about Mirreyes called the Mexican 'Generation Me'.

'No matter where the money comes - work, inheritance, theft, corruption or lottery- the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts'. By identifying themselves as Mirreyes on social media, these seemingly spoiled brats are possibly creating connections which could be important for business and politics in the future because money attracts powerful friends. They are certainly being noticed. In 2011, a  a website called Mirrreybook was created by Pepe Ceballos. He began posting photos of mMirreyes on the site and it quickly became popular. Ceballos said: 'Mirreyes, who don't have anything to do with narcos [narcotics traffickers], seem like they're competing with them to see who has more. 'We've suddenly seen it in the kind of fashion or the bling-bling. There's more influence from the narcos.' In a recent source of embarrassment, Mirreyes were also featured in a controversial video that showcased the class of 2015 from private school Instituto Cumbres in Mexico City. In the professionally-produced video, well-dressed male students were shown drinking alcohol while carrying out a casting call with young women who dance, strip and wash their feet. Popping bottles: Mirreyes are individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' The flash and the not-so-furious: Members of this select group seem to have few reasons to be upset with life Up in smoke: Some Mirreyes post photos implying they have something in common with narcotics traffickers Look at me: The selfie has become somewhat of a status symbol and Mirreyes frequently use them to show off Future endeavors: By identifying themselves on social media, Mirreyes are possibly creating good connections The all-male  Catholic school was accused of sexism and promoting privilege after the video began to spread across the internet, according to the National Catholic Reporter. The school issued an apology late last month. It said: 'The Cumbres Institute Mexico asks for an apology for the content of the video that offended various persons, who have expressed anger. 'This video in no way represents the values and principles of the school, students, families and graduates. ''The necessary measures are being taken with the students involved and to establish rules so that it does not occur again.'

        "document": "Michael Vaughan has confirmed that he has held talks with the ECB over becoming England’s new supremo as the governing body’s new regime move closer to replacing Paul Downton. The 2005 Ashes winning captain is the hot favourite on the three-man shortlist compiled by the ECB at Thursday’s management board meeting ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart, who have both registered their interest. Vaughan spoke with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison for an hour and has worked closely in the past with chairman-elect Colin Graves at Yorkshire and looks set to be offered the job if he can reach agreement. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket Vaughan spoke to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No 1 choice Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday ‘I had a good chat with Tom which was just about general stuff,’ said Vaughan. ‘We had a one-hour conversation. I have not got a clue what the role is, what the parameters are or what they are looking for. ‘It was the first time I have met him since he was made chief executive because I’ve been away at the World Cup. I knew him from his IMG days and back in the day when he played for Derbyshire but we had not met in person for a long time,’ Vaughan told the Daily Telegraph. ‘It was just a chance to meet up and have a chat and try to kick around a few ideas. It was away from England stuff. It was about the game, the structure and Twenty20. Everything. ‘I like the way he works and his vision for the game and he and Colin Graves will be the perfect partnership. But nothing has changed as far as I’m concerned. I am keen to talk to them when I understand more about the role and what skills are required. 'There will be many others, really good guys, keen to talk who are the type of guys needed to move English cricket forward. ‘I am certainly not in a position to be anywhere near being appointed because I don’t know what the job is. Until we know what it entails I, like all the other candidates, have to look at it and see whether it is for me.’ Former England stars Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role That may be so but the ECB are keen to make a quick appointment and Vaughan looks certain to be the one they want to effectively become a football manager type figure with overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Peter Moores, who is preparing to coach England in their Test series here in the Caribbean, said on Thursday he could work with Vaughan even though the pair had an uneasy relationship when they were captain and coach in 2007. Vaughan has also been a strong critic of Moores in his second coming as coach in his various media roles and it is the amount of successful interests Vaughan has that remain the biggest obstacles towards his appointment. ‘I am loving my job at the moment,’ said Vaughan. ‘I really enjoy the media work and I am now looking forward to getting to the West Indies to watch England win a series they should win and continue where they left off in Test cricket against India last year.’ It will be fascinating to watch Vaughan commentate for BBC’s Test Match Special on a team he may well soon be in charge of. England coach Peter Moores has said he could work with Vaughan despite their uneasy relationship Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket Alec Stewart (Age 52) CURRENT JOB: Director of cricket at Surrey. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Played 133 Tests, more than any England cricketer. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Has established a rapport at Surrey with the out-of-favour Kevin Pietersen — says English cricket needs to be bold. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He’s only interested if there’s a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Andrew Strauss (Age 38) CURRENT JOB: Sky commentator. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Widely respected within English cricket for taking the team to the top of the Test rankings. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: Strauss is still in the early days of his career as a commentator – and is enjoying it. Michael Vaughan (Age 40) CURRENT JOB: Broadcaster and columnist. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Famously led England to the 2005 Ashes — and 26 Test wins overall, a national record. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Joe Root is a particular favourite — he is next in line to replace Alastair Cook as Test captain.

        "document": "Michael Vaughan has confirmed that he has held talks with the ECB over becoming England’s new supremo as the governing body’s new regime move closer to replacing Paul Downton. The 2005 Ashes winning captain is the hot favourite on the three-man shortlist compiled by the ECB at Thursday’s management board meeting ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart, who have both registered their interest. Vaughan spoke with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison for an hour and has worked closely in the past with chairman-elect Colin Graves at Yorkshire and looks set to be offered the job if he can reach agreement. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket Vaughan spoke to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No 1 choice Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday ‘I had a good chat with Tom which was just about general stuff,’ said Vaughan. ‘We had a one-hour conversation. I have not got a clue what the role is, what the parameters are or what they are looking for. ‘It was the first time I have met him since he was made chief executive because I’ve been away at the World Cup. I knew him from his IMG days and back in the day when he played for Derbyshire but we had not met in person for a long time,’ Vaughan told the Daily Telegraph. ‘It was just a chance to meet up and have a chat and try to kick around a few ideas. It was away from England stuff. It was about the game, the structure and Twenty20. Everything. ‘I like the way he works and his vision for the game and he and Colin Graves will be the perfect partnership. But nothing has changed as far as I’m concerned. I am keen to talk to them when I understand more about the role and what skills are required. 'There will be many others, really good guys, keen to talk who are the type of guys needed to move English cricket forward. ‘I am certainly not in a position to be anywhere near being appointed because I don’t know what the job is. Until we know what it entails I, like all the other candidates, have to look at it and see whether it is for me.’ Former England stars Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role That may be so but the ECB are keen to make a quick appointment and Vaughan looks certain to be the one they want to effectively become a football manager type figure with overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Peter Moores, who is preparing to coach England in their Test series here in the Caribbean, said on Thursday he could work with Vaughan even though the pair had an uneasy relationship when they were captain and coach in 2007. Vaughan has also been a strong critic of Moores in his second coming as coach in his various media roles and it is the amount of successful interests Vaughan has that remain the biggest obstacles towards his appointment. ‘I am loving my job at the moment,’ said Vaughan. ‘I really enjoy the media work and I am now looking forward to getting to the West Indies to watch England win a series they should win and continue where they left off in Test cricket against India last year.’ It will be fascinating to watch Vaughan commentate for BBC’s Test Match Special on a team he may well soon be in charge of. England coach Peter Moores has said he could work with Vaughan despite their uneasy relationship Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket Alec Stewart (Age 52) CURRENT JOB: Director of cricket at Surrey. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Played 133 Tests, more than any England cricketer. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Has established a rapport at Surrey with the out-of-favour Kevin Pietersen — says English cricket needs to be bold. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He’s only interested if there’s a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Andrew Strauss (Age 38) CURRENT JOB: Sky commentator. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer.

Now, 18 months later, Lawrence tells ABC that little Wil 'brings a light to our family.' He said he once believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish. Instead, Lawrence said, little Wil has taken the limits off and 'opened so many doors' for his family In return, the father of five has taken the limits off the child and given him a one-of-a-kind ability. The ability to fly. Scroll down for video 'Wil Can Fly:' A Utah photographer, Alan Lawrence (left), created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, Wil (right), who has Down Syndrome appears to be flying The father created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly' in which the toddler appears to be flying in many different scenes. Lawrence, who began taking the photos when Wil was just months old, created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and later cropping himself out. He posted the photos on his blog -- That Dad Blog -- and later on his Instagram account. After receiving positive feedback, Lawrence decided to compile the photos in a calendar and plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down Syndrome foundations, KSL reports. The family recently started a Kickstarter campaign 'When Wil was little, he would lie on his stomach and raise his arms and legs like he was flying. It wasn't something any of my other kids did,' Lawrence told ABC. 'We all said, 'Look, he's flying!' Lawrence said his goal is to raise awareness about Down Syndrome. He admitted in his blog that he and his wife Nikki knew very little about the disorder when Wil was born in October 2013. The father said he hopes to photograph Wil 'flying' in other destinations to raise more awareness. He also told ABC he hopes to help people overseas who do not have access to the same level of care through his YouTube channel by posting therapy tutorials.

        "document": "When Utah photographer Alan Lawrence learned that his newborn son, Wil, had Down Syndrome his 'mind was flooded with many emotions, most of which were not positive.' Now, 18 months later, Lawrence tells ABC that little Wil 'brings a light to our family.' He said he once believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish. Instead, Lawrence said, little Wil has taken the limits off and 'opened so many doors' for his family In return, the father of five has taken the limits off the child and given him a one-of-a-kind ability. The ability to fly. Scroll down for video 'Wil Can Fly:' A Utah photographer, Alan Lawrence (left), created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, Wil (right), who has Down Syndrome appears to be flying The father created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly' in which the toddler appears to be flying in many different scenes. Lawrence, who began taking the photos when Wil was just months old, created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and later cropping himself out. He posted the photos on his blog -- That Dad Blog -- and later on his Instagram account. After receiving positive feedback, Lawrence decided to compile the photos in a calendar and plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down Syndrome foundations, KSL reports. The family recently started a Kickstarter campaign 'When Wil was little, he would lie on his stomach and raise his arms and legs like he was flying. It wasn't something any of my other kids did,' Lawrence told ABC. 'We all said, 'Look, he's flying!' Lawrence said his goal is to raise awareness about Down Syndrome. He admitted in his blog that he and his wife Nikki knew very little about the disorder when Wil was born in October 2013. The father said he hopes to photograph Wil 'flying' in other destinations to raise more awareness. He also told ABC he hopes to help people overseas who do not have access to the same level of care through his YouTube channel by posting therapy tutorials.

        "document": "An argument between two Brisbane neighbours over noise levels has ended in tragedy with one man dead and another charged with manslaughter. Leon Yeaman, 55, was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip Pama, 28, during a row in front of their north Brisbane homes. Mr Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller Road making a lot of noise at around 9pm Thursday night. Phillip Pama covered his face as he left Brisbane Magistrate Courts where he was granted conditional bail on Friday Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr Yeaman was making a commotion. Pama’s defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music and yelling at ‘the world at large’. Pama then confronted Mr Yeaman and it was at that point the situation escalated. Mr Peters said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out ‘blindly’. ‘He was being pushed at the same time he was throwing the punch,’ Mr Peters revealed during a bail application for Pama. ‘He didn't see it connect but he felt it connect.’ The father of three allegedly killed his 55-year-old neighbour with one punch after he refused to turn his music down Paramedics were unable to revive Mr Yeaman who was pronounced dead at the scene at around 11pm on Thursday night. Neighbours described Mr Yeaman as king and generous while his friend John Fisher told ABC Radio he was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music. Pama shielded his face from reporters outside Brisbane Magistrate Courts when he was granted bail on Friday. The Samoan man was ordered to surrender his passport, aherre to a curfew from 6pm to 2am and will have to report to the local police station twice a week. Pama, who has no history of violence, was reportedly ‘beside himself’ with grief. The case is due to return to court on May 18.",

Pama’s defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music and yelling at ‘the world at large’. Pama then confronted Mr Yeaman and it was at that point the situation escalated. Mr Peters said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out ‘blindly’. ‘He was being pushed at the same time he was throwing the punch,’ Mr Peters revealed during a bail application for Pama. ‘He didn't see it connect but he felt it connect.’ The father of three allegedly killed his 55-year-old neighbour with one punch after he refused to turn his music down Paramedics were unable to revive Mr Yeaman who was pronounced dead at the scene at around 11pm on Thursday night. Neighbours described Mr Yeaman as king and generous while his friend John Fisher told ABC Radio he was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music. Pama shielded his face from reporters outside Brisbane Magistrate Courts when he was granted bail on Friday. The Samoan man was ordered to surrender his passport, aherre to a curfew from 6pm to 2am and will have to report to the local police station twice a week. Pama, who has no history of violence, was reportedly ‘beside himself’ with grief. The case is due to return to court on May 18.",

        "document": "Although Hillary Clinton boasts a robust 3.6 million Twitter followers, not even a vast right-wing conspiracy would be able to interact with 2 million of them. According to two popular online measuring tools, no more than 44 per cent of her Twitter fan base consists of real people who are active in using the social media platform. And at least 15 per cent – more than 544,000 – are completely fake. StatusPeople.com, the oldest publicly available Twitter-auditing tool, reports that 44 per cent of the former secretary of state's followers are 'good'; 15 per cent are 'fake'; and 41 per cent are 'inactive,' meaning that they never tweet or reply to any tweets. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO FAKERS: According to one popular online audit tool, only 44 per cent of Hillary Clinton's Twitter followers are real people who participate on the social media platform 'I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT': Clinton has cast herself as a champion of 'everyday Americans' Another Twitter sleuthing website sampled more than 320,000 of Clinton's followers and found that a much larger number of them were 'fake' Just 4 per cent of President Barack Obama's Twitter followers, by comparison, are considered fake. The White House worked overtime to purge most of them after a September 2013 report found that more than half of his followers didn't really exist. Michelle Obama's Twitter audience is 25 per cent fake, according to StatusPeople, along with 21 per cent of Vice President Joe Biden's. Another tool, TwitterAudit.com, sampled 320,000 of Mrs. Clinton's followers and found that 18 per cent were fake. The new measurements will add to the Clinton presidential campaign's embarrassment following news on Tuesday that a large number of her Facebook fans may represent 'likes' that were purchased rather than earned. REALLY? Hillary Clinton's Twitter follower-count appears to be significantly inflated FACEBOOK FAKERY: Clinton boasts two-thirds of a million Facebook 'likes,' but more than 46,000 of them list 'Baghdad' as their hometown Vocativ reported that at least 7 per cent of them listed Baghdad, Iraq as their hometown, a larger number than any U.S. city. That would represent more than 46,000 people. Additional evidence of digital astroturfing is that while most of her U.S. Facebook fans are older than 55, most of the Baghdad contingent is in the 18-34 age range. While Clinton was America's top diplomat, her State Department was buying Facebook 'likes,' according to an Associated Press report from last year. 'In 2013, the State Department, which has more than 400,000 likes and was recently most popular in Cairo, said it would stop buying Facebook fans after its inspector general criticized the agency for spending $630,000 to boost the numbers,' the wire service reported. Clinton left the agency while the inspector general was investigating. ASTROTURF? A woman cast as a kindly, gardening grandma in Clinton's campaign launch video is actually a former abortion lobbyist who once helmed a campaign for Texas state Senator Wendy Davis WHERE'S SCOOBY? Clinton's caravan was spotted in Maumee, Ohio on Monday when she lunched at Chipotle, but no one recognized her Facebook says it has entire teams of employees tasked with rooting out schemes to artificially boost statistics. 'When we catch fraudulent activity, we work to counter and prevent it – including blocking accounts and removing fake likes,' the company reports on its website. Clinton is in Monticello, Iowa on Tuesday for the first stop on her nascent presidential 'listening' tour. She was driven from New York in a van that her campaign aides have dubbed 'Scooby,' after the 'Mystery Machine' van in the Scooby-Doo cartoon series. Daily Mail Online visited Kirkwood Community College on Monday, the site of the event, and heard from students that the former first lady is a 'control freak' who may be pursuing legal status for illegal immigrants because the Democratic Party needs a new pool of loyal voters.",

        "document": "Jonjo O'Neill hosted a media stable visit on Thursday at his Jackdaws Castle yard in Gloucestershire and said he could not be happier with favourite for the Crabbie's Grand National, Shutthefrontdoor. He trains Shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy, the record-breaking Jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys' championship and retire. McCoy has not decided yet whether he is riding Shutthefrontdoor in the £1million Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on  April 11, but everything points to him doing so. Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey AP McCoy rides Shutthefrontdoor to Grand National success later this month O'Neill told Betfred: 'Shutthefrontdoor is in great form. I could not be happier with him. I would have liked to have got a run into him (before the Grand National) but he had an abscess on his sinus in January/February time which took a while to find out where it was. 'We did think about giving him at run at Cheltenham (at the Festival in March) but decided not to. I think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly I did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he wasn't as well as he is now. He is schooling well and is spot on. 'He is a clean-winded horse, who is not hard to get ready. He was ready to run and win first time out at Carlisle. He is going to Aintree fresh and well. It is all down to AP now if he is going ride him. 'You need to have a good classy horse for the National. Before, you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck, now it is a proper race. Aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class. 'He likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan. If he got luck in running over the first mile, I would ride him myself. 'I don't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - I am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at Stratford or whatever! This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11). 'Holywell will run in the Betfred Bowl (April 9) after a great run (fourth) in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit. He put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home. 'He came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [Wednesday] morning. He came alive there last year and seems to like the track.'",

        "document": "The family of murdered Australian baseball player Chris Lane broke down in court as they listened to an emergency call revealing the distressing final moments of his life. The 22-year-old, from Melbourne, was jogging along a street in the rural southern Oklahoma city of Duncan in August 2013, when he was shot in the back with a .22 calibre handgun. His parents, Donna and Peter Lane listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency phone call made by Oklahoma resident who witnessed their son collapsed on the side of the road. Chancey Luna, 17, was charged with  first-degree murder. The teen was riding in a Ford Focus with two teenage friends when he allegedly pulled the trigger as the vehicle drove past. Scroll down for video Family and friends, along with his then girlfriend Sarah Harper (right) broke down as they listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency call made by witnesses who tried to save Chris Lane's (left) life Joy Smith: He's turning blue. 9-11 dispatch: Is he talking to you right now? Joy Smith: No he's [gasping noise], that's all he's doing, making that noise. 9-11: All right, you just stay on the line with me, OK? Joy Smith: If you don't hurry, he's gone. 9-11: Ma'am, they're coming OK, I can't make them come any faster. Joy Smith: Oh my gosh how long's it going to be? He's stopped breathing. Mr Lane, who was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University, was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was randomly gunned down. Family and friends, including Mr Lane's former girlfriend Sarah Harper, heard details about how two bystanders tried to resuscitate the young man who had stopped breathing and wept during the proceedings at the Duncan's District Court on Wednesday. Members of the family broke into loud, uncontrolled sobs when authorities showed the white baseball cap Lane wore when he was shot and photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue. Linda Prior cried as she told court how she attempted to shut Lane's 'big brown eyes' but wasn't able to after failing to resuscitate him. 'The big brown eyes were just staring at me,' Ms Prior, who has first aid training and performed CPR, told the court.

Authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself somewhere inside after ramming the front gates. However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street. Now police believe the suspect, only described as a man in his 30s or 40s, may even be tied to another shooting that occurred Thursday in the Southeast quadrant of the city. Scroll down for video Critical: A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau was shot and critically wounded outside its headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Shooter: Heavily armed tactical teams swarmed to the campus amid reports the shooter had barricaded himself inside 'This started and ended in D.C.,' an FBI source told WUSA. The shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once, according to reports. The campus, built in 2006 and employing thousands, was locked down until about 9pm as authorities unsure where the shooter had gone quickly swarmed. According to the Associated Press, the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car. He went to investigate and it cost him his life. Sharp shooters positioned themselves outside the campus as authorities sought to determine where the shooter had fled Reports: Reports from the scene indicated that loud bangs rang out inside the campus around 8pm, but it wasn't immediately clear if they came from guns or, perhaps, from police 'flash-bang' grenades used to disorient suspects The guard died before 10pm after he was taken to a Washington area hospital, NBC reported. But the gunman trail of violence continued back into DC. Witnesses say some 40 cruisers finally boxed the shooter's green Honda in at 11th and H Streets in Northeast D.C. The barricade caused a collision between the suspect's car and a police cruiser, NBC reports. The suspect was shot several times.

According to the Associated Press, the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car. He went to investigate and it cost him his life.

        "document": "A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen and later died Thursday as part of what began with a suspect kidnapping his own wife at gunpoint in Washington. Authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself somewhere inside after ramming the front gates. However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street. Now police believe the suspect, only described as a man in his 30s or 40s, may even be tied to another shooting that occurred Thursday in the Southeast quadrant of the city.

        "document": "A university undergraduate has claimed that the cost of trying to study in London left her with no other choice than to turn to prostitution. As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than £1,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work– even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman – who asked to remain anonymous – spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her. She said: 'I started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs: in a coffee shop, a pub and as a waitress. None paid enough. 'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.' She added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially. 'I had trouble keeping up with course work, especially if I worked evenings. 'For example at the pub, I'd earn £7 an hour for an eight hour shift, two nights a week, so I'd bring home about £100 weekly. 'I'd just moved to London from the north of England. My family are not well off, so cannot afford to help me much. The student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in London 'I didn't know anyone in London so when I moved here it was starting from scratch.' Initially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better. 'It was an overcrowded, noisy flat with other students,' she said of her halls. She moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services. 'I could afford a place of my own. I advertise through a website and have regular clients. 'I visit them at home, in hotels and occasionally at their workplace.' Despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies. 'It is flexible and fits around my course. 'I can work the hours I want to and scale back around exam time or if I have extra course work.' The woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money. 'In my first year at university I started hearing about students turning to sex work,' she said. 'After a time I met someone on another course who'd been working as a stripper in a bar. 'Through her I met another student doing escorting, she clued me in, said where to advertise, and how to avoid bad clients and work safely. 'She gave me the English Collective of Prostitutes' Rights sheet which tells about the laws and how they work. Although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in London the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work. 'My biggest worry is about being arrested because if I get a criminal record it would stay with me for life. It would be massive obstacle to getting other jobs.' However she remains adamant that this is the best option for her after seeing other friends trying alternative routes. 'Sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work I know of. 'Friends at university are working 10 hour shifts for under the minimum wage. Others are working on zero hour contracts and never know how many hours they will get. 'Sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills. 'I know students who've dropped out and left courses due to financial pressures.' However she is well aware of the risks she is taking and says she takes appropriate precautions to avoid being found out. 'Mostly students doing sex work don't talk about it. If it comes out, it could affect your future and job prospects.' The student's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities: 'Since I started escorting I've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent. 'Another woman I know worked as a part time sex worker to earn enough to travel home to visit her family. 'Sex work among students is much more common than people think, and it is likely to increase as long as fees, rent and the cost of living is so high.'",

Scroll down for video Reality star 'Mama' June Shannon and her estranged husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson have filed a missing persons report after his older brother disappeared three days ago Billy Thompson, center, was last seen on Saturday at Sugar Bear's home in McIntyre, Georgia, where Mama June's daughter Jessica was preparing to go to prom The family have filed a report with the local police department and are especially worried because Billy has been struggling to find work and recently suffered a difficult split from the mother of his children, reports TMZ. The family's popular reality show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, was cancelled by TLC after photos emerged of Shannon spending time with convicted child molester Mark McDaniel. June's oldest daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, has accused McDaniel of repeatedly abusing her when she was just a child. In the wake of the cancellation, Thompson's younger brother - Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson – revealed to The National Enquirer  that Shannon had indulged in a 'threesome' with Sugar Bear and older brother Billy back in 2007. 'June said all of the kids were out of the house and Billy came over to visit them,' Uncle Poodle told the Enquirer in December. 'Billy happened to see her in her undergarments. He then told June, \"If you are dressed like that when I get back, I'm going to have sex with you.\"' Billy, pictured with June's daughter Jessica on the day of Mama June and Sugar Bear's wedding in May 2013 hasn't been seen since April 11 and isn't returning phone calls or texts Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson, above, claimed in December that Mama June had enjoyed a 'threesome' with Sugar Bear and his older brother Billy Poodle then says that when Billy came back June was 'naked in bed and they ended up having a threesome.' When asked about the incident, Billy said he 'couldn't remember.' In the wake of the Enquirer's revelation, Poodle posted a text message exchange he had with June in which she reportedly told him; 'IM GOING TO CONFRONT EVERYONE ON EVERYTHING BCYES YOU HAVE STARTED SOME LIES.' She then reportedly wrote; 'OH AND YEAH YOUR FAKE DATE WITH NATIONAL ENQUIOR WHEN YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT ME BILLY AND SUGAR BEAR IT'S OKAY BC THAT IS MY PAST.' Mama June didn't respond officially to the claims, and Uncle Poodle refused to back down. 'I would be more than happy to take another polygraph test (based) on what June told me,' he said. 'If she denies it.'",

But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night – before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.'

Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.'

        "document": "Barry Beavis, 48, lost his case at the Court of Appeal Millions of motorists face spiralling parking fines after judges ruled yesterday that £85 was not an 'excessively high' penalty for staying too long in a car park. Barry Beavis launched a legal bid to overturn his fine, saying it was unfair, disproportionate and unenforceable. But in a landmark ruling, appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither 'extravagant or unconscionable'. Motoring groups reacted in fury to the decision, accusing the judges – who are thought to earn more than £200,000 a year – of being 'out of touch'. Mr Beavis, from Chelmsford, Essex, had gone to court to fight what he called the 'bullying and threatening' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces. The 48-year-old, who runs a fish and chip shop, got the £85 fine in April 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the Riverside Retail park in Chelmsford. The car park, run by parking firm ParkingEye Ltd, allowed two hours of free parking, but Mr Beavis stayed for three. He claimed the £85 charge against him was disproportionate and vowed to fight the companies who 'extort money by threatening and bullying people into paying up'. But yesterday judges said the fine was enforceable because it was not 'excessively high'. Mr Beavis said he was 'absolutely furious' and planned to appeal. Meanwhile motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys and would open the floodgates for unscrupulous profit-hungry firms 'falling over themselves' to ramp up the already hefty penalties they impose. Ian Taylor, of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'I think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think £85 isn't extravagant. 'An £85 penalty may not seem much to a rich lawyer – it's probably less than many charge for an hour. But for the average hard-pressed motorist trying to make ends meet, it's a very heavy and unfair burden.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said the ruling would hand parking firms a 'blank cheque' to milk drivers, adding: 'This decision could cost motorists millions. 'If judges believe £85 is not an extravagant amount then what is? £100? £200? Our fear is that parking firms will now be falling over themselves to raise their penalty charges and punish drivers.' Mr Beavis had parked his car at the Riverside Retail Park in Chelmsford, pictured above, on April 15, 2013, The retail site, pictured above, offers two free hours of parking and Mr Beavis was fined after he returned 56 minutes late Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said: 'We are concerned that this decision waters down the law on penalty charges and may encourage excessive default charges.' And AA president Edmund King said: 'Britain's motorists really will think judges are out of touch with everyday life if they consider £85 to be a reasonable amount of money for a parking penalty. £85 may not seem much to highly paid lawyers but it represents a great deal of money to cash-strapped motorists.' He added: 'This is a licence to print money for people who have now been handed an open cheque-book and invited to make up the figures as they like.' Speaking outside of the Court of Appeal Mr Beavis said he would now be taking the case to the Supreme Court Parking trap: Many motorists face steep fines for running a few minutes over their allotted time The three judges who unanimously dismissed the challenge – Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lord Justice Patten and Sir Timothy Lloyd – are all thought to earn around £202,000 a year. Yesterday ParkingEye welcomed the judgment, saying it gave 'clarity to motorists and the parking industry' and 'further confirms that our parking charges are fair, reasonable and legally enforceable'. But speaking outside court, Mr Beavis said: 'These firms are not run on a moral basis, they're only out to make as much money as they can, to profiteer from unsuspecting motorists. I am utterly furious and will continue the fight.' Mr Beavis's action comes after the Daily Mail revealed how rogue firms are making millions of pounds from fines handed to motorists who overstay – sometimes for only a few minutes – in car parks at hospitals, railway stations and shopping centres. Cancer sufferers and patients whose treatments have over-run are among those who have been ripped off by the parking firms. Three judges unanimously dismissed his challenge at the Court of Appeal, saying the amount he was charged 'is not extravagant or unconscionable'.",

Mr Beavis, from Chelmsford, Essex, had gone to court to fight what he called the 'bullying and threatening' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces. The 48-year-old, who runs a fish and chip shop, got the £85 fine in April 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the Riverside Retail park in Chelmsford. The car park, run by parking firm ParkingEye Ltd, allowed two hours of free parking, but Mr Beavis stayed for three. He claimed the £85 charge against him was disproportionate and vowed to fight the companies who 'extort money by threatening and bullying people into paying up'. But yesterday judges said the fine was enforceable because it was not 'excessively high'. Mr Beavis said he was 'absolutely furious' and planned to appeal. Meanwhile motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys and would open the floodgates for unscrupulous profit-hungry firms 'falling over themselves' to ramp up the already hefty penalties they impose. Ian Taylor, of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'I think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think £85 isn't extravagant. 'An £85 penalty may not seem much to a rich lawyer – it's probably less than many charge for an hour. But for the average hard-pressed motorist trying to make ends meet, it's a very heavy and unfair burden.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said the ruling would hand parking firms a 'blank cheque' to milk drivers, adding: 'This decision could cost motorists millions. 'If judges believe £85 is not an extravagant amount then what is? £100? £200? Our fear is that parking firms will now be falling over themselves to raise their penalty charges and punish drivers.' Mr Beavis had parked his car at the Riverside Retail Park in Chelmsford, pictured above, on April 15, 2013, The retail site, pictured above, offers two free hours of parking and Mr Beavis was fined after he returned 56 minutes late Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said: 'We are concerned that this decision waters down the law on penalty charges and may encourage excessive default charges.' And AA president Edmund King said: 'Britain's motorists really will think judges are out of touch with everyday life if they consider £85 to be a reasonable amount of money for a parking penalty. £85 may not seem much to highly paid lawyers but it represents a great deal of money to cash-strapped motorists.' He added: 'This is a licence to print money for people who have now been handed an open cheque-book and invited to make up the figures as they like.' Speaking outside of the Court of Appeal Mr Beavis said he would now be taking the case to the Supreme Court Parking trap: Many motorists face steep fines for running a few minutes over their allotted time The three judges who unanimously dismissed the challenge – Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lord Justice Patten and Sir Timothy Lloyd – are all thought to earn around £202,000 a year. Yesterday ParkingEye welcomed the judgment, saying it gave 'clarity to motorists and the parking industry' and 'further confirms that our parking charges are fair, reasonable and legally enforceable'. But speaking outside court, Mr Beavis said: 'These firms are not run on a moral basis, they're only out to make as much money as they can, to profiteer from unsuspecting motorists. I am utterly furious and will continue the fight.' Mr Beavis's action comes after the Daily Mail revealed how rogue firms are making millions of pounds from fines handed to motorists who overstay – sometimes for only a few minutes – in car parks at hospitals, railway stations and shopping centres. Cancer sufferers and patients whose treatments have over-run are among those who have been ripped off by the parking firms. Three judges unanimously dismissed his challenge at the Court of Appeal, saying the amount he was charged 'is not extravagant or unconscionable'.",

The star, known for appearing in All Creatures Great and Small and playing Winston Churchill several times, is auctioning off more than 200 items he has collected over his career. Mr Hardy, 89, is a keen military historian who studied English with J.R.R. Tolkien and is now an expert on the medieval longbow.

The piece was created by artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s after being commissioned by Mr Hardy himself, and has an estimate of £4,000 to £6,000. There is also a longbow made from yew with a mother-of-pearl handle, as well as a portrait of Mr Hardy holding the bow, which is set to sell for up to £2,000.

A total of 238 lots are being sold by Dominic Winter auctioneers at its saleroom in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. Mr Hardy, who lives in the Cotswolds, said that he was sad to sell his collection. 'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said. 'Entrusting it all to Dominic Winter and Co has taken away much of the pain, and through them I wish anyone who comes to possess anything that was mine as much joy and pleasure as it has given me through the years.'

Mr Hardy was taught by Tolkien and C.S. Lewis when he studied English at Magdalen College, Oxford, and he has published two books on the history of the longbow. He was also consulted as an expert during the raising of the Tudor shipwreck the Mary Rose.

        "document": "Veteran actor Robert Hardy is selling his enormous collection of antiques in a £100,000 auction after deciding to downsize his home. The star, known for appearing in All Creatures Great and Small and playing Winston Churchill several times, is auctioning off more than 200 items he has collected over his career. Mr Hardy, 89, is a keen military historian who studied English with J.R.R. Tolkien and is now an expert on the medieval longbow. Sale: Actor Robert Hardy is selling off his collection of antiques including a diorama of the Battle of Agincourt Cabinets: A pair of early Victorian items of furniture made by Gillows of Lancaster which are set to fetch up to £4,000 at the auction on Saturday Portrait: A painting of Mr Hardy holding a longbow, reflecting his interest in medieval history One of the most unusual items featured in the auction of his possessions is a hand-painted limewood diorama depicted the progress of the Battle of Agincourt in 3D. The piece was created by artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s after being commissioned by Mr Hardy himself, and has an estimate of £4,000 to £6,000. There is also a longbow made from yew with a mother-of-pearl handle, as well as a portrait of Mr Hardy holding the bow, which is set to sell for up to £2,000. The actor is also selling paintings, furniture, swords, flintlock rifles, silverware and a fine collection of crystal chandeliers. Diorama: The 3D model was commissioned specially by Mr Hardy from artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s Close-up: The piece was rendered in amazing detail showing the progress of the battle in 1415 Luxurious: A view of many of the items of furniture and other antiques which are being sold Dozens of books, some dating back to the 17th century, are included in the auction which is set to take place this Saturday. A total of 238 lots are being sold by Dominic Winter auctioneers at its saleroom in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. Mr Hardy, who lives in the Cotswolds, said that he was sad to sell his collection. 'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said.

Track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club which the retiring rider fervently supports. Wright, who had seven seasons at Arsenal and broke every scoring record in the book, will hand over McCoy’s trophy before travelling back into London to present his BBC5Live radio phone in. AP McCoy will be presented with his final champion jockeys trophy by Ian Wright at Sandown on Saturday Wright (centre) is now a television pundit but played for Arsenal during his years as a professional McCoy is a huge Arsenal supporter and has been invited to attend a home game before the end of the season Sandown initially tried to secure Thierry Henry to be the Arsenal celebrity to hand over the trophy to McCoy. But his Sky employers vetoed the move. A request to secure another Arsenal legend in Tony Adams also proved logistically impossible because he currently manages Gabala in Azabaijan. A Sandown spokesman said; ‘Tony wanted to do it but his side are playing on Friday night and he just could not get back on time. Tony’s wife will be at Sandown on Saturday along with Ian and his wife.’ Another famous Arsenal name expected at Sandown is Liam Brady, one of McCoy’s sporting heroes from his childhood. Wright was a player for Arsenal as a striker for seven years, from 1991 until 1998 Iconic Arsenal striker Thierry Henry (centre) was asked to present the award but Sky did not allow it Family commitments will keep McCoy away from the Emirates on Sunday when his team host Chelsea in a top of the table clash. He told Racemail: ‘I have a kind invitation from the chairman to attend any home game before the end of the season.’",

        "document": "Gordon Brown has warned that the Scottish nationalists want an SNP vote in the General Election to force a second referendum on independence. The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion'. But that her party want 'chaos and constitutional crisis' at Westminster to force another independence referendum. Scroll down for video Gordon Brown, pictured campaigning this week, has warned that the SNP want to use the chaos after the election to force another referendum on Scottish independence and urged 'patriotic Scots' to vote Labour And he warned that those casting their vote on May 7 will be deciding the future of Scotland for the next few years. Mr Brown was speaking during a joint event with local Labour candidate and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander at Elderslie Village Hall in Renfrewshire. He said: 'There is an SNP candidate in this constituency. She says vote SNP, get SNP MPs at Westminster and we will twist their arms and get another referendum. 'Remember what the SNP used to say - the referendum was once in a generation, then it changed a little to once in a lifetime, then it was once every 15 years and now when you ask Ms Sturgeon about this her answers are all evasion. She cannot give a straight answer to the question. 'But does not the SNP candidate in this constituency tell the truth, that what they want is an SNP vote not to deliver social justice but to deliver the chaos and constitutional crisis at Westminster to as she said force a second referendum. 'And I say I don't want the divisiveness, I don't want the bitterness, I don't want the acrimony, I don't want the divisions between families and communities in the next few months that we had in the past few months.' The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion' Mr Brown urged people to vote Labour to end the bedroom tax, food bank poverty, zero-hours contracts and the neglect of the NHS. He added: 'When you vote on May 7 remember that you are not just voting to end Tory austerity and the possibility of five more years of the bedroom tax and everything else, you're also voting on whether you are going to allow the SNP to use your vote to try to force a second referendum on this country within a few months or after the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.' He also said that Labour will hold an economic summit immediately after the General Election to boost jobs, expand city deals, encourage investment and provide jobs and training for young people. Mr Brown also urged people to be 'proud patriotic Scots' and back Labour's plan for full employment in Scotland. He said: 'Patriotism means, yes, supporting a strong Scottish parliament, but it doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation across the whole country that can deliver us full employment and more jobs. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the money that comes from the bankers' bonus tax that will allow Scottish young people to have jobs in the future. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation on research and innovation that will replace the Linwoods of the past and the lost jobs of the present with the new high-quality jobs of the future. 'And, yes, patriotism means a strong Scottish parliament but it doesn't need or require us to reject the partnership that allows us to fund the pensions of this country, sharing the resources of 60 million people across the whole country, far better than pooling the resources of only five million people, to secure the best pensions imaginable.' SNP Leader Nicola Sturgeon joins  female activists in Glasgow's Buchanan Street to launch the party's womens pledge today Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: 'While Gordon Brown appears to be re-fighting last year's referendum, the SNP are out talking to voters about next month's General Election and the huge opportunity to make Scotland stronger at Westminster. The contrast could not be clearer. 'Unfortunately for Labour Brown's speech this morning simply reminds people once again of how Labour stood shoulder to shoulder with the Tories for two and a half years to talk Scotland down. 'The question Labour's current leadership have repeatedly failed to answer is if there are more anti-Tory MPs - between the SNP and Labour - than there are Tory MPs, will they work with us to lock the Tories out and to deliver better policies for people not just in Scotland but across the rest of the UK. 'A strong team of SNP MPs can give Labour the backbone to oppose further cuts and pursue a progressive alternative to austerity.'

'And I say I don't want the divisiveness, I don't want the bitterness, I don't want the acrimony, I don't want the divisions between families and communities in the next few months that we had in the past few months.' The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion' Mr Brown urged people to vote Labour to end the bedroom tax, food bank poverty, zero-hours contracts and the neglect of the NHS. He added: 'When you vote on May 7 remember that you are not just voting to end Tory austerity and the possibility of five more years of the bedroom tax and everything else, you're also voting on whether you are going to allow the SNP to use your vote to try to force a second referendum on this country within a few months or after the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.' He also said that Labour will hold an economic summit immediately after the General Election to boost jobs, expand city deals, encourage investment and provide jobs and training for young people. Mr Brown also urged people to be 'proud patriotic Scots' and back Labour's plan for full employment in Scotland. He said: 'Patriotism means, yes, supporting a strong Scottish parliament, but it doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation across the whole country that can deliver us full employment and more jobs. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the money that comes from the bankers' bonus tax that will allow Scottish young people to have jobs in the future. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation on research and innovation that will replace the Linwoods of the past and the lost jobs of the present with the new high-quality jobs of the future. 'And, yes, patriotism means a strong Scottish parliament but it doesn't need or require us to reject the partnership that allows us to fund the pensions of this country, sharing the resources of 60 million people across the whole country, far better than pooling the resources of only five million people, to secure the best pensions imaginable.' SNP Leader Nicola Sturgeon joins  female activists in Glasgow's Buchanan Street to launch the party's womens pledge today Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: 'While Gordon Brown appears to be re-fighting last year's referendum, the SNP are out talking to voters about next month's General Election and the huge opportunity to make Scotland stronger at Westminster. The contrast could not be clearer. 'Unfortunately for Labour Brown's speech this morning simply reminds people once again of how Labour stood shoulder to shoulder with the Tories for two and a half years to talk Scotland down. 'The question Labour's current leadership have repeatedly failed to answer is if there are more anti-Tory MPs - between the SNP and Labour - than there are Tory MPs, will they work with us to lock the Tories out and to deliver better policies for people not just in Scotland but across the rest of the UK. 'A strong team of SNP MPs can give Labour the backbone to oppose further cuts and pursue a progressive alternative to austerity.' From left, Anas Sarwar MP, former prime minister Gordon Brown and former leader of the Scottish Labour party Johann Lamont attend the Scottish Labour campaign launch to keep Scotland part of the UK in 2013",

German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters praised the city for tackling what she called 'the long repressed confrontation with the special role Munich played.' Gruetters noted that Germany's effort to examine its past - which encompassed World War II and the murder of millions the Nazis considered unworthy of life - is getting harder by the year because the number of witnesses is dwindling.

Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud.

        "document": "Mike Tindall wouldn't have moved any quicker had he been surging towards the posts in a Six Nations clash at Twickenham. In Aintree's crowded unsaddling area, the former England captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number '3', with his wife, Zara Phillips, scampering in hot pursuit. Not even a hug from AP McCoy could check his momentum. No wonder. Tindall was beaming from ear-to-ear having just seen Monbeg Dude, the horse whom he owns with James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson, run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior, who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1, returned. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall and wife Zara Philipps at Aintree ahead of the Grand National Tindall celebrates after watching his horse Monbeg Dude finish third in the National Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost £12,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. Here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the Crabbie's Grand National. The £88,400 was by far the biggest pot Monbeg Dude has collected in his 24-race career but the reactions of Tindal et al (ITALICISE) showed this was about far more than money. 'Pride is the word I would use,' said Michael Scudamore. 'I am so happy for the horse. He is unbelievably tough and brave. To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow. But what a great day. I really appreciate everything about this atmosphere now.' He wasn't the only one. Aintree, even when you are defeated, is a place where dreams can come true.",

Tindall was beaming from ear-to-ear having just seen Monbeg Dude, the horse whom he owns with James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson, run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior, who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1, returned. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall and wife Zara Philipps at Aintree ahead of the Grand National Tindall celebrates after watching his horse Monbeg Dude finish third in the National Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost £12,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. Here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the Crabbie's Grand National. The £88,400 was by far the biggest pot Monbeg Dude has collected in his 24-race career but the reactions of Tindal et al (ITALICISE) showed this was about far more than money. 'Pride is the word I would use,' said Michael Scudamore. 'I am so happy for the horse. He is unbelievably tough and brave. To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow. But what a great day. I really appreciate everything about this atmosphere now.' He wasn't the only one. Aintree, even when you are defeated, is a place where dreams can come true.",

They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team.

And with the surge in immigrant population, Republican presidential candidates have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established. CIS director of research Steven Camarota said that the growth in immigrant population has 'important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment'. 'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner.

The 44-year-old from Oldham decided had just returned from Algeria and wanted to complain about the temperatures he experienced during his holiday. Police tweeted the anecdote after the man tried to lodge an official complaint at the Great Manchester Police Chadderton division. Great Manchester Police Chadderton division revealed a man lodged a complaint that the weather on his holiday was 'too hot' The incident was shared by the police press office on its Facebook page, along with a warning that members of the public should not waste police time. There was a warning that such an offence can carry a maximum punishment of six months' imprisonment and/or a fine. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police told MailOnline Travel: 'The male was advised that this was not a police problem.' Following the post being shared on Facebook, there were mixed reactions to the man's actions. Janine Gamblen wrote: 'Some people really are just stupid,' while Sarah Edwards added: 'Only in Oldham.' The 44-year-old man had recently returned to the UK from a holiday in Algeria (file photo) 'The mind boggles,' commented Tracy Ayre while Suzi Force believes the man should have been punished, saying: 'Give him a holiday in a cell, maybe he will think twice next time!' However, Joanne Parker made light of the incident writing: 'Haha funny...would love to have seen the police face.' The current temperatures in Algeria is 28C, and this has remained fairly constant over the last week or two. Temperatures are set to peak at 25C over the next three days in England, however the north will see slightly lower temperatures than the south. It's not known if the Oldham man travelled to the Sahara Desert in Algeria, where he would undoubtedly have been 'hot'",

Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his phone in the middle of a match. The two-time national champion was exposed when his opponent lodged a complaint when he grew suspicious about his frequent trips to the lavatory. Tournament organisers found Nigalidze had stored a mobile phone in a cubicle, covered in toilet paper. They announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page. The complaint was made by Nigalidze's opponent in their sixth-round match in the tournament, Armenia's Tigran Petrosian. He said: 'Nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet. 'I noticed that he would always visit the same toilet partition, which was strange, since two other partitions weren't occupied. 'I informed the chief arbiter about my growing suspicions and asked him to keep an eye on Gaioz. 'After my opponent left the very toilet partition yet another time, the arbiters entered it. 'What they found was the mobile phone with headphones; the device was hidden behind the pan and covered with toilet paper.' Tournament organisers at the Dubai Open Chess tournament announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page When officials confronted the Georgian, he denied owning the device but officials found the phone was logged into a social networking site under his name. They also found his match being analysed in one of the chess applications. He was promptly removed from the tournament and could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game. When questioned about the offence, Nigalidze said: 'Not everything is true in what Petrosian said'. This is not the first time a player was caught cheating at a chess tournament. In July 2013, Bulgarian player Borislav Ivanov was suspended from playing for four months by his national federation. It had been found most of his moves matched those of the leading computer chess analysis programs. Two years earlier the French chess federation suspended three players, including the national team captain, when it was alleged they used text messages, a remote chess computer and coded signals to beat the opposition at the 2010 Chess Olympiad. In 2008, at the Dubai Open, an Iranian player was banned when he was found to be receiving help from someone watching the game's live broadcast on the internet and was sending the moves through text messages. Tournaments sanctioned by the International Chess Federation - including the Dubai Open - do not allow players to carry mobile phones and other electronic devices during matches.",
