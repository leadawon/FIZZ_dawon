He added that children would continue to be abused while people like Lee continued to view such material, and that \"society would not tolerate such behaviour\". Judge Kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist Lee or the community. Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images. Earlier, prosecutor Simon Jenkins said that when police went to Lee's then Belfast home on 5 June, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for. On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which Lee admitted creating. During interview, Lee said that he had been downloading images \"for perhaps the last nine years\".

The upgrade has made the facility more sensitive. The facility is for studying radio emissions. The radio emissions are coming from objects in space. And the new technique he mentions counters the smearing effect you would ordinarily expect to get if you took a long exposure of a rapidly rotating body (Jupiter's \"day\" lasts just 10 hours). The result is a wonderfully detailed impression of what is happening under the immediate surface of the many-banded weather systems that race across the top of planet's atmosphere. The team looks at the glow of ammonia because it is a tracer for the dynamical flow in the planet's gases, which are dominated by hydrogen and helium. At Earth, you might do something similar by using water as the tracer. \"We see the actual glow of the ammonia itself, and the variation in depth is correlated with brightness,\" explained Dr Wong. \"The deepest we can see in this dataset is about 12 Bar - 12 times the Earth's atmospheric pressure.\" Plumes of ammonia are observed to rise up in waves. The team writes in the journal Science that the ammonia in these plumes will eventually condense out at higher altitudes, and could explain the ammonia ice clouds detected by the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s. \"All told, there is a wealth of information about the structure of Jupiter's atmosphere in these new VLA images,\" said Imke de Pater, the lead author on the Science paper. \"We hope to resolve a number of outstanding questions with these and future studies using similar techniques.\" Prof de Pater wants to try similar observations at the gas giants Saturn and Uranus. The research is a nice prelude to the next probe set to visit Jupiter: the US space agency satellite Juno arrives at the enormous planet on 4 July.

Staffan de Mistura spoke after briefing the Security Council. The topic of the briefing was the peace process. A partial truce was agreed in February. The partial truce is \"barely alive\". Violence in Syria has intensified in recent days, despite the ceasefire. At least 20 civilians were reportedly killed on Wednesday in government strikes on a hospital and nearby residential building in eastern Aleppo. The dead included children, a dentist and the only paediatrician left in rebel-held areas of the city, civil defence volunteers told AFP news agency. The upsurge in fighting in Syria's largest city comes amid reports that government forces, backed by Russian air power, are gearing up for a major offensive there.

The escalation has threatened to derail the UN-brokered peace talks. The UN-brokered peace talks resumed last month. The Western-backed opposition delegation, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), last week suspended its role to protest against alleged ceasefire violations by the government and a fall in humanitarian aid deliveries to besieged areas. Speaking on Wednesday after a third round of talks in Geneva, Mr de Mistura said the fragile \"cessation of hostilities\" \"could collapse any time\". He said that over the past 48 hours an average of one Syrian had been killed every 25 minutes and one wounded every 13 minutes. For the peace talks to succeed, Mr de Mistura said, hostilities would need to be reduced to the levels seen immediately following the February agreement. Calling on the US and Russia to co-operate, Mr de Mistura said that the legacies of both President Barack Obama and President Vladimir Putin were linked to the success of the peace process in Syria. There will be one or two more rounds of talks before July, Mr de Mistura said. He added: \"There are still major differences on the major issues, but there is movement on certain areas where there was not before.\" Mr de Mistura also said that equal rights and equal representation in major institutions for women was essential to the transition to a new Syria. The peace talks do not involve the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra front and the so-called Islamic State, which have been fighting government forces and other rebels across Syria. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group confirmed on Wednesday that the air strikes on a hospital and nearby buildings in Aleppo were carried out by \"regime airplanes\". Separately, 11 people were killed in western Aleppo earlier on Wednesday, the Syrian Observatory said. More than 270,000 people have been killed since Syria's bitter civil war conflict erupted in 2011 and millions have been forced to flee.",

The sum is the equivalent of BBC Four, CBBC and CBeebies, which would have to be taken off air, Mr Purnell said at an event to  relaunch the iPlayer service. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the move should be discussed during talks to renew the BBC's charter before 2017. Mr Purnell, who previously held the post in the Labour government, said \"it would be a huge risk to do it now\". \"The choice would be: either we take those services off or the government would have to have a higher licence fee,\" he said in reference to BBC Four - the arts and culture channel - and the BBC's children's stations. He argued decriminalisation would inevitably lead to greater non-payment of the TV licence, which would force an increase in the fee. It is currently £145.50 and has been frozen at that annual amount since 2010. It is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device. In 2012 about 155,000 people were convicted and fined for not paying the licence fee, while there were some 180,000 prosecutions. Mr Purnell added downgrading licence fee evasion to a civil offence would penalise the poor. Mr Purnell made a statement. The statement made by Mr Purnell was about licence fee evasion. Mr Purnell suggested that downgrading licence fee evasion to a civil offence would penalise the poor. \"Either you have a low penalty - in which case the evasion rates would go up and everyone would have to pay a higher licence fee - or a penalty which is higher and more difficult to pay,\" he said. The BBC has previously said \"legislation is a matter for the government\". The BBC has a stance on legislation. The BBC believes legislation is a matter for the government. \"Just a 1% increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around £35m, the equivalent of around 10 BBC local radio stations,\" it added. The government has floated the idea to ease pressure on the courts system. But it will not be discussed before charter renewal talks - which determine how the BBC is funded what it does and how it is managed. The current BBC charter runs out in 2016. Meanwhile, Labour MP John McDonnell has tabled an Early Day Motion in parliament calling on the BBC to reverse its decision to close BBC Three as a television channel. The motion stated BBC Three has been the home of programmes including Gavin and Stacey, and raised fears changes could lead to compulsory redundancies. It added the BBC should receive a licence fee increase that tracks inflation when the corporation's charter is renewed next year.",

The firm said piloting of larger jets could be controlled in this way. The firm said larger jets, such as cargo planes, could be controlled without the need for a crew on board. However, one aviation expert told the BBC he thought the industry would be unlikely to adopt such technology due to a perception of being potentially unsafe. Drone specialist Tekever, which works with security firms, police forces and the military, adapted existing Electroencephalography (EEG) technology so it could issue instructions to the software used to give the unmanned drone instructions. EEG works by detecting activity in specific parts of the brain. After several months of training, \"pilots\" are said to be able to teach their brain how to think about moving a small circle on a computer screen either up or down, which in turn steers the drone left or right. \"We believe people will be able to pilot aircraft just like they perform everyday activities like walking or running,\" said Ricardo Mendes, Tekever's chief operating officer. \"We truly believe that Brainflight represents the beginning of a tremendous step change in the aviation field, empowering pilots and de-risking missions, and we're looking forward to deliver these benefits to the market with highly innovative products.\" In the future, some of this technology may be put to use to control much larger aircraft, although Mr Mendes acknowledged considerable challenges with both regulatory hurdles and public confidence.

Mr Mendes said the technology would incorporate safety measures to counteract the effects of someone having, for example, a seizure while piloting. \"There are algorithms on board that prevent bad things from happening,\" he told the BBC.

US crude oil inventories fell by 4.2 million barrels to 537.1 million barrels in the week to May 20, according to US Department of Energy data. Canada is the biggest supplier to the US and wildfires in the western provinces have reduced supplies by about a million barrels per day. Talks in recent months between Opec and Russia about freezing oil production had already encouraged a price rise. Short-term disruptions to oil supplies have also lifted the price, offsetting higher production from Iran and Saudi Arabia.

The UK Border Agency has insisted something. The something that the UK Border Agency has insisted is that the civil servants will be properly trained. It is expected they would mainly check the passports of travellers arriving from the European Economic Area and man so-called \"e-gates\" where passengers use their biometric passports. A UKBA spokesman said: \"The security of the UK border remains our top priority and it is absolutely right we explore all options to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union action.\" However, union chiefs expressed concern that the officials might not be properly trained and that borders could be put at risk. Mr Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, blamed ministers for leaving it so late to try and resolve the dispute. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the call to civil servants was an example of \"blind panic\" at the 11th hour, he said, and accused the government of engaging in a misleading \"PR exercise\" about public sector pensions to try to force through \"damaging\" changes. \"Instead of scratching around trying to put untrained people on the front line, they should say today they want urgent talks to try to resolve the dispute,\" he said. The government has confirmed earlier reports that UKBA is planning to fly some officials home from overseas positions to help deal with the strike. In the wake of the recent row between Home Secretary Theresa May and former UK border force chief Brodie Clark over the relaxation of controls during the summer, it is extremely unlikely that officials would be prepared to bypass any rules to ease the pressure of queues. The BBC has also learned that the government has told union bosses that they are not prepared to offer any further concessions over pension reforms as a result of the planned strikes. The government recently made what it describes as an improved offer to the unions, promising that public sector workers ten years away from retirement would not see any change to their pensions. It also promised improved accrual rates. Ministers fear that any further concessions would send the wrong signal to financial markets by suggesting that the government was not serious about cutting the deficit and making substantial savings in the public sector pension bill. Ministers argue that public sector pensions have become unaffordable because of rising life expectancy, but they insist that even after the planned changes, state employees will still be better off than the majority of workers in the private sector. Unions say their members are being asked to work longer, contribute more and receive less.",

The Conservative politician was in Scotland a day after the Scottish government published its draft independence referendum bill. He met his Scottish government counterpart Michael Russell for talks. When asked if the First Minister is being \"realistic\" with her demands, he said: \"They are both reserved powers. Immigration and international affairs are both reserved powers.\" Before the EU referendum in June, leading Brexit campaigner and then justice secretary Michael Gove had suggested Scotland could get powers over immigration as part of a deal to leave the EU.

After his first meeting with Mr Davis, Mr Russell said he expected to soon be able to announce a formal process for Scottish input into the Brexit process. Speaking at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Mr Davis said while it has \"got to be a United Kingdom deal\", it would \"incorporate protection for the people of Scotland\". He also said the eventual agreement would \"reflect the interests of the people of Scotland\". Mr Davis stated: \"The aim is to get the maximum possible barrier-free access to the European Union market, as well as being able to get other markets globally. \"How we achieve that? We're not at that stage yet, but that's the aim.\" He continued: \"I don't think the Scottish people want another referendum, but that's for them. \"I have simply got the single aim in front of me, which is to get the best deal possible, and that includes the best deal for the Scottish people.\" Yesterday the Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, said that he thinks the United Kingdom might actually rein back on Brexit.

Here, BBC London's home affairs correspondent Nick Beake answers the most popular. Why don't the unarmed police officers at Westminster have protective body gear, stab- or bulletproof vests? And do they carry Tasers? Nick Beake: PC Keith Palmer was an unarmed officer protecting the Palace of Westminster, but Scotland Yard says he was wearing a protective vest at the time of the attack.

The force said during the post-mortem examination \"the pathologist could find no obvious evidence of damage or penetration other than the vest having been cut off during emergency first aid at the scene\". Armed officers working at Parliament carry a primary weapon, a sidearm and a Taser. And an unspecified number of armed response vehicles - three firearms specialists in an unmarked car - are on constant patrol in central London. Will the pavement safety barriers removed from nearby London Bridge be restored? Nick Beake: The use of safety barriers varies from location to location. The police, local authorities and transport bosses will all discuss where to install extra measures to protect the public. The police, local authorities and transport bosses will discuss. The topic of discussion is extra measures to protect the public. The extra measures will involve installation. The mayor of London's office says it is currently considering where more barriers could be installed. Why not build a 6in [15cm] concrete barrier on the bridge pavements to protect pedestrians from the traffic? Nick Beake: An independent review commissioned by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, last year recommended that more bollards be installed in busy parts of London to protect pedestrians from a Nice- or Berlin-style attack, where lorries were driven into crowds. The report author, Lord Harris of Haringey, also called on the authorities to make more use of temporary barriers during big public events. What is the correct immediate response for members of the public caught up in this sort of attack? Nick Beake: The current terrorist threat is rated as \"severe\", which means an attack is highly likely. The latest advice from the government is to run away from the danger, hide if that is not possible, and then tell the authorities: \"Run, hide, tell.\" More information can be found on the gov.uk website. What should we do if we see something suspicious? Nick Beake: If you spot something suspicious, ring the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789 321. And call 999 if you think there is an immediate threat. How do we know if something that seems suspicious is actually terrorism-related? Nick Beake: It can be hard for experienced police and other investigators to establish quickly if a threat is terrorist-related, but the authorities would rather the public contact them with their genuine concerns however small they may be.

The statement made by the stem cell expert was about cancer treatment. The stem cell expert said this was \"the future\" of cancer treatment. The study, published in the journal Stem Cells, was the work of scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. For many years, they had been researching a stem-cell-based therapy for cancer, which would kill only tumour cells and no others. They had been researching a stem-cell-based therapy for cancer. The stem-cell-based therapy would kill only tumour cells and no others. They used genetic engineering to make stem cells that spewed out cancer-killing toxins, but, crucially, were also able to resist the effects of the poison they were producing. They also posed no risk to normal, healthy cells. In animal tests, the stem cells were surrounded in gel and placed at the site of the brain tumour after it had been removed. Their cancer cells then died as they had no defence against the toxins. Dr Khalid Shah, lead author and director of the molecular neurotherapy and imaging lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said the results were very positive. \"After doing all of the molecular analysis and imaging to track the inhibition of protein synthesis within brain tumours, we do see the toxins kill the cancer cells.\" He added: \"Cancer-killing toxins have been used with great success in a variety of blood cancers, but they don't work as well in solid tumours because the cancers aren't as accessible and the toxins have a short half-life.\" But genetically engineering stem cells has changed all that, he said. \"Now, we have toxin-resistant stem cells that can make and release cancer-killing drugs.\" Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London, said: \"This is a clever study, which signals the beginning of the next wave of therapies. \"It shows you can attack solid tumours by putting mini pharmacies inside the patient which deliver the toxic payload direct to the tumour. \"Cells can do so much. This is the way the future is going to be.\" Nell Barrie, senior science information manager for Cancer Research UK, said it was an \"ingenious approach\". \"We urgently need better treatments for brain tumours and this could help direct treatment to exactly where it's needed. \"But so far the technique has only been tested in mice and on cancer cells in the lab, so much more work will need to be done before we'll know if it could help patients with brain tumours.\" She said this type of research could help boost survival rates and bring much-needed progress for brain cancers. Dr Shah now plans to test the technique using a number of different therapies on mice with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumour in human adults. He hopes the therapies could be used in clinical trials within the next five years.",

The US warned unless Moscow stops bombing. Moscow bombs the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: \"The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. \"Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. \"Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" Mr Kirby said, admitting that \"this is not a decision that was taken lightly\". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: \"We regret this decision by Washington.\" \"Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. \"After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,\" Ms Zakharova said.

Delegates at the Alzheimer's Research UK Conference heard that the University of Nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics.

The test uses proteins. The proteins used in the test are strongly linked with Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid is one of the proteins used in the test. APOE is another protein used in the test. But through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease, as well as those with early-stage memory problems, the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease. Most notably, some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test. Prof Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham said they still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients. But he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising. \"Our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with Alzheimer's using a blood test. \"As blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis, we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future.\" He said there were several ways the test could benefit patients, including giving people a definitive diagnosis, which was not always possible at the moment. It could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment, he explained. Potentially, it could be a \"cheap and easy pre-screen\" test which enabled Alzheimer's to be picked up before symptoms appeared, he said. \"The way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all-clear, or if they are medium- or high-risk. \"If they are medium-risk, they can be monitored closely and high-risk patients can be referred to a specialist for more in-depth testing.\" Dr Eric Karran, director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Giving people with dementia an accurate diagnosis is not always easy, and so building up our armoury of diagnostic techniques is vital. \"While there is still some way to go before a test like this could become available, the results are promising. \"When used alongside other diagnostic techniques, a blood test like this could be a real help.\" A blood test is being used alongside other diagnostic techniques.

Its fuel spokesman, Simon Williams, said retailers had \"no choice\" but to put up prices on garage forecourts. \"The effects of the weak pound have really been felt on the wholesale market, and this, combined with an oil price at nearly double its lowest level in 2016, has put significant upward pressure on wholesale fuel prices,\" he said. \"Certainly, we are a long way from the remarkably low fuel prices enjoyed by families and businesses early in 2016, when the average price of unleaded was around 102p per litre and diesel was 101p,\" he added. According to the RAC, the increases mean it now costs Â£64.20 to fill the 55-litre petrol tank of a typical family car. Meanwhile it costs Â£65.25 to fill up a similarly sized tank in a diesel car.

She defended her credentials, telling one interviewer (in Russian) she had exactly the right experience for the job. She was an aide to an MP, worked for a Swedish energy company and was considered suitably qualified enough to be offered an interior ministry job in 2015. But her promotion to become Ukraine's youngest ever deputy minster unleashed a torrent of criticism. \"I knew that I'd end up in the limelight, that there would be criticism and biased commentary. But I never expected such vile attacks,\" she says. Ms Deyeva's boss, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, is firmly behind her. \"The main thing people have against her is that she's young,\" he wrote on his Facebook page (in Russian), adding that the criticism was based on outdated attitudes. \"In the Soviet tradition, this sort of job was for a monster, but we've hired a girl. Maybe so, only we do things differently in my ministry,\" he said. He is not alone in thinking it is time for Ukraine to move on. \"I am extremely glad that you're one generation younger than me,\" wrote Denis Kazvan, formerly an interior ministry adviser. \"People like you do not need to spend 40 years wandering through the desert to get rid of the Soviet gene of slavery.

Some analysts said the rapid rate of growth that smartphones and tablet PCs had seen in recent years could not be sustained. \"In most of the developed economies, smartphones are at a mature penetration stage and tablets are pretty close to being at that stage,\" said Andrew Milroy of consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan. Mr Milroy added that Apple had so far not been able to replicate the success it enjoyed in the developed economies in emerging markets. He explained that in the emerging economies, Apple products were still very expensive and out of reach for many consumers. At the same time, Apple is facing increased competition from other smartphone makers in those markets. \"They are being hammered by low-cost smartphones in countries such as China,\" he said. The fear is that if Apple's growth rate slows, it will have a knock on effect on suppliers such as Foxconn.",

The vote came a day after the Senate rejected a plan to repeal and replace the health law with a Republican plan. The Senate rejected a plan to repeal and replace the health law. The plan to repeal and replace the health law was Republican. The vote came a day after the Senate rejected the plan. Senators will now consider a \"skinny\" repeal, which would scale back some of the more controversial provisions. The \"skinny\" plan would eliminate unpopular parts of Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act - including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage as well as a tax on medical devices. If that measure passes, the Senate and House of Representatives would then be tasked with finalising a bill that could still change during negotiations. If successful, the full House and Senate would again have to approve the measure. Seven Republicans opposed the repeal-only plan on Wednesday, which included a two-year delay on a replacement in the hope of finding agreement before that time elapses. The defeat is the latest blow for President Donald Trump, who put repealing Obamacare at the centre of his election campaign, and underscores sharp divisions within the Republican Party over a replacement plan. A proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare with the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), a Republican plan that was crafted over last two months, collapsed on Tuesday night after nine Republicans voted against it. Republicans have long railed against Obamacare as government overreach, criticising the system for introducing government-run marketplaces, where premiums have risen sharply for some people. The party's proposed alternative included steep cuts to Medicaid, a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled. And it removes Obamacare's individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. About 20 million people gained health insurance under former President Obama's Affordable Care Act. The non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office (CBO) found the bill would strip 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade. Other attempts to replace Obamacare have failed in recent weeks due to Republican divisions. In an early morning tweet on Wednesday, Mr Trump lambasted Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska for opposing the party's plan, saying she \"really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Mrs Murkowski was one of two Republicans earlier on Tuesday to vote against allowing the debate on healthcare legislation reform to go forward. But her party eked out a victory after Vice President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote which allowed discussion to take place. Senator John McCain, who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour, received a standing ovation as he returned to Congress to cast his \"Yes\" vote. President Trump tweeted his thanks to the Arizona senator for playing \"such a vital role\" in the vote.",

RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the \"cynical and hostile stance from Merseyrail\" left the union \"with no option but to put on this additional strike action\". He said the RMT \"recognises the severe impact that the action will have\" but asked the public \"to understand that we have no option but to take this high-profile action to force the company back to the negotiating table\". Mr Chaudhry-van der Velde said the RMT \"has sunk to a new low\" by inflicting \"a barefaced attack on the reputation of our region\" on \"one of its proudest and most important days of the year\". Merseyrail has \"a range of contingency plans\" which would \"almost inevitably involve using buses to replace trains\", he said. Mr Cash called on Southern to \"get out of the bunker and to start making some progress\". He said RMT members on Southern \"have shown incredible strength and resilience throughout the past year\" and \"have been clear from the off that this is not a dispute about who opens the doors\". \"It is a dispute about a safe method of operation and about the guarantee of that crucial, second safety-critical member of staff,\" he said. A Southern spokesman said: \"We have received no official confirmation from the RMT and will review our response when we do.\" Richard Allan, deputy managing director of Arriva Rail North, said he was \"surprised\" at the move as \"we had been in contact with their officials in the last 24 hours to organise further talks\". David Sidebottom, director of independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: \"Yet more strikes are being dumped on passengers who may have to cancel plans or endure miserable journeys. \"It is vital that all parties in this dispute get back around the table to resolve this matter without bringing the railway to a standstill.\" Up to 2,000 staff at Southern rail, Merseyrail and Northern rail walked out on 13 March in the ongoing dispute but only limited disruption was reported.",

Falling oil prices have hurt Africa's biggest economy, which has contracted for the first time since 2004. As a result of the foreign currency restrictions, airlines have been unable to repatriate up to $600m (Â£417m) in ticket sales, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Foreign currency reserves have dwindled to their lowest level in more than ten years and the government introduced a currency peg last year that has created a black market for the naira currency. \"The inability of airlines to access forex in Africa's largest economy, if not solved, will affect air transport services to, from and within Nigeria and undermine the country's position as West Africa's aviation hub,\" Iata said this week. Iberia said it was leaving Nigeria due to \"very difficult operating circumstances and dwindling passenger numbers.\" Businesses operating in Nigeria are struggling to get their hands on dollars, sterling or euros, says the BBC's West Africa correspondent Martin Patience. The official exchange rate, which is controlled by the government is also very low compared to the black market rate. \"If you take $1, the official rate is 200 naira but if you then go on the black market where you will get the cash it can often cost you double that and airlines...simply can't go on the black market to get business done,\" says Patience.

Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in April and May. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. One incident involved a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care.

He said: \"It shocks and appals me that this situation has been left for so long without an intervention from the Health Secretary, and the way that this has been covered up is nothing short of a scandal.\" During the same inspection, medical care services were rated as requiring improvement.

He said the review had identified \"a significant gap\" in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. The head of the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, Det Ch Supt George Clarke said that following Operation Owl, the PSNI has \"implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep children and young people safe\". \"Indeed, in April of this year, the PSNI formed the Public Protection Branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation. \"The new structures enable us to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more cohesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguarding for children and young people.\" The office said the PSNI has also revised its Missing Persons Protocol, a joint policy with the health and social care authorities. \"This protocol is designed to support effective collaborative safeguarding responses by the PSNI and social services in respect of children who run away or go missing from their homes or care placements and builds upon developments in our knowledge and experience,\" Mr Clarke added.

That was extended early in the second period when Miles Storey's effort found the net via the post before Josh Meekings side-footed a third. Kris Doolan's consolation gave home fans something to clap but Jordan Roberts notched a fourth for Caley.

One of them is Steven Lawless, who should have done better with a left-foot shot that he dragged wide following some combative work by Ryan Edwards. Partick's pre-match guide pointed out that the hosts had not scored a first-half goal at Firhill since 16 January, and it would be the visitors who hit the back of the net in the opening 45 minutes this time round in Maryhill. Inverness broke on the counter attack with just under a quarter-of-an-hour gone and a fine pass by Andrea Mbuyi-Mutombo released Tremarco. Inverness broke on the counter attack. A quarter-of-an-hour gone. A fine pass by Andrea Mbuyi-Mutombo. The pass released Tremarco. At first it seemed the Englishman was not sure what to do as he surged down the left, but he took the correct decision to plough on ahead and send a lovely finish into the far corner with the inside of his left boot. Sean Welsh watched his free-kick well saved by the diving Owain Fon Williams in the Inverness goalmouth soon after. Matters did not improve for the hosts after the break. Matters did not improve. Matters did not improve for the hosts. Matters did not improve after the break. Caley Thistle immediately extended their lead when Meekings found Storey at the right edge of the box. Hands were raised looking for an offside flag but the on-loan Swindon Town man focused on the task of hitting a shot goal-ward and in it went off the far post from a tight angle. The Firhill crowd got even more uneasy when Roberts' close-range effort hit the post following good set-up play by Mbuyi-Mutombo, then Partick goalkeeper Ryan Scully had to pull off a great stop to deny Storey getting his second of the afternoon. When Roberts' low drive narrowly missed the target moments later, the home support unleashed a barrage of boos. Meekings did not miss, however. His controlled side-foot finish from Greg Tansey's corner made it three and very, very easy for Inverness. Doolan did eventually manage to reduce the deficit, rounding Fon Williams after his initial effort was saved, but it did not take long for the visitors to restore their three-goal lead. Richie Foran - who has had so many injury problems over the last two years - came on as a substitute and delivered a cross for Roberts to slam home at the back post and remind everyone which team had been in complete control.",

He said his biggest fear was a fire in one of the nuclear waste silos or in one of the processing plants. The Manx government said it was particularly concerned about \"the structural integrity of ageing waste storage ponds and silos\".

Philip Hollobone said individual fireworks are extremely dangerous. But business minister Jo Johnson dismissed a ban and insisted current laws work well. The debate came after a petition to restrict the use of fireworks attracted more than 100,000 names. The petition, which called for restrictions on when fireworks can be used, was started by Jill Cutsforth, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, and Julie Doorne, from Sleaford, Lincolnshire in a bid to reduce stress and fear in people and animals. But, Mr Hollobone, MP for Kettering, called for the government to go further. He said: \"I think there's great merit in saying all fireworks displays need to be licensed with a licensed operator, and frankly, amateur family-organised fireworks displays in people's back gardens are basically rubbish.\" Labour's Angela Smith, a member of the the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, also backed the petition, arguing that restricting the number of days the public and organised events can set off fireworks should be restricted. She said: \"Ideally, we would end the use of fireworks in back gardens. She said something. The subject of what she said is \"fireworks in back gardens\". The complement of what she said is \"in back gardens\". But I do understand the difficulty in delivering that as policy.\" Instead, she called for tighter regulations to govern how people use fireworks. Mr Johnson acknowledged the concerns raised but said restricting their use to traditional holidays would be ineffective. \"It is likely that those who already use fireworks in an anti-social or inconsiderate way would not be deterred by further regulation,\" he said. He added: \"Restrictions in use could lead to a drop in legitimate sales, leading to job losses not only in the firework industry but independent and associated businesses.\" Bracknell MP Phillip Lee also warned the debate that restricting the number of days that displays are permitted could reduce the viability of well-performing fireworks businesses.

Fire station commander William Weir said five pumps were brought in to bring it under control. \"On arrival the first crews found two houses well alight and the fire spreading either side of them along a row of five terrace houses,\" he said. \"It quickly became apparent that there was an oil tank involved which had allowed its contents to ignite which spread to a second oil tank in the house next door which then further added fuel to quite a large fire. \"The fuel then followed through the gardens of the remaining houses in the street and set fire to a further six garden sheds and some fencing. \"It was quite a large fire and it took crews approximately 35 to 40 minutes of hard fire fighting to stop it spreading to the other properties and to bring it under control and extinguish it.\" Mr Weir said an investigation by the fire service and police had concluded that the blaze had started accidentally. \"Basically what happened was that some rubbish in the garden which had been burnt earlier in the day and left unattended re-ignited and set fire to a fence and then compromised the oil tank allowing its contents to become involved in the fire and from then the fire grew in intensity,\" he added.",

Mr Gove said he made \"mistakes\" in the way he withdrew his support from Boris Johnson. He now had to take the consequences of his decision, including the fact that an act of treachery has become widely known as \"doing a Gove\", he said. The 49-year-old former justice secretary made the comments during an interview with Fern Britton, to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday. He appeared to suggest he had not given up on a return to front-line politics, saying he hoped to \"make a contribution\" in the future. Mr Gove said his decision to back Leave in the EU referendum had placed a \"significant strain\" on his relationship with his long-term friend David Cameron. He and his wife, Daily Mail journalist Sarah Vine, had been close friends with Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha - but the two couples have not had a \"proper conversation\" since the 23 June poll, he said. Mr Cameron quit as prime minister after he lost the EU referendum, sparking a leadership campaign which saw Mr Gove back Boris Johnson. He then changed his mind and decided to run himself, publicly questioning Mr Johnson's ability to do the job.

Experts say a slump in oil prices, cheap steel imports, and China's economic slowdown are to blame. \"We try to play the markets as best we can,\" Harvey Mitchell, the waste services manager for Flintshire, said. \"It makes it difficult when we do have a drop in issues we can't control, such as the global price of oil, or when larger countries flood the European market with steel.\" Flintshire has been celebrating a record year for recycling household waste - up to 58% of everything thrown away now ends up at its waste recover facility in Buckley. \"But while we've seen an increase in the amount of material we've collected, we've actually seen a drop in the income because of the market prices,\" Mr Mitchell said. Recycled waste netted the council £537,000 in revenue in 2015/16, but this represented a drop of 45% in the expected income - more than £400,000 in lost cash.

News of his death disrupted fledgling peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Some senior Taliban leaders had been suspicious of Mullah Mansour's support for peace talks hosted by neighbouring Pakistan, and accused pro-Pakistani circles of installing him as the new leader. Since August Mullah Mansour has overseen a series of battlefield victories, including briefly capturing the northern Afghan city of Kunduz - a huge setback for Western-backed Afghan forces.

The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy tickets that are too expensive for their journey. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) is an organization. The ORR wants train companies to refund passengers. The passengers who are eligible for refunds have accidentally bought tickets that are too expensive for their journey. Train operators said that vending machines were designed for simple ticket requirements. They say plans to simplify fares will help them to give clearer information on ticket machines. The ORR employed mystery shoppers to buy rail tickets from machines. \"Despite investment in new technology and the removal of jargon from ticket machines, our new research shows passengers may be paying more for their journey than necessary,\" said John Larkinson, ORR director of railway markets and economics. \"We are calling on train companies to commit to refund anyone who finds that they could have bought a cheaper ticket for the same journey,\" he added. Rail operators C2C and Scotrail already have a price guarantee in place for when passengers overpay. Earlier this month, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, announced a trial scheme to simplify fares. It said the 16 million fares on offer were \"baffling\" for passengers. As part of the trial, which begins in May, ticket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure they show the cheapest fares available. \"To quickly benefit passengers, the Rail Delivery Group must set out what improvements to ticket machines will be made in the short term,\" said Mr Larkinson. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG, told the BBC that operators were aware that there was a problem with machines, and that they had formulated a 10-point plan to improve them. Yet he pointed out the machines were designed as \"queue-busters\" for passengers with relatively simple requirements, but \"expectations [of passengers] had evolved\". He said that the system of fares was far too complicated. He said that the system of fares was far too complicated. The RDG also added: \"Complex, decades-old government rail fare regulations make it more difficult for train companies to offer the right, simple options on ticket machines. \"Simplifying the number and types of fares in the system will let train companies provide customers with clear information and help them to make better informed choices,\" they added. by Ben Morris, business reporter\nIn the British Rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis. But in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies (Tocs). The Tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them, as it helps them to keep their trains full. To protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off-peak fares. The result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions. Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets, rather than one through-ticket.",

I want it to work for public benefit whether that's economic or environmental or access benefit,\" she said. \"It's my view there should be no reduction in the publicly owned estate and I have asked the Forestry Commission to look at how it can make that estate work harder, provide a better return for the public. \"Whether that's in terms of public access, in terms of environmental benefit in the production of renewable energy or biomass potential or also in terms of the economic return from that forestry estate.\" The minister is due to outline her plans to AMs during Tuesday's plenary session in the Senedd. The minister has plans to AMs. The minister will outline her plans on Tuesday. The minister's plans will be discussed in the Senedd. The minister's plans will be discussed during Tuesday's plenary session. Further commercialisation being planned would include partnerships with the private sector for more forest holidays, wind farms and limited extraction of coalfield methane. Around 37% of Welsh woodland comes under the Assembly Government Woodland Estate (AGWE). A report commissioned by the assembly examined a number of options, including a complete sell-off of the land to the private sector or a not-for-profit trust. It warned there were potential difficulties with both of these, instead recommending that a case-by-case approach should be taken to the future of Wales' forests. Jerry Langford, the Woodland Trust's director in Wales gave a guarded welcome and said the plans were \"considered and enlightened\". \"If these changes do lead to more native woodland creation and a new urgency for the restoration of ancient woodlands planted with conifers, this could be the start of a new 'age of the tree' in Wales,\" he said. Any sell-off in Wales would release resources to the FC to purchase other areas of land not currently under its management to increase their public benefit. Overall, there would be no reduction in the size of the Welsh forests in public ownership. There would be no reduction in the size of the Welsh forests. The Welsh forests in public ownership would not be reduced. The report states: \"The minister agreed that FC Wales should adopt whenever possible a more commercial approach to its management of the estate and in particular to be pro-active and imaginative in exploring opportunities for deeper commercialisation when dealing with the private sector.\" Forestry Commission Wales said it would \"explore the feasibility of small-scale transfer to the third sector on a case by case basis\". A spokesman said: \"This would be subject to proper safeguards being in place to ensure that the woodland continues to be sustainably managed and that it can continue to deliver key benefits such as access for the public.\"",

He has called himself \"Chavez's son\" and said that the late president had appeared to him in the form of a little bird. Speaking last week at the official start of the presidential campaign in the house where Mr Chavez was born, Mr Maduro said a small bird had flown around him three times and looked at him \"oddly\", at which point he he had felt in his soul it was a message from Mr Chavez. \"I felt its blessing, telling us: 'Today the battle begins, go for victory, you have my blessing',\" Mr Maduro said. Henrique Capriles mocked Mr Maduro saying that he had \"not seen a little bird, but swallowed one, the one he has in his head!\" He has also questioned Mr Maduro's ability to lead the country saying that \"whatever the outcome, I don't see how Nicolas Maduro has the capacity to stay for an extended time in government\". Mr Capriles has dismissed polls that suggest Mr Maduro has an unassailable lead over him. \"Of course I can win,\" he told AFP news agency, \"Maduro lacks charisma and leadership\". Mr Maduro said his rival was \"jealous\" and promised to beat him by 10 million votes in Sunday's polls.",

He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike.

        "document": "Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but \"driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be \"less of it\". \"The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. \"People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" he said. He said that people have a right to get housed. He said that people do not have a right to get housed in the very most expensive areas. He said that the right to get housed is not absolute. He said that there are limits to the right to get housed. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This is something that councils can choose to do already. The prime minister's official spokesman made a statement. The statement made by the prime minister's official spokesman was about something that councils can choose to do.

Councils should be looking for ways. Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock. Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. \"They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. \"If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.\" But Labour said the coalition's \"failed\" polices were \"making the housing crisis worse not better\". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: \"Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and \"put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry. He said the government should use a bank bonus tax. The bank bonus tax should be used to fund 250,000 affordable homes. The purpose of funding 250,000 affordable homes is to put unemployed builders back to work. The goal of putting unemployed builders back to work is to boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. \"Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. \"That seems fairer to me,\" he added. The think tank also said the move would be \"extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be \"cleansed\" of \"hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices\". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced \"radical reforms\" to \"get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme \"set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes\". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure \"social housing goes to those in greatest need\", he added.",

It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a \"similar location and mechanism\", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as \"fracking\", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: \"We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts. \"We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that.\" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. The BGS is monitoring fracking. The BGS is doing this as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire. Fracking began in Lancashire in March. The latest earthquake in Lancashire occurred on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: \"Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes. \"It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.\" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: \"The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde. Dr Brian Baptie is the head of seismology at the BGS. The latest quake occurred. The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde. \"Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site. \"Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles). \"The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.\"",

This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. There was another scandal two years later. The scandal was dubbed 'lie-gate'. Hamilton and sporting director Dave Ryan were involved. Hamilton and Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards. The event where they misled the stewards was the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. Dennis insists something. Dennis insists it is only a matter of time. Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success. Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver \"championships, plural\", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

Am I right? If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online: Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker. \"There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,\" he says. \"The chat room is like the foyer of a church.\" Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included: Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons. \"We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,\" says Mr Parker. \"The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.\" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. \"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says. \"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. \"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world.\" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. \"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. \"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\" The message is about Christmas. The message states that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago. However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious\". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. \"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal. \"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. \"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\" As if you needed the excuse.

Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\". Investing Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit. Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. \"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. He said it's all about the money. He said it's not about the people. He added that it's not about the people. \"I thought inspections would be made.\" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\".",

The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: \"I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\" Mayweather posted an Instagram message. The message was about his choice of gloves. The gloves he chose were 8oz Grant gloves. But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. \"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks.

Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. \"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. \"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots.

        "document": "Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a \"very, very important place\" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, \"the Street of Shame\" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. \"I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. \"I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'.\" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. \"There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying.\" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. \"The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time.\" His memories of the street in its heyday are of \"watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers\". \"Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago.\" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of \"certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then\". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. \"At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,\" he says. \"The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards.\" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there. \"Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street. \"But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street. \"When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one. \"Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm. \"The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. The alcohol flowed. The alcohol flowed like water. The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. \"At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool. \"I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him. \"He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'\" But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards.

        "document": "It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. Poorer young people were more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. The likelihood of being placed on statutory supervision was five times higher for poorer young people. The comparison group for poorer young people were their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. People who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be victims of crime. People who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be perpetrators of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: \"Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. \"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. \"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\" A Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. \"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"",

        "document": "It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters. It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences. For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves. The German U-boat is the unseen enemy. The German U-boat is below the waves. U33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships. Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. There have been recent reports. The reports are about Russian submarines. The submarines are off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training \"focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare\". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: \"I wouldn't want to comment on that,\" before adding: \"In general, we're always on the lookout.\" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the \"quietest submarine in the world\". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world\". When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and \"fingerprinting\" other nations' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named \"Dynamic Mongoose\", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters. RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a \"key vulnerability\". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, he says, should be \"exceptionally worried\" that it is seen as a \"soft touch\", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato's readiness. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato's readiness for anti-submarine warfare. But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",

        "document": "United Nations officials rarely use the words \"genocide\" and \"ethnic cleansing,\" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. \"They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,\" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. The children gulped water. The children sat exhausted. The children sat in the shade. The children sat in the shade of a harsh sun. \"They don't want us,\" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. \"These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them.\" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis. The crisis is in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins. \"We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,\" he said. \"It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.\" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. \"This has been unrelenting since July,\" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. \"The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides.\" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. \"War, war, war,\" she began, \"who are you and where do you come from?\" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. \"You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan.\" There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people.

On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers. The network printers were in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. The messages printed by the network printers were pro-Ukrainian. The messages printed by the network printers included insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. \"We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the \"genocide\" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is \"We won't forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.\" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

And she was again visibly emotional after Mr Salmond told the chamber: \"It's goodbye from me... for now\". Ms Marwick, Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May. Mr Salmond, who served as first minister between 2007 and 2014, used his valedictory address to repeat a belief he expressed in his very first speech in the parliament that Scotland was \"not divided, but diverse\". He said both the country and parliament were on a journey, and added: \"Yes we are a country of different views, but we are not divided. There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland. \"And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that\". He welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign. There were lighters moments as Mr Salmond, who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget, joked that he was aware that he faced competition from a \"major attraction down south today\". He then added: \"However, on balance, I feel that the champion chase at Cheltenham racecourse will not be overshadowed by my remarks.\" And the former SNP leader joked that he wished everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck, \"albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm\".

There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country. \"And so with that it is goodbye from me... for now\". Ms Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that he had \"served the parliament and Scotland with distinction\". The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it was established in 1999. Mr McNeil used his address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system. He said: \"It will be this parliament's responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary. \"We must ensure we are capable of meeting that challenge, or we will face the consequences.\" He recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster. But Mr McNeil said: \"It saddens me to say we now have to do a bit of learning from them and how they run their business.\" Former Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood.

Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Confor is an organization that promotes the forestry industry. Confor warns about the loss of commercial forest. At least 16,000 hectares or 40,000 acres of commercial forest have been lost since 2001. The lost commercial forest needs to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. There is a conflict. The conflict is with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy \"sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment\". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as \"sexier\" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. \"There's a huge market for our timber.

Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s.

It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet. \"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. \"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\" The current council tax has many deficiencies.

Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. \"We welcome it, we are ready for it,\" he said. \"We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary.\" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties.

But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. \"We had an agreement with the crown prince,\" he said. He said there was an agreement. The agreement was with the crown prince. \"The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue.\" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was \"hopeful\" that he would \"do more than his predecessor\", Hillary Clinton. \"US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices. We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more.\" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt.

That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. \"So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy.\" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for \"peaceful demonstrations\", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. \"It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government.\" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. \"These people have a lot of followers in the street. If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail.\"",

Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement. The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US. \"Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,\" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said. \"He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director.\" The AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: \"I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing. Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him.\" Speaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3's In Tune, soprano Dame Emma Kirkby said: \"Some of the best players that now lead orchestras all over the world, they started with him. \"Chris was a natural academic, an incredibly clever man.

The US warned unless Moscow stops bombing. Moscow bombs the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: \"The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. \"Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. \"Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" Mr Kirby said, admitting that \"this is not a decision that was taken lightly\". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: \"We regret this decision by Washington.\" \"Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. \"After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,\" Ms Zakharova said.

        "document": "Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but \"driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be \"less of it\". \"The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. \"People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented.

The waiting list for social housing has increased over passing years. \"They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. \"If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.\" But Labour said the coalition's \"failed\" polices were \"making the housing crisis worse not better\". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: \"Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\" Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey made a statement. The statement made by Jack Dromey was about housing. The statement made by Jack Dromey was about the government not forcing councils and housing associations to sell off social homes. The statement made by Jack Dromey was about the potential consequences of selling off social homes, such as breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighborhoods. He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and \"put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. \"Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. \"That seems fairer to me,\" he added. The think tank also said the move would be \"extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be \"cleansed\" of \"hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices\". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced \"radical reforms\" to \"get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme \"set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes\". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure \"social housing goes to those in greatest need\", he added.",

        "document": "It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Hamilton made a public apology. The public apology was humiliating. Ryan was sacked. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. McLaren's F1 history has been a cycle of triumph and decline. McLaren is a participant in F1. F1 is a racing competition. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? McLaren is in a period of slow decline. Some would say McLaren is in terminal decline. Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. Dennis insists something. Dennis insists it is only a matter of time. Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success. Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver \"championships, plural\", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. \"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. \"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious\". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. \"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal. \"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. \"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. There is a Manga for every age. There is a Manga for every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. \"I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,\" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. \"The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.\" \"Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,\" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. \"He was a great communicator.\" Sounds like a seal of approval to me.",

The report was about more than 100 people being detained in Chechnya. The people were detained on suspicion of being homosexual. At least three people had been killed. The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. \"All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya. Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them \"lies\". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that \"retribution\" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April. \"There will be retribution!\" he told the Russian news website RBC. \"Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.\" Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya. \"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue. Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova. But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya. The LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses. If Russia fails to prosecute anyone, it says it will file a case at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.",

The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\". Investing Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house. The letting agent charges housing benefit for each person. The letting agent does not charge based on the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. Investing Solutions operates across seven London boroughs. Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK. The venture is hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. \"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. He said it's all about the money. He said it's not about the people. He added that it's not about the people. \"I thought inspections would be made.\" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\".",

        "document": "The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: \"I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\" Mayweather posted an Instagram message. The message was about his choice of gloves. The gloves he chose were 8oz Grant gloves. But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. \"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Brittle hands.\" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision. McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says he studied a \"litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \"several reasons to approve the fight\". Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. Bennett has an opinion about McGregor. McGregor has a UFC rival named Nate Diaz. Nate Diaz played a role in Bennett's opinion. \"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. \"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer. \"Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself. \"That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\" McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: \"He's good to go.\" He also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said he oversaw an \"out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.",

        "document": "Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a \"very, very important place\" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, \"the Street of Shame\" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. \"I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. \"I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'.\" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. \"There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying.\" The speaker is carrying a torch.

Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. Mr Sherriff is 54 years old. Mr Sherriff has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years. Mr Sherriff became the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. \"The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time.\" His memories of the street in its heyday are of \"watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers\". \"Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago.\" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of \"certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then\". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. \"At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,\" he says. \"The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards.\" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there. \"Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street. \"But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street. \"When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one. \"Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm. \"The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. \"At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool. \"I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him. \"He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'\" But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the \"Stab in the Back\" is a Pizza Express. Now a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline. \"As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,\" says Mr Smith. \"It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history.\"",

Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. The study was conducted by researchers from the University of Edinburgh. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. Girls from poorer backgrounds were more likely to be involved in violent crime. The likelihood of girls from poorer backgrounds being involved in violent crime was twice as high as girls from more affluent households. The study compared girls from poorer backgrounds and girls from more affluent households. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: \"Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. \"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. \"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\" A Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. \"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"",

Sylvia Blackburn suffered serious head injuries. Sylvia Blackburn's injuries occurred outside Bedford Road Lower School. Sylvia Blackburn's injuries occurred in Kempston. Sylvia Blackburn's injuries occurred last December. Brian Wright, 55, of Kempston, told Luton Crown Court he had been blinded by the setting sun. He accepted he had struck Mrs Blackburn but denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Mrs Blackburn is now being treated in residential care.

        "document": "It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters. It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences. For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves. U33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships. Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. There have been recent reports. The reports are about Russian submarines. The submarines are off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training \"focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare\". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: \"I wouldn't want to comment on that,\" before adding: \"In general, we're always on the lookout.\" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the \"quietest submarine in the world\". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world\". When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and \"fingerprinting\" other nations' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named \"Dynamic Mongoose\", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters. RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a \"key vulnerability\". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, he says, should be \"exceptionally worried\" that it is seen as a \"soft touch\", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato's readiness. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato's readiness for anti-submarine warfare. But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",

        "document": "United Nations officials rarely use the words \"genocide\" and \"ethnic cleansing,\" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. \"They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,\" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. \"They don't want us,\" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. \"These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them.\" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis. The crisis is in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins. \"We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,\" he said. \"It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.\" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. \"This has been unrelenting since July,\" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. \"The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides.\" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. \"War, war, war,\" she began, \"who are you and where do you come from?\" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. \"You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan.\" There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people.

The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops are pro-Ukrainians hackers. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops are led by Yevhen Dokukin. Yevhen Dokukin is a Kiev-based programmer. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. \"I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,\" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. \"DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. \"We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the \"genocide\" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is \"We won't forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.\" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

But Mr McNeil said: \"It saddens me to say we now have to do a bit of learning from them and how they run their business.\" Former Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood.

It advertised for a personal assistant with \"a classic look, brown long hair with b-c cup\". The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) called it \"appalling, unlawful and demeaning to women\". Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the EHRC, said it would be writing to Matching Models \"asking for them to clarify their hiring practices immediately\". Meanwhile, women's equality campaigners said its ads were \"straight out of the 1970s\". Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: \"It is extraordinary that they are taking this approach and almost certainly falls foul of equality legislation. \"If we ever wonder why the battle for gender equality hasn't been won, this is a timely reminder.\" The agency's founder Nathalie Jansen said: \"Our clients are important to us - and looks are important.\" Another job advert on the agency's website asks a \"sexy female driver\" to drive a Porsche Cayenne two days a week for between £40,000 and £50,000-a-year for a Knightsbridge-based businessman and polo team owner.

Employment lawyer James Lynas, partner at Winckworth Sherwood, said the advert was \"clearly unlawful\", adding anyone could complain to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who have powers to intervene. He said an employment tribunal could find the use of phrases such as \"beautiful and attractive\" were really code for \"young\", and in reality discriminatory against older women. He added: \"A male driver who genuinely wanted the job could submit an application and sue for sex discrimination if rejected. A male driver could submit an application. A male driver could sue for sex discrimination. A male driver could sue for sex discrimination if rejected. Compensation for such claims is unlimited. \" A statement on the agency's website states: \"It is almost politically incorrect to request someone to work for you that is both attractive as well as professionally equipped with the right set of skills. \"However, our company understands the importance of having the right people representing your company, because after all, first impressions count.\" But Ms Hilsenrath said: \"Matching Models are right about one thing; first impressions count, but the important stuff is not about your hair colour. \"If they wish to maintain their reputation, they should act like a business in the 21st Century and consign this type of sexism to the history books.\" Under the 2010 Equality Act, it is against the law to say, or imply, that you will discriminate against anyone - including saying that you are unable to cater for disabled workers. Employers are also not allowed to question a candidate's age, sexual orientation, marital status, number of children or plans to have children, disability, race or religion. As for specifying clothing sizes, an employer has to be able to show that it is essential to the nature or context of the work. Talking about the personal assistant advert, Ms Jansen said: \"The client who wants the specific cup size is an older gentleman - he has a specific outfit he designed with Christian Dior. He wants a \"Jackie O\" look. And he wants a lady with a smaller cup size to fit into the outfit.\" \"I recently had an Indian businessman who interviewed 60 women from my firm. He wanted a blonde, blue eyed, Greek woman. He hired 6 of them to work on his plane.\" Matching Models clients include MTV, Louis Vuitton, Coca-Cola, the Renualt Formula 1 team and Harrods.

Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. The aim was to reduce the overall cost. The overall cost was of agency staff. The aim was to get hospitals to reduce their reliance on agency staff. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in.

The latest accounts are about NHS trusts. The latest accounts suggested a 10% shortfall for NHS trusts. The shortfall is compared to where NHS trusts wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: \"The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.\"",

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations.

Four out of five children in the study had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas. Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular. Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches. Some parents were questioned. 628 parents had children who ate school lunches. (% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable) England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else. Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: \"Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate. \"School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet.\" Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: \"Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged. \"From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat. \"School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety.\" School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines. About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools. More children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46%. The survey was conducted online between 26 February and 5th March among a panel of parents who had at least one child in school aged 4-17 years old.",

After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining.

Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s.

One-year-old Teenie was found injured by her owner Sarah Nisbett in NiddryView, Winchburgh, at about 16:30 on Friday 14 March and taken to the Scottish SPCA. Mrs Nisbett said the cat was now having to learn how to walk again. \"The gun that was used must have some power because the pellet actually went through her back leg, that's why it was so badly damaged,\" she said. \"She's now learning how to hop around the house, it's terrible. \"The fact that it was three shots is crazy. The statement is about three shots. The statement expresses surprise or disbelief about the number of shots. The statement uses the word \"crazy\" to describe the situation. We live in a housing estate and there are lots of kids. That just makes it worse because any of them could have been hit in the crossfire.\" She added: \"There's some sick people out there, hopefully somebody will know who's done this and let the police or the Scottish SPCA know.\" Scottish SPCA Ch Supt Mike Flynn said: \"Teenie's owners are understandably very upset and keen for us to find the callous person responsible to ensure no more cats come to harm. \"This is an alarming incident which only highlights why the Scottish government should implement the licensing of airguns as a matter of urgency.\" He added: \"The new licensing regime should ensure that only those with a lawful reason are allowed to possess such a dangerous weapon. It will also help the police trace anyone using an air gun irresponsibly.\" Last year the Scottish government launched a consultation on licensing air weapons, with a large majority of those who responded opposing the plan. Under the proposed scheme, anyone wanting to own an air gun would need to demonstrate they had a legitimate reason for doing so. A total of 87% of respondents rejected the idea - with some describing it as \"draconian\" and \"heavy-handed\". A small number of people felt ministers were not going far enough.

Ms Foster said: \"The establishment of a new industry-led agri-food marketing body, which would be similar to the already successful Scotland Food and Drink, will provide a significant and exciting opportunity for the Northern Ireland agri-food industry to work together for the benefit of the entire sector. \"This body will play a pivotal role in providing strategic leadership and direction for the marketing activities of both government and private sector organisations.\" Stormont's Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill welcomed the announcement. \"Agri-food is one of the key sectors in delivering export-led economic growth for the north,\" she said. She said industry representatives had made it clear that there was \"a need for better coordination of current marketing activities\" in Northern Ireland. However, Ms O'Neill added that while the new body was \"clearly a positive step\", the plans could have \"implications for the work of other organisations\", including her own department.

The more algorithms that indicate the student will not send in their work - the higher the chance of that happening. Prof Domingue added: \"We take advantage of the fact that modules are presented many times. One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students.

It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet. \"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. \"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\" The current council tax has many deficiencies.

Many countries add folate to flour. The US, Canada, South Africa, and Australia are examples of countries that add folate to flour. Folate is also called folic acid or vitamin B9. it is proven to reduce the number of babies born with ` ` neural tube defects'' such as spina bifida. one of the original reasons behind this more cautious approach in western europe was the risk that folic acid supplementation could disguise anaemia symptoms in a small number of older people. however, another more pressing concern was prompted by the 2007 study that found the incidence of colorectal cancer, which had been falling in the us and canada, rose temporarily just after the vitamin was automatically added to flour. one theory suggested that folate had boosted the growth of tiny, as - yet undetected cancers or pre - cancers, allowing them to be diagnosed earlier and giving the impression that cancer rates had increased. the lancet study compared cancer rates over a five - year period in 50, 000 people from several countries, some taking a folic acid supplement and some a placebo. the doses of folate tended to be much higher than those proposed for mandatory fortification of flour, but a slight increase in cancer incidence recorded in this group did not reach statistical significance, meaning it could be the product of chance alone. one of the report authors, dr robert clarke, from the clinical trial service unit at the university of oxford, said that the findings were ` ` reassuring''. ` ` if there was a substantial effect, we would expect to have seen it by now,'' he added. he said that while the doses proposed for mandatory fortification of flour were much lower than those in the study, a small proportion of people were known to combine this with extra supplements. he said : ` ` if there is any caution now, this is the group of people involved.'' new restrictions on the availability of high - dose supplements are one possible solution.

F1 has a world champion. Lewis Hamilton is the world champion of F1. Lewis Hamilton is the biggest star of F1. Lewis Hamilton is at war with the media. The media's reasons for the war with Lewis Hamilton are not clear to them. hamilton, trailing team - mate nico rosberg by 33 points in the championship with four races to go, is scheduled to be taking part in the official pre - event news conference in austin on thursday. so there will be an early chance to find out where his head is at when it comes to the latest controversy surrounding the mercedes driver. it is this same event that led to all the trouble in japan two weeks ago, when hamilton spent the half - hour not really answering questions, directing people interested in his views to his social media outlets, and using one of them to post pictures of himself and fellow driver carlos sainz with bunny rabbit and deer faces. then, upset by some of the subsequent coverage, hamilton refused to take any questions at his post - qualifying conference two days later. if nothing else, the furore - if that is an appropriate word for what many may view in reality as one of the more ridiculous media controversies to surround f1 - will guarantee media coverage in the states. and that is exactly what the sport, and this race in general, needs. with austin, f1 in america has finally - after 30 years of trying - found what feels like it could be a permanent home - a place where there is a decent track, an enjoyable location, and people who want to come and watch. so to hear last autumn that the race might not happen this year because of a $ 6m shortfall in state funding seemed at first like it could be yet another example of f1 shooting itself in the foot in a market it has struggled to master despite 60 - odd years of trying. after all, what's $ 6m in the context of a race as important to f1 as this? the problem has been solved by the track hosting a concert by pop superstar taylor swift on saturday night, the idea being to attract fans who might want to see her play and then, hey, why not take in a race - as well as those who might view things the other way round. it's worked, and long may",

On Christmas day, the hugely popular Tianya chat site revealed that the login names and passwords from 40 million of its users had been stolen. All risk being plundered by attackers as the information was held in plain text. Tianya has contacted the affected users and urged them to change their passwords as soon as possible. Soon after, CDSN, one of China's largest forums for programmers, reported that the details of all its six million users had been stolen. The attackers got away with email addresses, login names and passwords. Again, all the details were stored in plain text. The scale of the attacks prompted government action and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it would investigate who was behind the attacks. \"The department believes the recent leak of user information is a serious infringement of the rights of internet users and threatens internet safety,\" the Ministry said in a statement. The Chinese government is known to have put in place technology that monitors online chat rooms for controversial topics but the far-reaching measures have not stopped all nefarious cyber activity.

Kaya Scodelario appeared in series one to four. Kaya Scodelario played Effy Stonem. She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp. Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience. He'd starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002. He has since gone on to play Beast in the X-Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals. Dev Patel's first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two, took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire. He told Newsbeat, he never would have got that role without Skins. \"My career started off because Danny Boyle's daughter was a fan of the show, that is how I got an audition for Slumdog.\" He has two films out in cinemas at the moment, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Jack O'Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand-picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken. The 24-year-old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year's Baftas. Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively.

The makers of Skins were able to spot talented young actors. The makers of Skins used some method or strategy to find talented young actors. Co-creator Bryan Elsley told Newsbeat they made a conscious decision to hold open auditions. \"There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion we decided to go a different way,\" he explained. \"We felt if we had young people playing characters the same age as themselves, and those actors weren't too trained, it would have a more natural feel.\" It sounds quite risky, but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with, they were able to take that approach. Jack O'Connell credits the whole team for the actors' future success. \"I think they knew if they were going to identify that genre, that era, that generation, they needed people on the ground level,\" he said. \"A writing team that understood, they got that right first and then I guess they chose to cast exciting people. \"I feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but I don't think it was a coincidence that we all came through there.\" Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and he thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch themselves that helped nurture their talent. \"They had the opportunity to do properly complex [roles], rather than just two dimensional ones,\" he said. \"It is extraordinary, in the past soap operas had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do their first job. \"That would have been your only break, but time's are changing. \"I think thanks to shows like Skins, unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common.\" Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube.",

Healthwatch England says some patients are being discharged too early and without enough support. Anna Bradley, chairwoman of Healthwatch England, said the findings reflect a troubling picture where patients discharged from hospital often struggle to access crisis treatment at home. \"What is particularly problematic is when people leave institutions, they cannot access the support they need in the community. We have heard of cases where people have taken their own lives.

Latest statistics show a comparison between suicides of patients being cared for at home and inpatients. The number of suicides of patients being cared for at home has been double that of inpatients in recent years. Prof Louis Appleby, chairman of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy advisory group, says the numbers represent a change in the nature of acute psychiatric care, with treatment increasingly being provided outside hospitals. While many patients prefer care at home, it can also represent a risk. \"The ideological drive towards services in the community and away from beds, can go too far. Eventually that drive crosses a line - and that line is safety. If you combine the ideological drive with pressure on resources, you have a toxic combination,\" he said. Graeme Price died after jumping from a multistorey car park in July 2013. He became ill shortly after taking on a new job and was diagnosed with depression and psychosis. He was admitted to an assessment ward at Bedford Hospital but discharged after three weeks back to the care of the crisis resolution and home treatment team. His wife, Linda, said: \"They hadn't done a formal care plan to decide what his treatment should be going forward. They just released him.\" Ten days after being discharged, while on a shopping trip with Linda and his daughter Emily, he jumped to his death. The coroner said he \"required treatment as an inpatient but no bed was available\". South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, which was responsible for Graeme's care said: \"The circumstances surrounding Mr Price's care were thoroughly investigated, robust action was taken to address the issues identified and the learning was shared with clinical teams.\" According to the most recent report from the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, investment in the key community teams set up to replace inpatient care has fallen.

Her annual report notes this is \"significant\" given \"the co-existing reduction in bed availability\". Chris Naylor, of health think tank the King's Fund, said there is evidence that mental health is underfunded compared with physical healthcare, despite recent government promises to ensure parity of esteem. \"Mental health accounts for about 23% of the burden of disease in England, but it only receives around 11% of the funding.

Guaranteeing EU citizens' rights is the top priority for the EU delegation negotiating Brexit.

There is much nervousness among EU citizens living in the UK. Some EU citizens living in the UK fear deportation. Mrs May sought to reassure the UK's 27 EU partners, saying the UK \"does not want anyone here to have to leave, nor does it want families to be split up\". Her Brexit statement took up little of the summit's time. There was no debate as the EU is anxious to avoid any splits emerging. The UK election left Mrs May seriously weakened, heading a minority government, which has fuelled uncertainty about the whole Brexit process. The UK's exit deadline is 30 March 2019. The UK's exit deadline is 30 March 2019. A cut-off date for obtaining \"UK settled status\" is yet to be announced. EU citizens who settle in the UK before Brexit will get a grace period to reach the five-year minimum for residency - but only if they arrive before the cut-off date. There are categories of people whose status may remain unclear, such as children, carers, students and Irish citizens. Ireland has a special relationship with the UK, including a Common Travel Area. The UK is anxious to start negotiating a new trade deal soon, but the EU has already won the argument that its Brexit priorities must be addressed first. As the summit got under way, European Council President Donald Tusk emphasised that the door to the UK staying in the EU was still open. Quoting John Lennon's Imagine, he said: \"You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that as an Anglophile, \"I hate Brexit from every angle.\" \"It is crucially important we know what Britain wants from Brexit,\" he warned. The Netherlands is one of the UK's closest EU allies, with a similar stance on free trade. Mrs May has vowed to take the UK out of both the EU single market and the customs union. But there are many voices - including in her Conservative Party - pressing for a softer approach. \"I hope we'll come to some form of continued [UK] membership or relationship with the internal market,\" Mr Rutte said. \"I absolutely believe the UK will be hit in the economy and the pound very hard.\" Counter-terrorism has also been a key issue at the summit which comes in the wake of an attack in Brussels on Tuesday. Several EU states have been attacked in recent weeks, including the UK, France and Sweden, and Mrs May said that an attack against any member state was an attack on all. The 28 leaders agreed to put legal pressure on internet giants like Google, Twitter and Facebook to remove jihadist content faster and more proactively. Mr Tusk said the bloc was calling on social media companies to do whatever was necessary to prevent the spread of terrorist material and was prepared to pass new legislation. \"This means developing new tools to detect and remove material automatically,\" he said. The EU wants the industry to help tackle the problem of attackers slipping under the radar by using apps with end-to-end encryption.",

During his long rule, President Karimov has built a relatively stable secular regime in a region threatened by Islamist radicalism. But many believe this has been done at the expense of human rights, and has often been an excuse to hound legitimate opposition. It also has not completely eradicated the long-term risk posed by Islamist militancy. Many Uzbek Islamists have simply dodged the tight security at home by fighting for the Islamic State group abroad, but should the secular government weaken, they might be tempted to come back. Some also say that Uzbekistan's fractured and exiled opposition may turn to Islamism to boost its appeal in the majority Muslim country. Positioned on the ancient Great Silk Road between Europe and Asia, Uzbekistan enjoys a strategic location that has attracted the interest of many foreign states throughout its long history. Most recently, it has been one reason why Russia and Western powers have been vying for a foothold. In 2001, Uzbekistan allowed the US to use its air bases in support of military action in Afghanistan, but four years later all foreign troops were evicted following Washington's criticism of the Uzbek government's human rights record. Moscow will be keen to ensure that Mr Karimov's successor leans towards Russia rather than the West. So far, unlike most Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan has been wary of Russian influence. In 2012, it withdrew from the main Russia-led regional military bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Political instability caused by Mr Karimov's demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan's borders. Political instability was caused by Mr Karimov's demise. The political instability was caused by Mr Karimov's demise in Uzbekistan. The political instability caused by Mr Karimov's demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan's borders. The country is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold, and any turbulence may push up the price of these commodities on world markets. Tension could could also spill over into Uzbekistan's energy-rich neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Regional transport corridors may be disrupted, including gas and oil pipelines running to Russia and China. Uzbekistan also supplies electricity to Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and southern Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan lies on key opium routes from Afghanistan to Russia and on to Europe, and drug smugglers could take advantage of instability to distract or disrupt law-enforcement efforts. President Karimov has never been shy of deploying his powerful security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power. President Karimov has a powerful security apparatus. President Karimov uses his security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power. This, among other things, has enabled him to maintain a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country. Should it be upset, the ripple effect may be felt as far away as in China. Uzbekistan hosts a sizeable Uighur community, and the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China has long been seen as a source of concern by Beijing. President Karimov's successor will also inherit unresolved border differences with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

The reconstruction of the event 66 million years ago was made possible by drilling into the remnant bowl and analysing its rocks. These show how the space impactor made the hard surface of the planet slosh back and forth like a fluid. At one stage, a mountain higher than Everest was thrown up before collapsing back into a smaller range of peaks. \"And this all happens on the scale of minutes, which is quite amazing,\" Prof Joanna Morgan from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News. The researchers report their account in this week's edition of Science Magazine. Their study confirms a very dynamic, very energetic model for crater formation, and will go a long way to explaining the resulting cataclysmic environmental changes. The debris thrown into the atmosphere likely saw the skies darken and the global climate cool for months, perhaps even years, driving many creatures into extinction, not just the dinosaurs. The team spent April to May this year drilling a core through the so-called Chicxulub Crater, now buried under ocean sediments off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The team spent April to May this year drilling a core. The core was through the Chicxulub Crater. The Chicxulub Crater is now buried under ocean sediments. The ocean sediments are off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth. Chicxulub Crater is a crater. Chicxulub Crater is the result of an impact. Chicxulub Crater changed life on Earth. The researchers targeted a particular zone in the 200km-wide bowl known as the \"peak ring\", which - if earlier ideas were correct - should have contained the rocks that moved the greatest distance in the impact. These would have been dense granites lifted from almost 10km down. And that is precisely what the team found. \"Once we got through the impact melt on top, we recovered pink granite. It was so obvious to the eye - like what you would expect to see in a kitchen countertop,\" recalled Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US. But these were not normal granites, of course. They were deformed and fractured at every scale - visibly in the hand and even down at the level of the rock's individual mineral crystals. Evidence of enormous stress, of having experienced colossal pressures. The analysis of the core materials now fits an astonishing narrative. This describes the roughly 15km-wide stony asteroid instantly punching a cavity in the Earth's surface some 30km deep and 80-100km across. Unstable, and under the pull of gravity, the sides of this depression promptly started to collapse inwards. At the same time, the centre of the bowl rebounded, briefly lifting rock higher than the Himalayas, before also falling down to cover the inward-rushing sides of the initial hole. \"If this deep-rebound model is correct (it's called the dynamic collapse model), then our peak ring rocks should be the rocks that have travelled farthest in the impact - first, outwards by kilometres, then up in the air by over 10km, and back down and outwards by another, say, 10km. So their total travel path is something like 30km, and they do that in under 10 minutes,\" Prof Gulick told the BBC's Science in Action programme. Imagine a sugar cube dropped into a cup of tea. The drink's liquid first gets out of the way of the cube, moves back in and up, before finally slopping down. When the asteroid struck the Earth, the rocks it hit also behaved like a fluid. An asteroid struck the Earth. The rocks the asteroid hit behaved like a fluid. \"These rocks must have lost their strength and cohesion, and very dramatically had their friction reduced,\" said Prof Morgan. \"So, yes, temporarily, they behave like a fluid. It's the only way you can make a crater like this.\" One of the important outcomes of the research is that it provides a useful template also to understand the surfaces of other planets. All the terrestrial worlds and even Earth's Moon are scarred with craters just like Chicxulub. And knowing how rocks can move vertically and horizontally in an impact will assist scientists as they attempt to interpret similar crustal features seen elsewhere in the Solar System. The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos.",

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. In 2013, the Italian composer was reported as saying he wouldn't work with Tarantino because he \"places music in his films without coherence\". But the 87-year-old told the BBC he had no issues with how the director incorporated his older works into films like Kill Bill and Django Unchained. \"On the contrary, I was very, very flattered,\" he said. \"The fact that my music, which had been written for other films, could be adapted to the poetry of Quentin Tarantino's film-making was a great gift for me. \"The only thing I criticised of Quentin Tarantino was a single scene in a single movie which, for me, was too violent and too ghastly. The user criticized Quentin Tarantino. The user criticized a single scene in a single movie. The user found the scene too violent and too ghastly. I couldn't watch it.\" Speaking through an interpreter, the maestro said his original comments had been mis-reported, adding: \"People should pay a lot of attention when they write something down.\" The pair have now collaborated for the first time, with the Italian maestro penning the soundtrack for Tarantino's upcoming film The Hateful Eight. It marks the first time the composer has scored a Western since his career-defining work with Sergio Leone on films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also a first for Tarantino - who has never commissioned a full orchestral score for one of his films before, preferring to rely on old soundtracks and classic pop records. Morricone says it was Tarantino's dense script that persuaded him to work on the project. Morricone worked on the project. Morricone was persuaded by Tarantino's script. Tarantino's script was dense. Tarantino's script was the reason for Morricone's persuasion. \"It was this thick,\" he says, indicating a document several times thicker than War and Peace. \"He actually came to Rome just to convince me, to my house. \"It was very easy for me to say yes because the script was very, very relevant and interesting and full of detail.\" The Hateful Eight, which is released in January, reunites Tarantino with several of his regular players - Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern - as well as newcomers Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir and Channing Tatum. Set roughly a decade after the US Civil War, it finds an eclectic group of law-keepers, outlaws, mercenaries, bounty hunters and fugitives trapped in a stagecoach waypoint by a massive snowstorm. As the plot unfurls, they begin to wonder whether they'll make it out alive. The score's key movement is a seven-minute suite called L'Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud. \"The main instruments introducing this piece are the bassoon, the contra-bassoon and the tuba,\" he says. \"And this is very strange because I have never done that in the past. \"The sound these instruments produce can express the drama, the rage, the despair and the irony that are the main themes of Tarantino's story. They are a healthy, bodily sound. They also express a criticism towards the leading characters of the film.\" A sinister, brooding passage of music, it will form the centrepiece of the composer's world tour next year, celebrating his 60 years in the film industry. Despite his age - and the lingering pain from a back injury he sustained last year - Morricone says he is \"looking forward\" to the concerts, and finds playing themes from films such as  The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and A Fistful of Dollars an \"incredibly gratifying experience\". The composer has scored more than 500 films, sold more than 70 million albums, scored a top 10 single in the UK (with Chi Mai in 1982) and received an honorary Oscar - but he has no intention of resting on his laurels. \"I've been working for many years and the sum of all these experiences led me always to improve, to do better,\" he says. \"Every piece of work I do adds something to my experience and my style, and brings something new.\" And had he been able to stomach the violence in Tarantino's latest movie? \"The fact I don't like those sequences is not a problem. It's a question of my personal sensitivity,\" he says. \"I would go to the extent to say that maybe he can afford to include those violent sequences because it's part of his poetry. \"The world can be a very cruel place and he has a wonderful way of describing this cruelty.\" The Hateful Eight is out in the UK on 8 January.

Ashworth had a key role in the FA introducing proposals - the 'England DNA programme' - in December aimed at improving England's prospects at major tournaments. The plan is to co-ordinate the style, formation and tactics from the under-15 side upwards. And he believes improvements can be seen already. \"I don't want to hide behind the fact we're devastated to have been eliminated in the group stages,\" Ashworth said. \"We're disappointed with the group that we hoped and thought might go a bit further.

FA chairman Greg Dyke set a target in 2013 for England to win the World Cup by 2022 and Ashworth is adamant that this remains a realistic goal. \"Yes I do believe that,\" he said. \"I genuinely believe we have a lot of good young players in the system. We have the pathways getting better at clubs and international level. \"We've introduced an Under-15s, 18s and 20s in the past 12 months because we recognise we need to give our players more big-game experience. \"You've seen at this tournament we need players who are able to make decisions at the top level in the big games in order to win tournaments.

What a wasted opportunity to gather invaluable international experience,\" the former England captain added on his Twitter page. Former QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who won one cap for England, said the \"culture is rotten\" in English football, and criticised the power of the Premier League clubs. \"There doesn't seem to be the pride there once was at representing England at any level or a major tournament,\" he told BBC 5 live. \"We have a talent pool to match any nation.

It's impossible for England to build good teams. \"The FA should say to them if you don't make yourself eligible for the under-21s, then you won't be considered for the national team for however many years. \"I feel for Dan Ashworth, I feel sorry for Gareth Southgate, I feel sorry for Roy Hodgson. What they are trying to do is so difficult until they get the Premier League back in line.\" Former England defender Danny Mills has been on an FA commission set up to assess potential improvements to English football. He said it could take a decade for major improvements to come to fruition, and also suggested English players earning too much is to blame. \"We looked at this as a commission and decided things needed to change. Gareth has only been in the job two years. Things don't change overnight. Changing the way England play and players develop will take 10 years at least. That's what the Germans had to do before becoming very successful. \"Do they get too much too soon? It's very difficult for the coaching staff.

Mr Gove would not reveal what Mr Johnson said to him when they spoke after he withdrew his support, but he conceded that \"the way in which I declared my stand for the leadership, I shouldn't have done it that way\". \"As I look back on that time, I think that there were mistakes that I made... \"I also think that my initial instinct that I was not the best person to put themselves forward as a potential prime minister, well most of my colleagues agreed.\" After Mrs May entered Downing Street, Mr Johnson entered the cabinet as foreign secretary, while Mr Gove remains on the Conservative backbenches. \"When Theresa May became prime minister she said that she no longer had a place for me in the cabinet and, to be honest, if I'd been in her shoes I would have sacked me too,\" said Mr Gove.

The speaker believes sacking them was the right thing to do. \"I had six years when I was a government minister. I had a chance to make a difference - I hope that I did.\" But he conceded that \"nothing is forever in politics\". \"I have to accept that the way in which I spent the final week or so of my ministerial life involved my making mistakes and having made mistakes you have to take the consequences.\" Mr Gove said he is now focusing on his work on the Commons committee on exiting the EU and wanted to campaign for children at risk of abuse or neglect.

        "document": "They will consider plans by Third Energy to frack a well at a site near the village of Kirby Misperton in the district of Ryedale. Campaigners say approval would set a \"dangerous precedent\". But the company says its operations are no risk to people or the environment. Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into rocks deep underground to unlock trapped gas. The process was banned in 2011 after the shale gas firm Cuadrilla caused minor earth tremors when it fracked a well in Lancashire. Third Energy has licences to produce gas in North Yorkshire and offshore in the North Sea. In 2013 it drilled an exploratory well near the village of Kirby Misperton, close to the North York Moors National Park. It now wants to frack the well to test whether it can unlock shale gas from rocks up to 10,000ft (3,000m) underground. \"All we want to do is test whether gas will flow from an existing well using hydraulic fracturing,\" says Rasik Valand, chief executive of Third Energy. \"What we are planning is safe. There is no risk to the environment or the public.\" But there has been strong opposition to the plan from the local community and environmentalists. Hundreds of anti-fracking protesters are expected to gather outside the council meeting in Northallerton on Friday. The council has received more than 4,000 representations, the vast majority against the proposal. Green campaigners fear that approval here would open the door for fracking elsewhere. \"It risks setting a dangerous precedent for Britain,\" says Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth. \"We strongly urge councillors to reject this planning application which is clearly deeply unpopular with the local community.\" Others are concerned about the impact on the local economy as Kirby Misperton is also home to Flamingo Land, one of Yorkshire's top tourists attractions. \"This place is beautiful,\" says retired bishop, the Right Reverend Graham Cray, who lives in the village. \"The economy is based on tourism and agriculture. The economy is based on tourism. The economy is based on agriculture. Tourists don't come to a gas field and that is what we will turn into if we get the scale of fracking that is intended.\" Last year Lancashire County Council rejected Cuadrilla's plan to carry out exploratory drilling and fracking at two new sites on the Fylde. A planning inquiry into that application took place earlier this year. A recommendation will be sent in the summer to the communities secretary for a final decision. The Third Energy application involves an existing site that has produced gas since the 1990s. The well has already been drilled. The shale gas produced will also be sent through a network of pipes to a nearby power station. That will avoid air pollution caused by flaring gas. So the company expects the fracking activity to be completed within eight weeks. The council's planning officer has recommended that the application be approved. But it is now down to the 11 councillors on the planning committee to take the final decision. That decision may not come until Monday due to the number of people who have registered to speak at the meeting. If approved, fracking could start by the end of the year. The Department of Energy and Climate Change refused to comment on Third Energy's application ahead of the council meeting. But in a statement it said: \"Shale gas is a fantastic opportunity which will create jobs, boost our economy and strengthen our energy security. Shale gas is a fantastic opportunity. \"There is tough regulation in place to ensure that fracking can take place safely - now is the time to start exploration and find out just how much shale gas is there and how much we can get out of the ground.\" You can follow John on Twitter at @JohnMoylanBBC.",

BBC director general Tony Hall set out plans for the next decade, saying the corporation will become an \"open BBC for the internet age\". A children's iPlayer and a pool of local reporters who will share work with local newspapers are also planned. Yet he said funding cuts would mean the loss or reduction of some services. Lord Hall laid out the plans at the Science Museum on Monday, ahead of the BBC's charter renewal in 2016. Citing the importance of \"excellence without arrogance\", he said his plans did not signal \"an expansionist BBC\". He did warn, however, that funding cuts would mean it would \"inevitably have to either close or reduce some services\", without specifying which areas might be under threat. New initiatives will include an Ideas Service, which Lord Hall said would be an \"open online platform\" featuring material from galleries, museums and universities as well as the corporation itself. He said: \"Our new, open BBC will act as a curator bringing the best from Britain's great cultural institutions and thinkers to everyone. He said: \"Our new, open BBC will act as a curator.\" He said: \"bringing the best from Britain's great cultural institutions and thinkers to everyone.\" \"Britain has some of the greatest cultural forces in the world.

We will work with anyone who can help us understand this ever more complex world.\" The government launched a consultation on the BBC's Royal Charter, which sets out the purpose of the BBC and how it will be governed, in July, promising to ask \"hard questions\" about the corporation's size and ambition. Other BBC plans include:. The director general also said he wanted to enable \"producers, directors, writers, artists to have the creative freedom to do things they would find it harder to do elsewhere\". Quality drama will also be a priority, he said, and the BBC will make \"bigger and bolder series\" that will be made available on the iPlayer in their entirety. Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox also announced a science strand named The New Age of Wonder, which will be part of the Ideas Service and will be created in partnership with organisations like the Royal Institution. \"This is not an expansionist BBC\" is perhaps the key political line in today's announcements. This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is \"imperial in its ambitions\" made by Chancellor George Osborne (along with several newspapers). Partnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co-operation rather than competition. The second theme can be seen most clearly in the plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to \"binge\" watch.

The BBC's problem is responding to a technological transformation. It will take money and the BBC has just taken a Â£650m cut. Those \"tough choices\" mentioned in the speech is the theme that has not yet been announced. Lord Hall described the recent agreement by the BBC to cover the Â£600m cost of providing free television licences for over-75s as a \"tough deal\" that would require \"some very difficult choices\" to be made. He said: \"Having already saved 40% of the BBC's revenues in this charter period, we must save close to another 20% over the next five years.\" Details of how those savings will be made and which services might be under threat will be announced in the coming months, he added. In a charter review proposals document published on Monday, however, the BBC suggests that \"some existing services\" might no longer be needed in future. \"Streaming news may replace rolling news,\" the document states. \"Children may prefer iPlay to scheduled television. The Ideas Service might mean we no longer need BBC Four.\" The Ideas Service is a possibility. The Ideas Service might lead to the end of BBC Four. Later in the same document, though, the BBC states \"it is too early to be specific about the service changes that we will need to make.\" The BBC's plans for \"a network of 100 public service reporters across the country\" did not find favour with the Scottish Newspaper Society, who labelled the proposal \"a Trojan horse which will undermine long-established publications and destroy local news agencies\". \"Instead of helping local news publishers, it would make the BBC even more powerful and would further concentrate coverage of news in the hands of the state-funded broadcaster,\" said its director John McLellan. The News Media Association, which represents national, regional and local news media organisations across the UK, expressed similar concerns, saying the corporation's proposals represented \"BBC expansion into local news provision and recruitment of more BBC local journalists through the back door\". \"The local newspaper sector already employs thousands of journalists and is the only reliable source of independent and trusted local news across the UK,\" said its vice chairman Ashley Highfield. \"There is no deficit which the BBC needs to plug.\" \"Under the guise of being helpful, the BBC would end up replacing independent local news services,\" Mr McLellan told Radio 4's The World at One earlier, calling the plan \"a further expansion of the BBC's encroachment\". Yet this accusation was rejected by James Purnell, the BBC's director of strategy, who told the same programme it was \"very much not the goal\" for the BBC to \"take over all local journalism\".",

The practice of communities studying separately has also meant that children grow up without interacting with other cultures. Hong Kong is home to 365,000 ethnic minority people, making up 6% of its total population. Communities of Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese and Filipinos have lived in Hong Kong for generations. But the city still lacks a curriculum for children speaking Chinese as a second language, which would enable them to learn Cantonese, a requirement for many jobs and university places. \"The language requirement that forms a barrier for ethnic minorities to receive equal access in education and the labour market, can be seen as an indirect form of discrimination,\" says Raymond Ho, a senior member of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong. But he is confident that since the government made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of race in 2009, there is more public awareness of the needs of ethnic minorities. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch. In the past there have been claims that Chinese locals are \"less accepting\" of people with darker skin. That was the claim of a report in 2008 from Unison, a group that campaigns for the rights of ethnic minorities. This acceptance level was found to be lowest in the education sector. Language is a major barrier for ethnic minorities to access education. Language is a barrier for ethnic minorities. Language is a major barrier. Language is a major barrier for education access. The best place to start learning Chinese and meeting people of other backgrounds is in kindergarten, says Holing Yip from Unison. But Unison's study Kindergarten Support Report 2015 showed that 62% of kindergartens used Cantonese exclusively as the interview language. It also found that privately-run kindergartens were reluctant to give application forms to non-Chinese parents, and many ask children to have Chinese speaking skills by age three. As a result, there is a concentration of ethnic minorities in a small number of kindergartens. Mr Ho says the Equal Opportunities Commission has been \"encouraging kindergartens to be open to ethnic minorities. Mr Ho says the Equal Opportunities Commission has been doing something. The something Mr Ho says the Equal Opportunities Commission has been doing is encouraging kindergartens to be open to ethnic minorities. But also not to use language ability as a selection criteria\". There has been a pattern of Chinese students enrolling in mainstream primary and secondary schools, where classes are taught in Cantonese. Ethnic minorities would enrol in English-medium \"designated schools\". But the designated schools equipped students with such a low level of Cantonese that they would find it hard to enter university or employment. As such some parents choose to send their children to Cantonese-medium schools. \"Having struggled themselves, many ethnic minority parents want their children to learn Cantonese so they don't go through what they did,\" says Ms Yip. But getting information about how to apply to Chinese-medium schools is often only available in Chinese. Some have discouraged ethnic minority parents from applying. Those who get places can struggle, as all classes are in Cantonese with no extra support in class and parents are unable to help at home. Many parents are forced to seek extra tuition to help children with homework. \"There are situations where if a tutor can't come one day, their children won't be able to hand in their homework and will be penalised. It's also a huge financial burden,\" says Ms Yip. Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani attended both types of schools. \"I learnt more Chinese in the mainstream school where all my friends were Chinese, just by practising it outside of class, than I did at the designated school where I studied Cantonese as a language class.\" After pressure from local non-governmental organisations and the United Nations, the Hong Kong government disbanded designated schools in 2013. But the tendency to send ethnic minority children to particular schools continues. \"Ultimately, parents are faced with the decision of whether their children should suffer now in a Chinese-medium school, or later in the labour market. And that's not a fair choice for a parent to have to make,\" says Ms Yip. In September 2014, the Hong Kong government took a step forward by introducing a \"learning framework\" aimed at supporting ethnic minority students in learning Cantonese. Depending on the number of ethnic minority students enrolled, schools can receive from HK$800,000 (Â£68,000) to HK$1,500,000 to help them. But Prof Kapai is sceptical about its effectiveness. \"It has simply broken the curriculum down into steps, but nothing has actually changed. There needs to be a Chinese as a second language curriculum to teach non-native speakers how to learn Cantonese properly,\" she says. \"Ethnic minorities may still be struggling with subjects such as maths as a result of the class and material being in Chinese,\" says Unison's Ms Yip. Prof Kapai's report emphasises interlinked problems for minority groups. A lack of Cantonese language skills will present barriers in employment, leading to an increase in poverty, and difficulty accessing healthcare. Cantonese language proficiency is a core requirement for some jobs, such as the civil service. Typical occupations taken up by ethnic minorities are in the catering, construction and manual labour industries. The Hong Kong Council of Social Welfare says that many Pakistani, Indonesian and Thai households are below the city's poverty rate. \"I identify as a Hongkonger,\" says Mr Nebhwani. But he is excluded from many jobs because of the limitations of his language skills. \"If I were to try and completely integrate, it would be hard because of my level of Cantonese.\" \"The government is committed to encouraging and supporting non-Chinese speaking students' integration into the community, including facilitating their early adaptation to the school education system and mastery of the Chinese language,\" said a spokesperson for Hong Kong's education bureau.",

It will initially assemble the car in Ebbw Vale - bringing in the V8 engines from Cosworth in Northampton. Former F1 designer Gordon Murray is behind iStream carbon technology to give the new models extra strength. THE HISTORY OF THE TVR. Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent. The automotive industry in Wales already includes 40 component manufacturers and more than 100 other firms in the supply chain. Ford and Toyota have engine plants and Aston Martin recently announced plans to assemble a new model in the Vale of Glamorgan. The Welsh Automotive Forum estimates 18,000 people work in the sector in Wales, with sales worth Â£3.2bn a year. But the impact of the sector is greater than just the number of people working in it. On the whole it's an industry that pays well. On top of that it has to be innovative. It is continually having to improve design and models to make vehicles cleaner and more efficient. Component makers also have to keep looking at the way they themselves work so they keep winning contracts to supply the car makers. As a result, it is an industry that tends to be high on training and big on investment in its people and machines. That means it is of more benefit to the Welsh economy than the same number of workers in other industries. TVR will bring much needed jobs to the Heads of the Valleys and a simplified assembly process, so its factory only needs to be 20% of the size of a conventional plant. It estimates this could reduce capital investment in the assembly plant by around 80%. The first minister would not be drawn on how the Welsh Government had supported the deal. The first minister would not be drawn on how the Welsh Government had supported the deal. But he said the news, hot on the heels of the Aston Martin announcement \"sends out a strong, clear message that Wales is the location of choice for advanced manufacturing\". Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said it showed the Welsh automotive industry was \"surging from strength to strength.\" He added: \"Today's news is yet another strong endorsement of the quality of Britain's car industry, which has been creating jobs, taking on apprentices and contributing to building a stronger economy.\" Although an impression of the new car was released last year, the design of the first new vehicle is still under wraps with plans to unveil it towards the end of 2016, with production starting next year. Circuit of Wales chief executive Martin Whitaker welcomed the news as \"fantastic\" for the region. \"Paired with Aston Martin's recent announcement, it reinforces our vision of Ebbw Vale and the south Wales region growing into a cluster of excellence for automotive and related industries,\" he added.",

It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday \"does not warrant this kind of coverage\" and that the BBC had a \"duty to report, not to celebrate the royals\". Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had \"failed completely\" to report the birthday in a way that was \"fair, balanced and proportionate\".",

        "document": "That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph). And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days. If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\" Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff. Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday's famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real. To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Atletico were in a precarious position in La Liga. Atletico were four points above the relegation zone. Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles. The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes. Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football. For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer. That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks. That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths. Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack. As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space. Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable. More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head. For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up. That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley…who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster. Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort. When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour. As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility. Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\" Robinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be.",

He held talks in Kiev with US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland on Thursday, at which he said he favoured dialogue and compromise with the opposition. Meanwhile, an audio recording has been posted online, which is purported to be a hacked phone conversation between Ms Nuland and US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, in which the female speaker dismisses EU efforts to resolve the crisis, using an expletive.

Thousands of Ukrainian opposition activists, some carrying shields and baseball bats, marched from their camp on Independence Square in the capital Kiev to parliament in a show of force on Thursday. They came close to government supporters who are camped next to parliament behind barricades manned by hundreds of police, but the march passed off peacefully. In another development, a man received a serious hand injury when he reportedly opened a letter bomb inside one of the buildings occupied by protesters in Kiev, Trade Union House. He was rushed to hospital, police confirmed. Mr Glazyev told Kommersant newspaper's Ukrainian edition: \"According to this document [the memorandum], Russia and the US are guarantors of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and, frankly speaking, they are obliged to intervene when conflict situations of this kind arise.\" The memorandum, which also involved the UK, was signed after Ukraine gave up its claim to any part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal after the dissolution of the USSR. Mr Glazyev, who is widely regarded as Mr Putin's chief adviser on Ukraine, gave a wide-ranging interview to Kommersant. He warned that if the opposition did not end its occupation of Independence Square, which is now into its fourth month, President Yanukovych might have no choice but to use force. \"In a situation when the authorities encounter a coup attempt, they simply have no choice [but to use force],\" he said. \"Otherwise the country will be plunged into chaos.\" Accusing the Americans of \"interfering flagrantly and unilaterally in the internal affairs of Ukraine\", he said: \"There is information that within the grounds of the American embassy, there is training for fighters, that they're arming them.\" The speaker accuses the Americans of interfering in the internal affairs of Ukraine.

Russia itself has been widely accused of intervening in Ukraine, using its economic clout to persuade President Yanukovych and his allies to abandon closer ties with the EU in favour of Russia and other ex-Soviet states. The current stand-off in the streets began in November after President Yanukovych refused to sign a far-reaching agreement with Brussels at the last moment.

Uri Geller was very pleased with the end result. He even signed bent spoons for a few of the children who came along to the unveiling. While Mr Geller laid down the challenge of creating a giant gorilla, Clive Knowles, managing director of the British Ironworks Centre, said it had been built for the nation and funded by the firm. He said he was hoping the statue would ultimately live somewhere more accessible to the public and that the firm was in contact with Great Ormond Street Hospital as a possible location. Many of the spoons have been sent from as far away as China, India, Kenya, Tahiti and Armenia. Mr Geller, a friend of Prince Michael, himself donated a spoon once owned by Winston Churchill. Speaking at the unveiling, in front of a large crowd, Mr Geller described the statue as \"an amazing piece of art\". He said: \"This will not raise money for charity. It will do something better. It will amaze sick children.\" \"I am not going to look at the gorilla too hard in case the spoons bend,\" he added. \"It has been an amazing day and Clive has made the impossible possible. Sculptor Alfie Bradley, who has hand-welded every spoon to the statue, said he had been amazed at how the appeal for cutlery had taken off on social media. \"Initially we thought we only needed 5,000 spoons, but it's incredibly hard to calculate and it turned out we actually needed 40,000,\" he said. \"It's been incredibly repetitive, but it's been a challenge.

Mr Bradley added that the gorilla's pose, with one fist breaking out of a cage, had been inspired by the film King Kong. Due to the number of spoons donated by schoolchildren across the world, he said he had come to think of the statue as \"a protector\" of children. Teams from the centre have given presentations at schools in Shropshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire in an appeal for spoons, but the firm soon looked overseas. Mr Knowles said he believed the past five months had cost the firm about Â£120,000 in staff time, but described it as an \"exciting rollercoaster of a ride\".

North Korean hackers have been linked to money-making attacks in the past - such as the theft of $81m from the central bank of Bangladesh in 2016. This sophisticated attack involved making transfers through the Swift payment system which, in some cases, were then laundered through casinos in the Philippines. \"It was one of the biggest bank heists of all time in physical space or in cyberspace,\" says Nish, who says further activity has been seen in banks in Poland and Mexico. The Lazarus group has also been linked to the use of ransomware - including against a South Korean supermarket chain. Other analysts say they saw signs of North Korea investigating the bitcoin method of payment in recent months. The May 2017 attack was indiscriminate rather than targeted. Its spread was global and may have only been slowed thanks to the work of a British researcher who was able to find a \"kill switch\" to slow it down. The attacks caused huge disruption in the short term but they may have also been a strategic failure for the group behind it. Researchers at Elliptic, a UK-based company which tracks bitcoin payments, say they have seen no withdrawals out of the wallets into which money was paid, although people are still paying in to them. Those behind the attack may not have expected it to have spread as fast as it did. Once they realised that their behaviour was drawing global attention, the risks of moving the money may have been seen as too high given the relatively small amount involved, leaving them with little to show for their work. The revelation of the link to North Korea will raise difficult questions about what can be done to respond or deter such behaviour in the future.",

        "document": "Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show 3.7 million workers travel for two hours or longer every weekday. Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress, which published the figures, called on employers to do more to prevent \"excessive\" journeys. The average daily commute lasted 57.1 minutes in 2015, the ONS data showed. Ms O'Grady blamed stagnant wages for bulging commuting times, paired with high house prices and rental costs. \"Employers cannot turn a blind eye to this problem,\" she said. \"Long commutes eat into our family time and can be bad for our working lives too.\" Back in 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more, compared with 3.7 million today, according to the ONS's Labour Force Survey. In 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more. The ONS's Labour Force Survey provides this information. The survey, which is based on responses from nearly 90,000 workers and excludes those who work from home, found that:. The TUC said workers were now less likely to be able to afford to live near their places of work.

The cost of renting a home in the UK rose faster than the cost of living. The cost of renting a home in the UK rose in the year to September. The cost of renting a home in the UK rose according to ONS figures. Meanwhile, UK property prices saw an 8.4% annual increase up to August. Longer periods travelling to and from work have therefore become an accepted part of many people's daily routine. \"It makes life difficult but it's become the norm,\" said Nick Seymour, a solicitor from Exeter, who spends at least three hours a day travelling by car and train to and from Bristol. Once a week, he also travels to his firm's office in Cardiff - a four-hour-plus round-trip. \"I've been doing this for months and am surprised how many people do the same route,\" he said. Mr Seymour, 43, said the Â£5,000 cost of train tickets, not including petrol and parking, was worth it to avoid the upheaval of relocating. \"I am considering moving, but my wife and son are based here in Exeter,\" he said. The compromise is missing out on eight-year-old son Harry's parents' evenings and school plays - not to mention delays and crowded trains. \"It can be a daily nightmare,\" he said. \"I normally stand because it's too busy, which is frustrating if you've had a long day.\" Other commuters are going to great lengths to avoid overcrowded or delayed trains. Phil Cresswell, who works in media advertising, cycles 230 miles a week on his daily journey from Leatherhead in Surrey to central London. He says spending his \"14th winter\" on the bicycle is worth it to save \"several thousands of pounds a year\" on train tickets as well as the cost of a gym membership. \"I live on the edge of the Surrey hills and it's great for cycling,\" he said. Mr Cresswell, 51, admits that some people think the 46-mile round trip is extreme. \"But I think sitting on trains or buses for similar times going nowhere is extreme,\" he said. Another unconventional commuter is Sam Cookney, who recently packed in his own five-and-a-half-hour round trip between Barcelona and London. In a blog post in 2013, he explained that flying from Barcelona for four days a week was cheaper than renting a flat in the capital. Mr Cookney, 33, moved to Barcelona last year but decided making the trip four times a week would be \"excessive\", and instead travelled to London a few times a month. \"Sadly I'm no longer commuting and living back in London,\" he said.",

        "document": "The Premier League hosts huffed and puffed before Divock Origi stole behind the Leeds defence to sweep in Trent Alexander-Arnold's right-wing cross from close range. They secured a place in the last four when Wales Under-19 international Woodburn, aged 17 years and 45 days, fired in the second to beat Owen's record by 98 days. Liverpool hit a post through Georginio Wijnaldum shortly before the opener, but the scoreline was somewhat harsh on the Yorkshire side. Leeds winger Kemar Roofe curled against the inside of a post shortly after half-time. Hadi Sacko spurned a good opportunity for the visitors in the opening 10 minutes, and Kyle Bartley nodded a free header wide after the break. Liverpool will find out who they play in the semi-finals when the draw is made after Wednesday's matches. Liverpool will play in the semi-finals. The semi-finals draw will be made after Wednesday's matches. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp might have claimed his team has \"unfinished business\" in the EFL Cup, but this competition is clearly not the German's priority this season as the Reds chase the Premier League title and a Champions League return. And that has been clear by his team selections. Klopp, like he did in the earlier rounds, rotated his team by bringing in fringe players and a handful of youngsters, though that was forced in part by the absence of Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana through injury. Without that attacking threat, the home side lacked fluency and potency in the final third until they clicked in the final 15 minutes to reach a record 17th League Cup semi-final. However, a laboured night was capped when Woodburn - on as a second-half substitute having made his debut on Saturday against Sunderland - beat Owen's record by 98 days. It was a special moment for the youngster in front of the Kop and former England striker Owen, who was watching from the main stand. Every one of Woodburn's outfield team-mates came to celebrate the historic moment as Anfield saluted their latest star. Matches between these two clubs may be rare in the modern era - but this is a fixture steeped in history. A rivalry born in the days of Bill Shankly and Don Revie, resurrected in the eras of Kenny Dalglish and Howard Wilkinson, consigned to longer memories post-Gerard Houllier and David O'Leary. And it attracted the imagination of both sets of fans, Leeds bringing almost 5,500 to a capacity crowd of 53,000. While this tie did not have the allure of a title-swinging league match or Wembley cup final of previous eras, it did provide an opportunity for Leeds to test themselves again at the highest level. Following a turbulent few seasons under Italian owner Massimo Cellino, there is a cautious optimism among Whites fans that their club may - finally - push for promotion back to the Premier League this season. Manager Garry Monk has provided a calm guidance rarely seen - or allowed - under Cellino's control, moving the club up to fifth in the Championship after four wins in their past five matches. The odds were stacked heavily in favour of the home side prior to kick-off, but the visitors created several decent opportunities against a casual Reds defence. Ultimately, they lost with a fight. But the reception given by the away fans to their players at the final whistle suggests they are optimistic a 13-year absence from the Premier League may be coming to an end in the near future. Leeds United manager Garry Monk:. \"I asked them to play in slightly different way to what we have been doing tactically, which we had to do against a very good side. \"We followed it to a tee. It just lacked us taking one of quite a few opportunities. We had the best chances of the game. \"It needed a bit more composure, that's the only negative. Better decision-making in the final third and we would have had a couple of goals. Overall I was gutted for the players. \"As a performance for a young, inexperienced team these type of nights set a marker for you. We're growing. We are disappointed but they will look back in time and think we have put on a good performance. \"I'm not going to criticise my team - they were excellent.\" Back to a Premier League title push for Liverpool.

        "document": "The legend of Emperor Yu states that he tamed the flooded Yellow River by dredging and redirecting its channels, thereby laying the foundations for the Xia dynasty and Chinese civilisation. Previously, no scientific evidence had been found for a corresponding flood. But now a Chinese-led team has placed just such an event at about 1,900BC. Writing in Science Magazine, the researchers describe a cataclysmic event in which a huge dam, dumped across the Jishi Gorge by a landslide, blocked the Yellow River for six to nine months. When the dam burst, up to 16 cubic kilometres of water inundated the lowlands downstream. The evidence for this sequence of events comes from sediments left by the dammed lake, high up the sides of Jishi Gorge, as well as deposits left kilometres downstream by the subsequent flood. Lead author Dr Wu Qinglong, from Nanjing Normal University, said he and colleagues stumbled on sediments from the ancient dam during fieldwork in 2007. \"It inspired us to connect the next possible outburst flood with the abandonment of the prehistoric Lajia site 25km downstream,\" he told journalists in a teleconference. \"But at that time we had no idea what the evidence of a catastrophic outburst flood should be.\" The Lajia site, famously home to the world's oldest noodles, is known as China's Pompeii; its cave dwellings and many cultural artefacts were buried by a major earthquake. \"In July 2008 I suddenly realised that the so-called black sand previously revealed by archaeologists at the Lajia site could be, in fact, the deposits from our outburst flood,\" Dr Wu said. \"The subsequent investigation confirmed this speculation and showed that the sediments from this outburst flood are up to 20m thick, and up to 50m higher than the Yellow River - indicating an unprecedented, devastating flood.\" He and his colleagues suggest in their paper that the very same earthquake that destroyed the Lajia dwellings probably dammed the river upstream. Less than a year later, the waters returned with a vengeance. The waters returned. The waters returned less than a year later. The waters returned with a vengeance. \"The flood was about 300-500,000 cubic metres per second,\" said co-author Dr Darryl Granger, from Purdue University in the US. \"That's roughly equivalent to the largest flood ever measured on the Amazon river; it's among the largest known floods to have happened on Earth during the past 10,000 years.\" The statement is about a flood. The flood is roughly equivalent to the largest flood ever measured on the Amazon river. The flood is among the largest known floods to have happened on Earth during the past 10,000 years. Using carbon dating - on flood deposits and even on fragments of bone from earthquake victims at Lajia - the researchers date the megaflood to 1,922BC, \"plus or minus about 28 years\", Dr Granger said. If the flood was indeed the source of the Emperor Yu legend then the founding of the Xia dynasty presumably occurred within a few decades, in about 1,900BC. This date is 200-300 years later than many previous estimations. But Emperor Yu's tale is difficult to pin down using traditional historical sources; the story survived as oral history for a millennium and its first known written record dates to around 1,000BC. On the other hand a later, circa 1,900 commencement for the Xia supports that idea that this first dynasty coincided with the transition from Stone Age to Bronze Age ways of living. Some archaeologists have already linked the Xia dynasty with the Erlitou culture, an early Bronze Age society known from digs elsewhere in the Yellow River valley. Dr David Cohen from National Taiwan University, another co-author, said the study was remarkable because of the multiple lines of evidence involved. \"We have the geological evidence of just a huge outburst flood, which is incredible in itself,\" he said. \"But then there's this coincidence of it co-occurring with the destruction of the Lajia site - which is able to give us very, very precise datesâ€¦ and then that this flood was of such a scale and corresponds in time, and along the Yellow River, with both the beginnings of Bronze Age civilisation and the legend of the great flood itself. \"It's just this amazing story. All these different approaches coming together - it is just great luck.\" Prof David Montgomery of the University of Washington is a geomorphologist with an interest in what rocks can tell us about ancient myths and legends. He was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary for the journal and discussed the findings on the BBC World Service programme Science in Action. Among the world's various flood myths, Prof Montgomery said, Emperor Yu's story is an odd one. \"It's not about surviving. His basic story is about draining the flood waters; it's about river engineering.\" The story is about draining flood waters. The story is about river engineering. The case made for the Jishi Gorge megaflood is a plausible one, he said, particularly because it describes a flood that would have broken the Yellow River's banks far downstream and re-routed its flow. Prof Montgomery said this is just the sort of event that would take decades to deal with - and a long battle with the waters is a feature of the Yu myth. \"It's very difficult to ever actually prove the origin of pre-written history events. But they've made a very interesting case, that I'm sure geologists will continue to poke at, and investigate, and argue about - because that's what we do.\" At a purely geological level, he added, the flood is a major and intriguing discovery. \"But the cultural connection - possibly explaining the origin of the Chinese flood story - is too intriguing to ignore.\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter.",

The world number two inspired Great Britain to win the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years with victory over Belgium in Ghent over the weekend.

After returning from the Shanghai Masters in October, Murray said he arrived at the National Training Centre in London to find no other players present. \"I was there on a Monday at about 3pm and then on Tuesday, at the same time,\" he said. \"There was not one person using any of the indoor courts and not one person in the gym.

        "document": "As defence correspondent of the Daily Express he beat his rivals to a string of scoops. One of his great strengths was the ability to remember minute details without having to make a single note. After his retirement he published a series of books alleging Britain's security services had been penetrated by spies at the top level. Harry Chapman Pincher, son of an Army officer, was born in India on 29 March 1914. Harry Chapman Pincher was born on March 29, 1914. Harry Chapman Pincher was born in India. Harry Chapman Pincher was the son of an Army officer. He went to Darlington Grammar School and London University, and graduated  in zoology and botany. Ironically while at university, some fellow students tried to sign him up to the Soviet cause. \"I said to one: 'In the event of a successful revolution, how would the new England be governed?' \"He said: 'To start with it would be governed from Moscow.' \"So I said: 'Well, bugger that.'\" Pincher worked as a teacher before joining the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943. After the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor. One of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme. He wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it. \"I'm up for use any time,\" he said. \"If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!\" But it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle. His investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things. His favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster. Only after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.) \"MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it,\" he said. \"All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know. \"'It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy.\" Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside. Pincher cultivated contacts. Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table. Pincher cultivated contacts in the countryside. In the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse. Lord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting. \"He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his.\" In 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's Â£5 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences. This was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than Â£4 million to the Treasury. In 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies. This prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability. After his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. Pincher retired. Pincher wrote a book called Their Trade is Treachery. Their Trade is Treachery is controversial. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy. There was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying. In the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole. Not everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor. Rupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. \"Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service. \"Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963. \"Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole.\" One of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication. Margaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher. In May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked \"secret\", to his minister of defence. \"I do not understand,\" he wrote, \"how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher? \"I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters.\" And the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967. What became known as \"the D notice affair\" began with a \"walk-in\", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop. The information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ. Before publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee. The D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published. Lohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop. Wilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express. In his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations. He said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed. \"I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay,\" he said. \"When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.\"",

For four seasons, viewers have seen her in the role of Claire Underwood, the Machiavellian partner of stop-at-nothing politician, Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey. Both actors have also directed and produced episodes of the show. But while their roles are equally prominent, for years their salaries were not in parity. \"I was like, 'I want to be paid the same as Kevin.' It was a perfect paradigm and example to use, because there are very few films or TV shows where the male—the patriarch and the matriarch are equal. And they are in House of Cards,\" she told an audience at New York's Rockefeller Foundation. Wright looked at statistics which showed that for some time, her character was more popular than Spacey's. \"So I capitalised on it. I was like, 'You better pay me or I'm going to go public…and they did.'\" Wright's success at equalising her pay is a story to be noted, because it is still incredibly rare. \"She is playing a popular and important character in a series. She has leverage and she used it,\" says Lisa Maatz, vice president for government relations at the American Association of University Women (AAUW), which has conducted research into the broader issue. \"I admire her for standing up to them. Not everybody is going to be as fortunate. But her situation in terms of being underpaid is far too common.\" US government statistics show that on average, women are paid less than their male counterparts, 79 cents for every dollar a man earns. According to the White House, the median wage of a woman working full-time all year in America is about $39,600 (£27,116), 79% of a man's median earnings, which stand at $50,400. The statistic is widely used to illustrate the discrepancy in pay across the sexes, and looks across all sectors. In Fresno, California, Aileen Rizo took a similar stand against her employer after she learned she was receiving less pay than a new male employee, who didn't have a masters degree like she did. Ms Rizo had been working as a maths consultant for four years for Fresno County Office of Education, when she found out that the new hire was being paid at the highest salary scale (a nine), while she was being paid at the lowest (a one). When she confronted her human resources department about the difference, she was told it wasn't a mistake. \"They said they'd used my prior pay as a guide, and that's why I was on less,\" she explained. Ms Rizo began legal action against her employers in 2013, who argued they set wages based on the employee's most recent salary, plus a five percent increase. Experience wasn't a determining factor, they said. Representatives for Fresno County pointed out that a woman working in the same department as Ms Rizo, was being paid more, and said that in the past 25 years more women had been on higher salary scales, than men in the same or similar position in the department. The court ruled in Ms Rizo's favour, arguing that the fact another woman earned more than her, shouldn't diminish her right to a fair wage. Her employers appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing. Since she began her lawsuit, Ms Rizo is now receiving the same pay as her male colleague, but she continues to fight for backdated wages. Ms Rizo began a lawsuit. Ms Rizo is now receiving the same pay as her male colleague. Ms Rizo continues to fight for backdated wages. She also testified before the California legislature, which has since passed an Equal Pay Act in the state. While she believes employers need to be more transparent and fair, she does also think women could also do more. \"We do need to get better at negotiating. I was trusting an organisation to act in a way of integrity. I took for granted that that's where everyone started.\" \"Whether you have to file a lawsuit or demand it and get it, women need to empower others and educate society about a problem that's still evident,\" she says. But the scale of the problem is something which is widely debated. Some critics say the \"79 cents for every dollar\" statistic is misleading, because it doesn't compare two people working in the same job, with the same background and qualifications. When those factors are taken into account, there still is a gender pay gap, but the percentage difference is much smaller, at around 7%. \"The idea that when a young woman graduates, the idea she's going to get paid 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, working in the same job, across our economy is a myth,\" argues Karin Agness, who is president of the Network of Enlightened Women, a conservative policy group. Ms Agness believes that the 79 cents statistic gives young graduates a false impression of the workplace they're about to enter. \"It creates a victim mentality in women, and we don't want our young women going into the workforce thinking they are victims just because they are women,\" she says. But Lisa Maatz from the AAUW says both measures are valid - one is more general, the other specifically compares similar roles - but both point to a discrepancy which needs to be addressed. \"The gender wage gap has many causes and contributors, including differences in education, experience, occupation and industry, and family responsibilities. But even after accounting for these factors, a gap still remains between men's earnings and women's earnings,\" argues a White House report on the issue. Data on the pay gap for Hispanic and black women shows greater disparities. The gap between similar jobs fluctuates wildly based on the sector. And even controlling for similar jobs, the gap grows for women who are promoted into the director and executive level. For Ms Maatz, there are other areas which also need to be addressed when it comes to wage disparity, for example the rise of so-called \"pink collar\" jobs, in which certain roles such as nurses, secretaries and teachers, are devalued simply because more women do them. But Robin Wright's experience is a reminder that the gender pay gap affects women across all professions. Robin Wright is a woman. Robin Wright has experience. The gender pay gap affects women. The gender pay gap affects women across all professions. She hopes her example will encourage other women to speak up. \"It's a male dominant workplace society. It always has been.

One of the few women to receive a mention is Marie Curie, a physicist and chemist who basically discovered radiation and helped apply it in the field of X-rays. She won two Nobel Prizes, in physics and chemistry. She won two Nobel Prizes. She won the Nobel Prize in physics. She won the Nobel Prize in chemistry. Yet even so, she was turned down for membership of the prestigious French Academie des Sciences in 1911, the very year she went on to win her second Nobel Prize. The Nobel laureate Sir Tim Hunt was heavily criticised for his disparaging remarks about women in science last week, which for some raised the issue of where women stood in the scientific community. The larger truth is that women have made big and important discoveries in science - think of Dorothy Hodgkin, the brilliant crystallographer who mapped the structure of penicillin and went on to be awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964. Hodgkin was the first woman to win the prestigious Copley Medal, and she remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in the sciences. Yet at the time, the newspapers carried headlines such as \"Oxford housewife wins Nobel\". But many female scientists in the past were not given the credit they deserved for their achievements. As a result, their names have all but disappeared from public consciousness. Here are just a few. Esther Lederberg, a microbiologist, conducted groundbreaking research in the field of genetics. She developed basic techniques that have gone a long way towards helping scientists understand how genes work. Her work helped her husband, Joshua, win a Nobel prize in 1958, but she was not cited in the award. The British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering X-ray crystallographer. Her image of the DNA molecule was critical to deciphering its structure - one of the biggest and most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century - but it was James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins who received the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work. Ida Tacke made huge advances in both chemistry and atomic physics. It was she who managed to find two new elements, rhenium and masurium, that Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted would form part of the periodic table. She gets credit in the science books for the discovery of rhenium. But masurium is now known as technetium, the discovery of which is attributed to Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre. Tacke's evidence was ignored until Perrier and Segre artificially created the element in a laboratory. Tacke is also credited with being the first person to open up the idea of nuclear fission. Lise Meitner's work in nuclear physics led to the discovery of nuclear fission - where atomic nuclei split in two. This laid the groundwork for the atomic bomb. After moving to Berlin in 1907, Meitner collaborated with chemist Otto Hahn over many decades. But Hahn published their findings without including Meitner as a co-author. And he went on to win the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to splitting the atom. Chien-Shiung Wu was one of the most important physicists of the 20th Century. She participated in the development of the atom bomb, as part of the Manhattan Project. Yet few know her name today. In the 1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, asked Wu to help disprove what is known in physics as the law of parity. Wu's experiments turned this law on its head. This landmark moment in physics led to a 1957 Nobel Prize for Yang and Lee, but not for Wu, who was left out despite the key role she played. Another neglected pioneer is the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt, who helped change the way we see the universe. She began her work by measuring and recording stars at the Harvard Observatory - one of the few jobs in science that was considered suitable for women. Leavitt spotted a pattern between the brightness of a star and its distance from the Earth. This led her to uncover what is known as the period-luminosity relationship, allowing scientists to calculate how far away a star was from Earth based on its brightness. The Royal Society - swift in its condemnation of Sir Tim's remarks - was founded in 1660 and has yet to elect a female president. It represents the scientific establishment in the UK, and its early members included Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Women were not permitted to become fellows until 1945, almost 300 years after its foundation. Some say that the comments from Sir Tim - a prominent fellow of the society - will damage the efforts it is making to improve diversity. It has been reported that only 6% of its fellows - a prestigious title in the world of science - are women. That statistic, some say, sums up the scale of the wider problem of the difficulties faced by women in the scientific world.",

The Wisconsin primary on Tuesday marks the beginning of the Democratic presidential campaign's endgame. The Wisconsin primary is on Tuesday. The Wisconsin primary is part of the Democratic presidential campaign. The Wisconsin primary is the beginning of the endgame for the Democratic presidential campaign. More than half the pledged delegates have already been apportioned, and only a few truly landscape-altering battlegrounds - New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California - remain on the calendar. Mr Sanders can claim momentum, with wins in five of the last six contests, but he needs a sizeable victory in Wisconsin if he wants to properly set the stage for the critical coming contests and cut into Mrs Clinton's 263 delegate lead. It's enough to set both candidates on edge. On Thursday, when confronted by a Greenpeace activist in New York about whether she could address climate change while taking donations from the fossil fuel industry, Mrs Clinton showed a rare flash of anger. \"I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me,\" she said. Her campaign would later assert that the former secretary of state, like Mr Sanders, takes donations from individuals employed in the energy sector but is prohibited from accepting money from corporations. It was a moment of emotion for a usually carefully controlled candidate - and the Sanders camp quickly responded. \"If the Clinton campaign wants to argue that industry lobbyists giving thousands of dollars to her campaign won't affect her decisions if she's elected, that's fine,\" Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver said. \"But to call us liars for pointing out basic facts about the secretary's fundraising is deeply cynical and very disappointing.\" It was just one of numerous recent shots between the two campaigns. When Mrs Clinton unveiled manufacturing proposals on Friday, a Sanders spokesperson said the former secretary of state has embraced \"policies that have decimated the manufacturing industry ... and eliminated millions of jobs across the country\".

At a campaign event, Mr Sanders offered criticisms of Mrs Clinton's six-figure speeches to Wall Street firms, her foreign policy views and her position on environmental issues, as his supporters heartily booed. On Saturday Mrs Clinton noted that she has been a \"proud Democrat my adult life\" - drawing a contrast with Mr Sanders, who is a self identified \"democratic socialist\" who serves in Congress as an independent. \"I think that is kind of important if we are selecting someone to be the Democratic nominee of the Democratic Party,\" Mrs Clinton said. \"I think the secretary is getting very nervous,\" Mr Sanders countered on Sunday, noting that polls show him doing better than Mrs Clinton against Republican front-runner Donald Trump. \"I think we've got a lot of young people's vote, working-class people's vote,\" Mr Sanders said. \"I think we're on the way to a victory if we can win the Democratic nomination.\" The speaker is expressing optimism. The speaker is referring to a victory. The victory is related to the Democratic nomination. This tension in the Democrat race is a relatively recent development. There is tension in the Democrat race. The tension in the Democrat race is a relatively recent development. Last autumn, Mr Sanders famously said during the first debate that he was \"sick and tired\" of talking about Mrs Clinton's email server imbroglio - passing on a chance to target what could have been a key weakness in his main opponent. When Mr Sanders entered the race, he said he wasn't interested in running a negative political campaign. It was a strategic decision that has led to some recent second-guessing among advisers within the candidate's campaign, as witnessed by a surprisingly pessimistic story in the New York Times on Monday. \"The central complication with Bernie is that he never wanted to cross into the zone of personal attacks because it would undercut his brand,\" Sanders adviser Tad Devine told the Times. That hasn't stopped acrimony from flaring among the two candidates' supporters, however - even in typically restrained states like Wisconsin. Lisa Stubek, a state representative who endorsed Mrs Clinton early in the campaign, says she's caught fire from pro-Sanders constituents in the ultra-liberal state capital of Madison. \"Bernie Sanders supporters are pretty relentless, unfortunately, as far as their support and as far as attacking those who support anyone but their candidate,\" she said. \"And that's not true of everyone, but certainly there is a core group of Bernie Sanders supporters here in Madison who do that.\" While Ms Stubek says that the campaign has largely been above-the-board, things have taken a turn for the worse. \"I think certainly when you have Bernie Sanders out there stretching the truth or out-and-out lying, things do heat up,\" she said. \"I'm glad that Hillary is out there defending her record. More than anything people in our state want the facts.\" Another Madison-area Democratic representative, Melissa Sargent, says she decided not to endorse a presidential candidate in part because the noise between the two candidates would drown out her efforts to address other issues and local campaigns. \"When I go to doors and I'm stumping for my local candidates, I can talk about the things that I want to talk about and I can hear authentically what folks are saying,\" she said. \"It felt like I wouldn't be able to navigate the path that I am with these other races.\" Democrats in Wisconsin are quick to note that their challenges are nothing compared to what the Republicans are facing, as their two leading candidates engage in harsh negative attacks and exchange barbs over their wives and marital infidelity. Brett Hulsey, a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders, called the Republican campaign a \"food fight circus\". \"Democrats are still fighting by the Queensberry Rules,\" he said, drawing a boxing analogy. He cautions that while tempers seem to be flaring among Democrats at this point, things will eventually calm down. If Mrs Clinton wins, he plans to support her - and he predicts most Sanders backers will follow suit. \"We're in the middle of the fray right now,\" he said. \"I remind everybody to take a few deep breaths and remain calm. I've worked every presidential since 1980 for Jimmy Carter. I've seen this movie before.\" At a rally in Madison on Sunday night it seemed an era of good feelings may have returned. Mr Sanders spoke to a crowd of 4,200 for more than an hour and made no mention of his Democratic opponent. Instead, he focused his criticism on Mr Trump and Republican Governor (and former candidate) Scott Walker. He also seemed to be broadening his perspective. \"This campaign is about more than just electing a president of the United States, although I would very much appreciate your support,\" he said. \"It's about creating a political revolution.\" After the event, Jess A Weber - who had travelled to Madison from Illinois to volunteer for the Sanders campaign - said she appreciated that Mr Sanders has tried to run a positive campaign. \"He continues to pull focus back to the message and back to our strength in unifying, coming together instead of dividing and bringing anyone down,\" she said. On the campaign trail in Janesville on Monday, however, Mr Sanders was back to swiping at his opponent for her past positions on international trade and commerce. \"I have voted against and led the opposition to every one of these disastrous trade agreements,\" Mr Sanders said. \"Secretary Clinton has supported virtually every one.\" The Democratic race is far from a bare-knuckle fight, but the candidates aren't done trying to draw blood.",

The charity Sightsavers, which works in more than thirty countries to try to eliminate avoidable blindness, says it is seeing a rise in conditions such as cataracts, where the eye's lens clouds over. \"Due to an ageing population and a rise in chronic disease, we expect the burden of blindness to only grow within the world's poorest countries\" said Imran Khan from the charity. He said health systems in developing countries need to be improved, and more surgeons and nurses need to be trained to deliver sustainable eye health care.",

The other candidates for the post were Martin Skelly with 22 votes while 20 went to Robert Frost. This weekend's annual congress will be dominated by new championship proposals in football and hurling. The plans put forward by GAA director general Paraic Duffy include completing the All-Ireland Senior Championships by the end of August. Also included is a new round-robin format for the All-Ireland SFC quarter-finals, which would mean more games. This proposal has proved particularly controversial in recent weeks. Both the Gaelic Players' Association and recently formed Club Players' Association have come out against Duffy's plans, although not necessarily for the same reasons. Ostensibly, the main reason for these mooted changes is to try and ensure more regular games for club players but there is a certain  amount of bafflement as to how this can be squared with the motion to have a round-robin stage in the All-Ireland Football quarter-finals. The new club players' body has been angered after the GAA's top brass refused to grant it a speaking platform at the Croke Park gathering. The new club players' body is angry. The GAA's top brass refused to grant a speaking platform. The speaking platform was at the Croke Park gathering. However, that may change at further annual gatherings of GAA delegates if a motion for the club players' body to be officially recognised is passed in Dublin. All the indications are that the votes on both the so-called new 'Super Eight football round' and the proposal to bring forward the All-Ireland finals will be exceptionally close, with a two-thirds' majority required for the format changes to be tried for a three-year period. To make matters even complicated, congress will also hear a number of motions calls from the two-thirds majority to be scrapped, with one call suggestion a simple majority and another calling for the figure to be lowered to 60%. Inevitably, those motions will require a two-thirds majority to be passed. Going into the weekend, Croke Park's desire for replays to be scrapped - in favour of extra-time - in all championship games bar provincial and All-Ireland finals looks likely to be comfortably passed. At last year's congress, motions to move All-Ireland Finals to earlier in the year and scrap replays were both defeated, although the finals proposal fell narrowly short after getting support from 60.8% of delegates.",

        "document": "The choice of a running mate is one of the most crucial decisions a candidate will make during a presidential run. He is looking for a number two who can balance his weaknesses, appeal to new voter constituencies, persuade independent voters to give him a second look, and campaign effectively on his behalf. All the while, Mr Romney will need a partner who will not outshine him on the stump or otherwise detract attention from him. The perfect VP pick will also need to convince voters he or she is ready to assume the presidency if anything happens to Mr Romney - to be just a heartbeat away from the Oval Office, as the American political adage goes. As Mr Romney nears a decision, here are some of the top possibilities:. Paul Ryan, 42, has made a name for himself as the top Republican on budget issues, calling for a dramatic reduction in entitlement programmes and other government spending and in taxes. The Wisconsin congressman, chairman of the House Budget committee, is seen as a persuasive surrogate with the capacity to take the Romney campaign on the offensive on issues that are likely to dominate in this election year - such as jobs, the economy and the deficit. He is also a staunch conservative from a state that both parties consider to be up for grabs in the coming election. Since becoming chairman of the House Budget committee in 2007, Mr Ryan has worked on shaping an alternative vision for the federal budget. But Mr Ryan's budget proposals are seen as so severe and conservative that they could pose a problem for Mr Romney among independent voters less keen to slash taxes and cherished social programmes. Mr Ryan studied at Ohio's Miami University and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998 at the age of 28. He is currently serving his seventh term. Rob Portman, 56, is a veteran of Washington, having served in the House of Representatives for 12 years and in White House roles under both Presidents Bush. In selecting him, Mr Romney would hope to pick up votes from the crucial battleground state of Ohio, while also having a competent veteran of Washington on the ticket. But Mr Portman's strengths are also his weaknesses. Often portrayed as dull, he brings little excitement and pizzazz to the ticket. His years in Washington would detract from Mr Romney's effort to run as a political outsider. And his role in the second Bush White House could turn off both independent voters and hard-core fiscal conservatives angered by Mr Bush's expansion of government spending and his widening of the federal budget deficit. Mr Portman was born in Cincinnati and educated at Dartmouth College and the University of Michigan law school. Later, he worked in legal roles in George Bush Sr's White House. He served in the US House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, when George Bush Jr appointed him US Trade Representative. In 2006, Mr Bush appointed him director of the Office of Management and Budget, a role in which he helped formulate White House budget and tax policy. He left that job in 2007. In 2010 he was elected to the Senate, succeeding Republican George Voinovich. Tim Pawlenty, 51, is seen as a \"Sam's Club Republican\" for his supposed appeal to working and lower-middle class voters (Sam's Club is a chain of giant discount stores run by Wal-Mart). Mr Pawlenty made his own brief run for the Republican nomination, but quit the race in 2011 before a vote was counted when he failed to gain traction with voters or the media. He could help balance Mr Romney's wealthy, patrician image and certainly brings enough political experience to the table. Currently without a full-time job, he has been an effective surrogate for Mr Romney on the campaign trail, and the men get on well personally. But he is seen as lacking charisma, and he does not bring to the ticket a geographic constituency - Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, having last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 1972, and before that, in 1956. Mr Pawlenty has also broken from current Republican orthodoxy on a number of issues, including on energy and environmental policy (although he later renounced his backing for \"cap and trade\" plans), and with a call for universal health insurance for children. Mr Pawlenty grew up in a family of modest means in South St Paul, the son of a trucking company worker. He studied law at the University of Minnesota and was elected to the state House of Representatives from a suburban district in 1992. He rose in the state House, winning the role of Republican majority leader in 1999. In 2002, he was elected governor. He was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential running mate to John McCain in 2008. He was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential running mate. He was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential running mate to John McCain. John McCain was a politician. The year of the possible vice-presidential running mate was 2008. Marco Rubio, 41, is everything Mr Portman and Mr Pawlenty are not: He is young, handsome, energetic, and a gifted and engaging public speaker and television presence. He is a darling of the conservative populist Tea Party movement, giving him a grassroots appeal Mr Romney's other options lack. The son of Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio could conceivably dent Mr Obama's overwhelming advantage with Hispanic voters. And he could help carry the crucial state of Florida for the Republican ticket. But Mr Rubio also brings drawbacks. At 41, he is younger than Mr Obama was in 2008, and he has less experience on the national political stage than the president did when he launched his run for the White House. When Mr Rubio was young, his family briefly attended a Mormon church, which would risk alienating some evangelical Christian voters already suspicious of Mr Romney's Mormon faith. And it is unclear the extent to which Mr Rubio could win Hispanic votes from the Democrats. The majority of Hispanic Americans have a Mexican background and are unlikely to identify with a Cuban American merely because they speak the same language. Mr Rubio, a lawyer by training, was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000 and rose through the leadership to become House speaker in 2008. In 2010 he was elected to the US Senate. Bobby Jindal, 41, was the first Indian American elected governor. In choosing him, Mr Romney would hope to broaden his appeal beyond non-Hispanic white voters - or at least soften the party's image among independent voters. Mr Jindal is a die-hard social conservative and is leading the Republican governors' charge against President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. Those attributes could win Mr Romney support on the Republican right-wing. Mr Romney is a Republican. Mr Romney has attributes that could win support on the Republican right-wing. Mr Jindal is also fiercely intelligent, attending Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar. Mr Jindal's first foray into national politics fell flat - he was chosen to give the Republican rebuttal to Mr Obama's 2009 State of the Union address - and he was dismissed as not quite ready for prime-time. His national profile subsequently rose in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when he positioned himself as a bold leader in dealing with the disaster and a critic of the Obama administration's response. Before entering politics, he worked briefly for consulting firm McKinsey and Company in Washington DC. While in his mid-20s he was appointed to lead the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, and soon was running the national Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.

John Thune, 51, has been seen as a giant-killer by fellow Republicans since he ousted the Senate's Democratic majority leader to claim his seat in the chamber in 2004. The two-term Senator has become a familiar face on US talk shows and is a prolific fundraiser within the party, using extra cash from his own coffers to bolster the campaigns of other Republican Senate candidates. Mr Thune's staunchly conservative voting record, especially on social issues, could be an asset for Mr Romney, who has struggled to convince his party's base that he is conservative enough for them. In 2010 Mr Thune toyed with the idea of running for president himself but ultimately decided not to, saying in February 2011 that he preferred to serve in the \"trenches\" of the Senate. Mr Thune is the son of a Norwegian immigrant and hails from Murdo, a small South Dakota town west of the Missouri River. He studied at Biola University in California and the University of South Dakota's business school. He served in the House of Representatives from 1997 to 2003.",

The bass guitar-playing, foreign policy hawk has had a media career since losing the nomination in 2008. He joins a crowded Republican field that includes three senators, a businesswoman and a neurosurgeon. \"Folks, it is a long way from a little brick rent house on Second Street in Hope, Arkansas to the White House,\" he said. \"Here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe that where a person started didn't mean that's where he had to stop. I always believed that a kid could go from Hope to higher ground.\" After announcing his ambitions, the crowd erupted in cheers of \"We want Mike!\" The former Southern Baptist minister acknowledged his pro-gun-ownership position, telling the audience about receiving a BB gun at the age of five. He said the US Department of Education should be abolished, a position popular with conservatives who oppose recent national education reforms. On immigration, he said the US borders should be secured, but was short on details. And he reaffirmed his steadfast opposition to same-sex marriage. Mike Huckabee is back. Mike Huckabee is a person. Mike Huckabee is back. Eight years ago he launched a surprisingly successful presidential bid, finishing second to Arizona Senator John McCain and winning the Iowa caucuses and seven other states. Four years ago rumours abounded that Mr Huckabee was going to run again. Supporters and analysts watched and waited...  and waited. The former Arkansas governor, who had a well-paying job as a television and radio host, opted to sit out the campaign, despite some polls showing him leading the Republican field. He said his \"heart says no\". Now, however, Mr Huckabee's heart is saying yes. He has quit his media commitments and is diving into the 2016 race. He'll meet a much more crowded field than would have faced him in 2012, however, both in the total number of candidates and in opponents who will compete with him for the evangelical voters who buoyed his 2008 campaign. Mr Huckabee has a lot going for him - name recognition, a developed fundraising network and experience from his previous presidential campaign. But given the strength of his Republican opponents - new, engaging and also well-funded - will that be enough? Early in his speech, Mr Huckabee noted that he was the first male in his family to graduate from high school. \"My dad wasn't an educated man, but he was a smart man. And he and my mother didn't have a whole lot, but they had honesty to the bone,\" he said. As his campaign gets under way, Mr Huckabee could face challenges within his own party. Many conservatives will not like the fact that overall, taxes and spending went up during his time as Arkansas governor. In 2008, Mr Huckabee won eight primaries in socially conservative states but this time he has vowed to focus more on the economy and national security. To win the Republican crown, he will have to overcome Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, as well as former Hewlett-Packard boss Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Jeb Bush has not officially announced but is the frontrunner in the party.",

He told the jury: \"As far as Mrs Vasco-Knight is concerned, she has fallen a long way, hasn't she, but that is her responsibility.\" Vasco-Knight was CEO at the South Devon NHS Foundation Trust and the national lead for equalities for NHS England when the offence occurred. The newsletter was commissioned by her in April 2013 and produced by her husband's firm Thinking Caps that July, the court heard. But it was a \"sham\", cut and pasted from a research paper by the Kings Fund charity, said Gareth Evans, prosecuting. He said Vasco-Knight's failure to declare an interest in Thinking Caps was a criminal offence and a \"massive breach of trust and abuse of her position as chief executive\". Vasco-Knight later tried to blame Habib Naqvi, a senior manager in the NHS, for commissioning the newsletter. Mr Naqvi, 28, of Bristol, was cleared of two counts of aiding and abetting. The prosecution offered no evidence on the second fraud charge against Mrs Vasco-Knight of swindling £9,000 from the NHS. The prosecution offered no evidence. The second fraud charge was against Mrs Vasco-Knight. The amount of money involved in the fraud was £9,000. The money was swindled from the NHS. She and her husband were released on bail to 10 March for sentencing. Sue Frith, managing director of NHS Protect, which conducted the investigation, said Vasco-Knight's meteoric career path had been \"an inspiration to so many\" and her fraud was a \"huge disappointment and shock to many\".",

        "document": "Sergeant Randy Johnson, 34, was killed in an explosion near Baghdad in 2007, Woolwich Crown Court heard. The fingerprints of Anis Abid Sardar, from Wembley, London, were allegedly found on two other bombs at the scene, but not that which killed Sgt Johnson. Mr Sardar, 38, denies murder, conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the court: \"This is an unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence you will see and hear comes from Iraq. \"The Crown's case is that the defendant Mr Sardar was directly involved in making bombs for use in Iraq during 2007. The Crown's case is about making bombs. The bombs were for use in Iraq. The bombs were made during 2007. The defendant Mr Sardar was directly involved in making bombs. \"As you will hear, he seems to have been based in Syria, probably in the capital city Damascus at relevant times.\" He explained that although the offences took place in Iraq, Mr Sardar is on trial in London as a British citizen. Mr Hill said the bombs \"were not off-the-shelf bombs, they were made with deadly intent\". They were later taken to an FBI laboratory in the US for examination by experts. Sgt Johnson, of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, was killed when the armoured vehicle he was travelling in hit a roadside improvised explosive device (IED). Other US soldiers were seriously injured by the blast and also in a fire-fight while dealing with another IED, the court heard. Fingerprints found on the bomb that killed Sgt Johnson belonged to another man, Sajjad Adnan, who worked with Mr Sardar, the prosecution said. Mr Adnan, who is not British, was handed over to the Iraqi authorities after the bombings and his current whereabouts are unknown, Mr Hill said. Jurors heard Mr Sardar was part of a group that left a number of IEDs buried under the roads west of Baghdad. The bomb that killed Sgt Johnson was part of a sequence, Mr Hill told the court, \"involving bombs concealed geographically quite close together\". Mr Hill said the bomb series was part of a  \"joint effort by the defendant Mr Sardar, together with Adnan and others\". \"That is why it is unnecessary for Mr Sardar to have left his own finger mark on the bomb which killed Sgt Johnson,\" he said. The prosecution made clear that this was an \"unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence... comes from Iraq.\" Nevertheless it is, according to them, lawful to try Anis Sardar here because he is a British citizen who lives and works in London. It is the first time we have seen a prosecution in this country for charges of making improvised explosive devices (IEDs) during the insurgency in Iraq. This has been a case a long time in gestation, since Mr Sardar was arrested seven years after the bombs were recovered from a dusty road west of Baghdad. The jury was told they were forensically analysed by the US authorities in Iraq and America before being examined by British scientists. The jury was told about forensic analysis. The forensic analysis was done by the US authorities in Iraq and America. The forensic analysis was examined by British scientists. Though Mr Sardar claimed to have travelled to Syria in 2007 to learn Arabic, the court heard that police found documents in his London home which suggested he already had an advanced understanding of the language. Police searching the property also found a bomb-making manual written in Arabic. The US-led invasion of Iraq began in 2003, amid claims Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. It sparked years of violent conflict with different groups competing for power. British forces ended combat operations in 2009 and the US did so the following year.

The party had previously said it would not vote on issues affecting England and Wales only. Mr Cameron said the SNP's position was \"entirely opportunistic\". Downing Street said it was \"disappointing\" that the vote had to be postponed, and said new proposals on the Hunting Act would be introduced \"in due course\". The government has said the hunting vote will now be held after plans to give English MPs a veto on matters affecting only England - although this would not stop the hunting issue having to be voted on by the whole House of Commons. Ms Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, said the decision to delay the hunting vote showed \"David Cameron can't carry his own parliamentary group\", and that he only had a \"slender and fragile\" majority. Ms Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, made a statement. The statement made by Ms Sturgeon was about the hunting vote. The statement made by Ms Sturgeon was critical of David Cameron.

David Cameron was making Scottish MPs \"second-class citizens\" in the House of Commons. Mark D'Arcy, BBC Parliamentary correspondent. With two strategic retreats in the space of a week, the intersection of Hunting and English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) is generating some really interesting politics. Last week, the government paused its attempt to bring in EVEL, replacing a vote on Wednesday with a consultative debate. Today another \"turn your back and run away, and live to fight another day\" moment on the proposed changes to the Hunting Act. Read the blog in full. The government plans to change Commons rules to allow English, or English and Welsh, MPs a \"decisive say\" on legislation only applying there. However, the current proposals would not prevent SNP MPs from voting against the changes. Downing Street said there were no plans to change the current proposals. This is because the statutory instrument ministers want to use to change the law would require the support of the whole of the House of Commons. The government's decision to reschedule the vote came as anti-hunting protesters gathered at the Houses of Parliament to protest against changing the law. The changes would have brought the Hunting Act in line with Scotland, where an unlimited number of dogs can be used to \"flush out\" a fox to be shot, compared to just two in England and Wales. It's been a rollercoaster week for the old, bitter enemies on each side of this debate. Last Wednesday - Budget day - there was quiet jubilation in hunts in England and Wales at the prospect of the loathed Hunting Act being relaxed. Dignity would be restored: they could hunt without their every move being filmed. Animal welfare groups were devastated: it was a sneaky step, hunting would be back, and they only had a week to mobilise. Now with the abandonment of the vote, their fortunes have apparently been reversed. But this isn't a tale of victory and defeat. Both sides now know the government's desire to change the Hunting Act. They are digging in for a much more protracted fight that could - believe it or not - become even more bitter. But the 56 SNP MPs, plus Labour and some Conservative MPs opposed to hunting, meant the government's change stood little chance of being approved in Wednesday's free vote. The SNP says it will now consider tightening the law in Scotland to match England and Wales.

Lord Amherst's connection is with biological warfare. Earlier this year students at liberal arts institution Amherst College, Massachusetts, voted to remove 'Lord Jeff' as their unofficial mascot in light of accusations he approved the wiping out of Native Americans by deliberately giving them smallpox via infected blankets.

Jeffery Amherst was the commander-in-chief of the British army. Jeffery Amherst was in pre-independence north America. Jeffery Amherst had an enemy. Jeffery Amherst despised and hated his enemy. Jeffery Amherst's enemy was the British army. In a postscript to a fellow British officer Henry Bouquet, he appears to have written: \"You will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race. \"I should be very glad your scheme for hunting them down by dogs could take effect, but England is at too great a distance to think of that at present.\" Other higher education institutions including the University of Cape Town and Oxford University have faced student protests because of their association with another colonial figure, the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. The 'Rhodes Must Fall' campaign led to UCT removing a statue of the 19th Century politician. Professor Elizabeth Fenn, an historian at the University of Colorado, who researched the Amherst smallpox incident told the BBC: \"I am relieved and delighted to see the wholehearted rejection of Jeffery Amherst. \"He advocated genocide, the 'total erxtirpation' of native peoples. The question we should ask is why did it take us so long?\" In Montreal more than 6,500 people signed an online petition to rename the city's Amherst Street after a former Premier of Quebec Jacques Parizeau, who died in 2015. The campaign, launched that year, continues. Some researchers have argued that the British general deserves an honourable position in history for his personal achievements, one of which was the capture of Montreal in 1760. Morse Stephens wrote: \"Though not a great man... his personal qualities were undeniable, and he could not have been an ordinary man to have risen from page to Duke of Dorset to be field-marshal commanding-in-chief.\" Whether Sir Jeffery Amherst ever visited Guernsey during his time as governor of the island is not known, but his legacy lives on today in several places; Amherst Primary School, Amherst Road and the Amherst Room at Castle Cornet. There was an Amherst Maternity Hospital in St Peter Port but the site was redeveloped for housing. Local historian, Colonel Richard Graham, said that Lord Amherst had been viewed as a national hero \"in whose reflected glory Guernsey bathed over the 24 years of his time in office\". So have recent events overseas had any bearing on the general's reputation in Guernsey? Mr Graham said historical figures like Jeffery Amherst should be judged by the standards of their time.

As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23% - told the pollsters they would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56% - also said they would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. More than half of SDLP supporters (56%) would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. SDLP supporters are the subject of the statement. The statement is about the preferences of SDLP supporters regarding the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. David Cameron is the Prime Minister. David Cameron said the survey should lift the spirits of those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. The survey is for the BBC Spotlight programme. The survey is about the potential outcome of a border poll. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers itself \"Northern Irish\". That posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified themselves as \"Northern Irish\" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72% to just 7%. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that his party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make this a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. The Spotlight survey is mentioned. The Spotlight survey suggests something. The something suggested by the Spotlight survey is that the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97% Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99% Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99% Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92% Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51% Protestant backing and 36% Catholic support. Alliance's support for a \"designated days\" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party's offices and a death threat against its only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44% backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35% wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10% told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2% opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73% of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64% of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made its decision in early December. This result may reflect some people's belief in the right to protest, even if they don't back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. They told the pollsters this was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business. Although the Stormont politicians might take heart from this shift of opinion, the protest organisers will point to the fact that by late January 45% of unionists still believed the demonstrations should continue. This shows a degree of resilience given the barrage of negative publicity generated by the protests. The poll was carried out for the BBC Spotlight programme by Ipsos Mori, whose researchers interviewed more than 1000 adults at 64 locations across Northern Ireland between 17 and 26 January. The full details are available as a pdf, 897kb in size. They include findings on how people rated individual politicians' handling of the flags crisis, which parties those interviewed support and whether those surveyed believe the Stormont system favours one community over another.",

Some 70% of respondents said they were either \"living comfortably\" or \"doing okay,\" up from 69% the year before, and 62% in 2013 when the Federal Reserve started the survey. But there were continuing signs of instability, with over a third of US households (35%) saying they could not cover their monthly bills or an unexpected $400 (Â£307) expense, according to the survey. The survey also suggested that disparities between households with different education levels was growing. Gap between rich and poor 'keeps growing' Enriching the rich in the US - but what about the rest? \"A clear pattern over the past two years across these measures is that the improvements have been most pronounced among those with greater levels of education,\" researchers wrote in the report. Nearly 100 million Americans have no education beyond high school, according to US government estimates. (The estimate excludes members of the military and people in institutional facilities such as prison.) That fact is tied to wide differences, the survey found. About 46% of adults with at least a college degree reported family incomes of $100,000 or more, compared to just 9% of respondents with a high school degree or less. Adults with at least a college degree were more likely to report earning money from online activities - such as renting out properties using a website - and more likely to have a steady stream of income from month-to-month. Adults with at least a college degree were more likely to report earning money from online activities. Online activities include renting out properties using a website. Adults with at least a college degree were more likely to have a steady stream of income from month-to-month. They were also more likely to say they received a raise in the last year, and more likely to say it exceeded the growth in their expenses. \"The thing is that earnings are so highly correlated with education and employment,\" said Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. \"It's hard to imagine how a sense of financial wellbeing would not be correlated with education.\" Jobs in sectors that once supplied well-paid work for school leavers,  such as manufacturing, have fallen. At the same time, the overall labour market has become more unstable as employers cut back on benefits and pay rises. The share of Americans in the workforce is also shrinking - particularly among those with lower levels of education, said Valerie Wilson, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \"The workers we would expect to have the strongest labour attachments have actually been becoming less attached,\" she said. Among survey respondents who did not attend college, nearly 40% said it was too expensive or that they needed to earn money. Their status was also closely tied to whether their parents had attended college. But Ms Baum said simply getting everyone to go to college is not the solution. \"There could be more work done to equalise things at the level of higher education but the problem is never going to be solved just at the college level,\" she said.",

Political factions in Lebanon have often defined themselves as pro- or anti-Syrian. By Jim MuirBBC News, Beirut. Given how deeply and sharply Lebanon is divided over Syria, it's a miracle that there hasn't been much more violence than there has. But the killing of two Sunni clerics at a Lebanese Army checkpoint in the north of the country on Sunday could hardly pass without consequence - though the fallout could have been much greater. Only in Beirut did the tension break into open conflict. The tension broke into open conflict in Beirut. And it was restricted to a clash between Sunni groups, with the mainstream Future faction of Saad al-Hariri using the occasion to squeeze out the small, pro-Syrian Arab Movement Party, whose leader Shaker Berjawi fled. In nearby areas of south Beirut, Hezbollah - the most powerful force in the land - kept well out of it. Political and religious leaders from all sides urged restraint, while the government pledged a vigorous enquiry into the death of the two shaikhs. Divisions over Syria are the defining issue in Lebanese politics. Divisions over Syria are an issue. The issue is in Lebanese politics. Everybody knows how real the danger is that the country would be torn apart if those differences are allowed to erupt freely onto the streets. Sunday's violence was triggered by the shooting dead of two Sunni sheikhs linked to the anti-Syrian Future movement, headed by opposition leader Saad al-Hariri, at a Lebanese army checkpoint in the north on Sunday.

But a BBC Inside Out West investigation has found evidence of alleged abuse involving different staff members. Police have agreed the assault on Ben Pullar was \"not acceptable\" but said they would not re-open the case. Mr Pullar is autistic and bi-polar, with severe learning difficulties, and when he was 18, he spent almost a year at Winterbourne View from July 2009. He lost two teeth when he was punched in the face. He lost two teeth. He was punched in the face. His twin, Tom, said his behaviour changed drastically after going to the hospital. \"He's burst out crying on me and demanded to talk about Winterbourne View - and this is two years after Winterbourne View - so it still affects him today,\" said the 21-year-old. The BBC has seen daily care notes from his time at the hospital which state Mr Pullar \"had an accident with his teeth\" just weeks after he arrived. His family said they were given mixed messages about what happened and were told at one point he had \"bitten the floor\". He was taken to Bristol Dental Hospital by Winterbourne View staff as an emergency patient, and two doctors there raised the alarm with the authorities because of the severity of his injuries. Senior dental consultant Dr Jane Luker said: \"I think they thought the injury he sustained wasn't consistent with what they were being told. \"He had allegedly bitten a carer and the injuries were sustained from him biting that carer. \"[But] because the teeth were pushed back palatally, towards the back of the mouth, it would be consistent with a punch or a blow to the front of the face.\" The authorities met several days after Mr Pullar was assaulted, but his family was not invited. The authorities met several days after Mr Pullar was assaulted. Mr Pullar was assaulted. Mr Pullar's family was not invited to the meeting. Tom Pullar said: \"I think that care staff are supposed to care for patients, not punch them.\" Notes obtained by Inside Out said the nurse was bitten and retaliated in order to remove his fingers - and later, that he had pushed and pulled to get them out. The nurse involved, Maxwell Nyamukapa, was suspended and later reinstated. Despite repeated attempts to contact Mr Nyamukapa, he has refused to comment. The police logged it as an assault, and said the nurse had acted instinctively and in self-defence. Forty concerns were raised about patients in just over three years with the local safeguarding board run by South Gloucestershire Council. The police were also contacted 29 times, nine of those times related to carers suspected of using restraint of involved in violent incidents with patients - including Mr Pullar. Det Ch Supt Louisa Rolfe, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: \"We have carried out an extensive investigation into incidents at Winterbourne View and no stone has been left unturned. \"We consulted with the CPS and our partners in terms of action we could take. \"Looking back on that incident now and understanding the whole pattern of what was happening at that residential hospital, it is clearly not acceptable.

Castlebeck, the hospital's owner at the time, said its new board and management had already, and would continue to, rigorously review what happened at Winterbourne View.

It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The PDP's decline has been reinforced. Results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies. Reports from the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi. From the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Elections were not held. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja. The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue. It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory. Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Nigeria has 36 governors. Nigeria's governors enjoy wide powers. Nigeria's governors are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.",

But when the subject came up in the interview, the IJR said: \"He was so cagey when Russia came up, for example, that his answer wasn't even worthy of inclusion.\"",

Anti-abortion groups have condemned the result of the vote. Any change to the law would require a referendum. The Citizens' Assembly was set up by the Oireachtas (Irish Houses of Parliament) to advise elected representatives on a number of ethical and political dilemmas facing the Irish people. These include abortion, climate change and how the Republic of Ireland deals with the challenge of providing for its aging population. The body is made up of 99 members who were chosen at random to broadly represent the views of the Irish electorate. Its most controversial task was to consider a campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution - which gives an equal right to life to a pregnant woman and an unborn child. Assembly members held 10 days of intensive and emotive debates over the past five months, culminating in this weekend's series of votes. On Saturday, members voted against repealing the Eighth Amendment, but they did support change - voting to amend or replace the law. On Sunday, a majority of Citizens' Assembly members approved 13 separate grounds for legal terminations in the Republic of Ireland.

Teaching unions have accused Ofqual of \"regulatory failure\" and say it is more evidence of flawed exam marking. Teaching unions have accused Ofqual. Ofqual is accused of \"regulatory failure\". Teaching unions say it is more evidence of flawed exam marking. But the regulator insists it applied its measures correctly. It comes as state and private school heads call for an independent inquiry into the problems. Last week Ofqual said it felt the way this year's English GCSE exams were graded was fair, despite the  grade boundaries being moved significantly part-way through the year. Teachers have complained that pupils achieving exactly the same marks would have received different grades depending on what time of year they sat the exam. And many who were predicted a grade C, obtained a grade D in their summer exams. Ofqual found that June's grade boundaries were correct, while January's were \"too lenient\". A key document sent to exam boards, which is on the Ofqual website, sets out how it expects exam boards to use a process known as \"comparable outcomes\" to ensure that grade standards are maintained between GCSEs year-on-year. It sets out five conditions for when such processes should be used to alter the way papers are marked. The conditions are related to when processes should be used. The processes are related to altering the way papers are marked. According to the TES report, this year's English GCSE and the circumstances around it failed to meet four of the conditions. The TES report is about English GCSE. The TES report says that this year's English GCSE failed to meet four of the conditions. The circumstances around this year's English GCSE are mentioned in the TES report. The first of Ofqual's five conditions was that the cohort - or pupils from that year- in a subject \"must be similar, in terms of ability, to those of previous years\". But last week's report on English GCSEs noted that the \"attainment profile\" for 2012 dropped, as grammar and independent school pupils were replaced with extra, lower-achieving comprehensive pupils. The second condition was that the qualification must be \"fit for purpose\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament that this year's English GCSE was \"not fit for purpose\". The third condition was that the \"nature of the qualification\" must be the same. Ofqual's report last week stated that \"these qualifications are different from previous English qualifications in a number of ways\". Finally, the regulator said in the letter that comparable outcomes must only be applied where \"previous grades were appropriate\". Ofqual's report said that the English GCSE grades in January were \"too generous\". Ofqual's report said that the English GCSE grades in January were \"too generous\". The only condition that appears to have been met is that teaching standards have remained largely consistent. The guidelines also state: \"Students should not be advantaged or disadvantaged simply because they were the first to sit a new set of examinations.\" The watchdog has interpreted its own conditions differently, and is insisting that the comparable outcomes approach that prevented grades from rising in June was correctly implemented. But Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT heads' union, said: \"Ofqual doesn't seem to have applied the concept of comparable outcomes properly. \"In this instance there is a regulatory failure. It is a big mess.\" And Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said this appeared to be \"another piece of evidence that procedures applied to this exam was not fit for purpose\". Meanwhile, Ofqual said: \"The comparable outcomes approach was used correctly for GCSE English this year and we stand by this decision. \"Comparable outcomes are not intended to produce identical results year on year. \"What's important is that outcomes can be compared when taking into consideration a range of factors which may affect the results. More details on the use of this approach can be found in our report.\" But Dr Christopher Ray, chairman of the Head Masters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), said the issue was evidence of a deeper problem with Ofqual. \"The verdict of Ofqual's initial report and the reasoning to support it fall well short of answering the questions raised in the minds of schools and pupils.\" Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: \"It is clear that pupils, parents and education professionals, across the spectrum of schools, feel that pupils have been done a disservice. \"Whilst the Education Secretary Michael Gove says he is 'saddened' by the injustice that has been served to thousands of pupils, he is showing how out-of-touch he is with pupil opinion by refusing to take action.

First, it would reduce the tariffs paid to around 1,800 people who got into the scheme before November 2015. This would require an Assembly vote to change the tariffs from the new financial year starting in April. Secondly, there would be a public consultation on a longer-term solution.

The political parties failed to find a resolution. The scheme was related to the political crisis at Stormont. The political crisis at Stormont was caused by the failure of the political parties to find a resolution. Martin McGuinness resigned on Monday as deputy first minister in protest against the botched handling of the scheme and, after Mrs Foster refused to step aside while an investigation was held. Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing agreement, Mrs Foster loses her first minister role with the departure of Mr McGuinness. The Sinn Féin MLA's decision to quit is likely to lead to a snap election. The party has seven days to nominate a new deputy first minister, but is adamant it will not replace him. If it chooses not to, then the baton would pass to Secretary of State James Brokenshire who would be legally obliged to call an election. In an effort to avert such a move, the British and Irish governments have pledged to do what they can to resolve the crisis.",

        "document": "Most incidents came during the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union battled for influence across the continent. CIA covert operations are by their very nature hard to prove definitively. But research into the agency's work, as well as revelations by former CIA employees, has thrown up several cases where the agency tried to influence events. The agency is the CIA. The agency tried to influence events. The agency's work has been researched. Former CIA employees have revealed information. Here are four examples:. Patrice Lumumba became the first prime minister of the newly-independent Congo in 1960, but he lasted just a few months in the job before he was overthrown and assassinated in January 1961. In 2002, former colonial power Belgium admitted responsibility for its part in the killing, however, the US has never explained its role despite long-held suspicions. US President Dwight D Eisenhower, concerned about communism, was worried about Congo following a similar path to Cuba. According to a source quoted in Death in the Congo, a book about the assassination, President Eisenhower gave \"an order for the assassination of Lumumba. There was no discussion; the [National Security Council] meeting simply moved on\". However, a CIA plan to lace Lumumba's toothpaste with poison was never carried out, Lawrence Devlin, who was a station chief in Congo at the time, told the BBC in 2000. A survey of declassified US government documents from the era notes that the CIA \"initially focussed on removing Lumumba, not only through assassination if necessary but also with an array of non-lethal undertakings\". While there is no doubt the CIA wanted him dead, the survey does not indicate direct US involvement in his eventual killing. The CIA wanted him dead. The survey does not indicate direct US involvement in his eventual killing. Ghana's first President Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown in a military coup in 1966 while he was out of the country. He later suspected that the US had a role in his downfall and in a 1978 book, former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell backed this theory up. In In Search of Enemies he writes that an official sanction for the coup does not appear in CIA documents, but he writes \"the Accra station was nevertheless encouraged by headquarters to maintain contact with dissidents. \"It was given a generous budget, and maintained intimate contact with the plotters as a coup was hatched.\" He says that the CIA in Ghana got more involved and its operatives were given \"unofficial credit for the eventual coup\". A declassified US government document does show awareness of a plot to overthrow the president, but does not indicate any official backing. Another declassified document written after the coup describes Nkrumah's fall as a \"fortuitous windfall. Nkrumah was doing more to undermine our interests than any other black African\". In Angola three competing groups fought for control after independence from Portugal in 1975, with the MPLA under Agostinho Neto taking over the capital Luanda. Mr Stockwell, chief of CIA's covert operations in Angola in 1975, writes that Washington decided to oppose the MPLA, as it was seen as closer to the Soviet Union, and support the FNLA and Unita instead, even though all three had help from communist countries. The CIA then helped secretly import weapons, including 30,000 rifles, through Kinshasa in neighbouring Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr Stockwell says in a video documentary. He adds that CIA officers also trained fighters for armed combat. A declassified US government document detailing a discussion between the head of the CIA, the secretary of state and others indicates the support the CIA gave to the forces fighting the MPLA. The US continued to support Unita through much of the civil war as Cuba was backing the MPLA. Hissene Habre failed in his attempt to take power by force in Chad in 1980. But his efforts led President Goukouni Oueddei to call on help from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose soldiers successfully beat back Habre's challenge and forced him into exile. A proposed alliance between Libya and Chad began to unsettle the US especially as Gaddafi began to be seen as a supporter of anti-US activities. In Foreign Policy magazine Michael Bronner writes that the CIA director, with the secretary of state, \"coalesced around the idea of launching a covert war in partnership with Habre\". It is alleged that the US then backed Habre's overthrow of the president in 1982 and then supported him throughout his brutal rule.",

        "document": "Across the world, drug laws are being relaxed, from Uruguay to Portugal, Jamaica and the Czech Republic. Does this mean the war on drugs has been lost? Does this mean the war on drugs has been lost? The BBC World Service's The Inquiry hears from four expert witnesses, including a former Colombian president and a drugs prosecutor turned defence lawyer. After many years prosecuting drugs offences as an Assistant US Attorney, growing frustration with the approach inspired Bonny Klapper to become a defence attorney. \"About 10 years into my career, it really hit me that the people I was prosecuting were not just drug traffickers. They were mothers, they were fathers, and I really began to take an interest in why these individuals got involved in drug trafficking.\" One Colombian drug runner had a big impact:. \"At 14 he had a choice: go work in the emerald mines, or do something else. So he started in the emerald mines, and it was a horrible experience. And then he was offered the chance to work as a driver for one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Cartel. He started as a driver, and ultimately rose up through the ranks. \"In countries like Colombia,  sometimes if you want to support your family - and you don't come from a wealthy family or you're not highly educated - drugs is the only path that you have to get yourself out of poverty.\" She noticed other problems back in the US at the other end of the chain:. \"[We] would prosecute money remitter houses in Queens that were sending drug money to Colombia. We prosecuted one, we shut it down, and the next day another one opened up in the same location. Or we prosecuted very high level traffickers, either in the US or in Colombia, and once they were extradited, someone else came in to take their place. \"We've shifted the problem from Colombia to Mexico. Now all of Central America is inundated because the traffickers got sophisticated, and they're moving through Guatemala and Honduras, and those countries are turning into narco states.\" She argues the approach to drugs users is equally flawed:. \"The prison system is a disaster. There's virtually no rehabilitation. Locking up low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options is not effective, because they go to jail, they come out, they get involved with drugs again, and they go right back to it. \"I have nothing but praise for the law enforcement agents I've worked with [but] so many of them have said to me 'we're fighting a war that can't be won the way we're fighting it'. \"The war itself is at a draw. And I believe that draw will be maintained indefinitely unless there's a dramatic change in our approach to drugs and drug trafficking.\" Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria worked on the Global Commission on Drug Policy report in 2011 which called on states to decriminalise drugs. \"Our recommendation is regulation for everything. That's what Portugal did. \"If you look at the last 50 years, what has been done? In the US, 600,000 people in jail, $40bn (Â£27bn) of spending a year. The highest rates of consumption of the whole world. You have to say that it doesn't work. It's a failed policy, and public opinion knows that. \"Ten years ago it was unthinkable that the US would move massively to the legalisation of cannabis. \"That taboo has been broken. In the US, a majority of people are talking about approving legalisation of marijuana.\" He cites the example of Uruguay, the first country to legalise the marijuana trade. \"All Latin America's looking at Uruguay. It's a country that also looks how to deal with the production, with the supply of the marijuana that is in the state hands. \"I don't expect any major set back of the policy that the Uruguayans have put in place. \"From the beginning in 1961, the objective of the UN Conventions has been to live in a world free of drugs, but it's a utopia. It's something unreachable. It's not to recognise human nature.\" Former chief scientist in the White House Office of National Drug Policy Control David Murray insists the billions of dollars spent tackling drug traffickers and destroying coca crops were well spent:. \"A 75% reduction in the productive capacity of Colombian cocaine was achieved by strategic initiatives of supply reduction in partnership with the leadership and political will of the Colombians themselves. \"That's been a sustained achievement that then resulted in a more than 45% drop in the prevalence rate of cocaine use in the United States on the streets. \"This is a global business. As a global business they have their preferred mode of operation where they would like to be with regard to supply routes - ungoverned safe havens where they would like to be to carry out their business with maximum efficiency. \"When you push them off of that spot they will adapt but they are diminished. \"We may have an idealised world where prevention and treatment and recovery happen in a certain way and we don't have to do the hard and dirty work, but that's not the reality on the ground. \"The reality is it's a tough slog, it is a cancer and it is worth fighting. Sure it's discouraging to see drug use continue but it actually is diminished if you take a long perspective over time and we actually are making progress with regard to it.\" Professor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland has been a leading academic in the field of drugs policy for decades. \"The war on drugs was partly defined by its rhetoric. The war on drugs was partly defined by its rhetoric. The war on drugs had a rhetorical aspect. \"The need for national leaders to stand up and talk about the scourge of drugs, and signal to the population that [being tough on drugs] was a priority was an important part of the war itself. \"There's going to be less and less of that. I think there's going to be a change both in tone and substance, so the 'war on drugs' will become a less and less plausible metaphor for describing policy. I think it's going to be a public health rhetoric for the foreseeable future. \"I do believe that we have in a sense had an experiment with trying to be very aggressive about controlling drugs through use of prohibition. And we have a sense that that did not work well. And so we're now trying to find better ways of managing the problem, and I think that's welcome. \"If you look at the number of people who are in prison for drug offences, at least in the US, that's an important indicator of the change in real policy, and those numbers are starting to go down. Not dramatically, but they are definitely going down, and many states are making changes that are likely to accelerate that decline.\" As drug laws soften he argues the question of regulation becomes key, as happened when gambling was legalised:. \"Lottery play was always seen as a bad thing, you legalised it because you wanted to take money away from organised crime, but the result was that the state lotteries became the most aggressive promoters. The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service, Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT. Listen to the programme. Download the programme. \"You have slogans like 'Why be a mug and work when you can play the lottery and win easily? ', just the kind of slogan you'd associate with the worst commercial promotion, but done by the state. \"Alcohol is still heavily promoted, and it's promoted in states that have state liquor monopolies, and we've only recently really been able to restrict smoking promotions. \"So I think there's considerable risk that even if there was a monopoly there would be promotion of marijuana, and clearly what we see in the state of Colorado where it is commercially available, it's regulated, like alcohol, what we see is very aggressive promotion, advertising. \"You cannot with a straight face say that marijuana legalisation won't lead to more marijuana dependence. \"Choose your problem. There is no solution. Use of psychoactive drugs is a social problem like a whole lot of other social problems. We manage it. And we may manage it better or worse, but the notion that we solve a problem is simplistic. We're simply managing a problem.\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT. Listen online or download the podcast.",

He's in the process of clinching a deal to replace Swanson in time for the European signing deadline but the Scobbie departure has been a bit of a shock and it comes at a time when fellow defender Brian Easton is being treated for a groin problem. \"There is a risk Brian may miss Europe and that certainly leaves us short in terms of a left-back,\" said the Northern Irishman. \"I wanted Thomas {Scobbie} re-signed. I know he was more than happy to stay, but something's happened that it's fallen through so I've got to deal with that. \"It's part of management, you don't always get what you want and now we've got to move on and do the best for the club. I'm now putting all my efforts in to get a left-back to be cover for losing Thomas.\" Wright drew praise for his handling of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team-mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half-time in the match with Hamilton. But the manager says that incident on 1 April was one of the toughest tests of his managerial career. \"I didn't see it and still haven't seen it because there's no footage of it, which is a miracle these days,\" he said. \"Immediately after the game, when I'm hearing what's allegedly happened, there was one thought in my head: that the two of them can go, they're out, they're sacked. \"But then it was time for calm heads and leadership from the club and myself. The lads very quickly helped the situation by admitting they were wrong, they were remorseful. \"So come the Saturday night they definitely weren't going to be sacked, but the chairman and I felt that for the image of the club we'd deal with this as severely and as quickly as we could (with a fine and reprimand). \"We were honest with the players, in terms of how we felt they had let not only themselves down, but the club and Scottish football as a whole. \"The timing of it could have derailed our season. We actually lost the game 1-0, losing a goal in the 91st minute after doing brilliantly with nine men and that was gut-wrenching for the players.\" Wright feels that by beating Hearts with a weakened squad and then Inverness in Saints' next two games, it showed the benefit of  \"having good people and a good squad\". On Monday, St Johnstone will find out who they will face in the first qualifying round of the Europa League.",

        "document": "In that time, the technology developed here has changed India immensely. Mr Modi is here to make sure it continues to do so for decades to come, but perhaps now with more benefit to those back home. His visit, which was welcomed by more than 20,000 expats on Sunday evening at a stadium reception in San Jose, comes at a time when Indian and Indian-American success in Silicon Valley is truly formidable. There's the charismatic Satya Nadella in charge at Microsoft. There's the 10-year-strong reign of Shantanu Narayen at the top of Adobe. And more recently, Sundar Pichai took over as chief executive of Google - a role many said had been years coming. Indians in California say it's the blend of temperament and competitive spirit that brings success their way. \"If an old school friend starts a company in Silicon Valley,\" one Valley-based Indian tech executive, Mohit Aron, told me, \"I'm going to start an even better one\". Mr Modi continues to ride the strong waves of support back home. A recent US think-tank study suggests 87% of Indians have \"favourable opinions\" of the leader. Outside the stadium, that enthusiasm was on full display - though not without the accompaniment of a strong protest against his government. Those not on \"Team Modi\" are angry at what they see as ignorance towards Mr Modi's past. In particular, they say he did little to prevent the killing of Muslims in the Gujarat riots in 2002. And when it comes to Digital India, Mr Modi's plans to get a billion more Indians on the internet, they say that's a front to mass surveillance. A letter, signed by more than 100 academics in Silicon Valley ahead of Mr Modi's visit, backed up this concern. They believe the positivity around his leadership, particularly in the Indian press, is more to do with aggression from the government towards its critics. Yet the support for Mr Modi in the US appeared genuine - and its his tech-savvy attitude to communicating that seems to impress people most. \"We're very proud,\" said one supporter outside the stadium. The SAP Center is in San Jose, a city that sits at the bottom of Silicon Valley, a region where Indians truly thrive. The SAP Center is in San Jose. San Jose is a city. San Jose is at the bottom of Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is a region. Indians thrive in Silicon Valley. Some 26% of tech companies here are founded or run by Indians and Indian Americans. That's more than the next five immigrant groups combined. Mr Modi has come here on a mission to bring some of that success, and wealth, back to India. To do it, he needs help. Before India can even begin to think of itself as a genuinely major technology player, it needs to cover the basics. Mr Modi, effortlessly adopting Silicon Valley's obsession with buzzwords, said the country needs both highways and \"i-ways\", by which he meant fibre internet, connecting each and every Indian town and village. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Modi spent time with someone who could help, taking part in a Q&A with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. It was decidedly more A than Q, mind, as of 40,000 questions submitted to Mr Modi, only three were asked during the session. They covered the rewards of getting online, particularly when it comes to creating jobs. Mr Modi spoke of his delight at his tweets and messages to other world leaders \"going viral\". The last question, from Mr Zuckerberg, asked about Mr Modi's relationship with his mother. Pausing, Mr Modi became emotional as he told of cleaning dishes for those less fortunate. The prime minister even appeared to cry. The prime minister appeared to cry. An elderly Indian lady later told me it made her feel like he was \"just like us\". Those who see Mr Modi less favourably say that was exactly its intention, a staged display designed to build his reputation as a man of the people. The meeting at Facebook was mutually beneficial. Mr Zuckerberg, keen as ever to expand Facebook's user base and global influence, talked up the prospect of connecting a billion more Indians to the internet. In one of the most pointed exchanges in the entire session, Mr Modi said he hoped Mr Zuckerberg's motivations weren't purely about Facebook's bank balance. For Mr Modi, this entire Silicon Valley visit is a chance to put a little pressure on the tech giants. Mr Modi is visiting Silicon Valley. Mr Modi wants to put pressure on the tech giants. He wants India to graduate from being home to the low-end of the tech trade - call centres and cheap labour - and instead an attractive place to start a technology business. Indeed, he wants India to be a great place to start any kind of business, and reverse the trend of great minds, particularly in tech, heading to California. One parent outside the SAP Center, whose children were dressed in stunning, sparkling saris, said she believed when her girls grow up they will see moving back to India as a career aspiration - in the same way she saw the US as way to a better life.

I don't know your name, and it's good that I don't, because I am sure you do not want to be associated with that video of the bullies savagely punching you to the ground. They are worse than that. I was really shocked by what I saw. You saw something shocking. Loads of people were disgusted. You are just 15. Ben, something similar happened to me. I was a sensitive young teen, always trying and failing to be coolâ€¦ never athletic enough, never hip enough, a late developer, crazy hair, with uncool parents who thought church was the main event. I worshipped indie bands - Joy Division especially - in the way that sensitive souls do. I wanted to be a jock, but I was a nerd. Maybe you recognise that. One day I was at a party and spoke to a girl. Apparently she was the girlfriend of someone important. He sent his friend to beat me up. The friend said: \"Excuse me, can I tell you something?\" And because he was shorter than me I had to lean down to hear him. Having moved my head within range, he punched me as hard as you got punched. I had never been hit before. The shock was unbelievable - violence does that. The shock was unbelievable. Violence causes shock. I went down immediately just like you. My mates, also sensitive souls, were too scared to help. They were gutted afterwards. You feel humiliated. Your pride is hurt, your head is hurt - I had a gigantic black eye. A person can get very down over a beating. Some people think depression evolved in us as a way of keeping us safe if we lose a fight - the mind and body working together to prevent you re-entering the conflict for your own safety. It took me ages before I wasn't scared of being hit again. You look over your shoulder for a while, and you feel a primal fear. That is natural, Ben. That is natural. Ben is a name. So I watched your video and saw myself. That guy who distracted me in 1980 could be the thug who hit you from behind in 2016 - such a coward. Can I give you some advice? Yes, you can give me some advice. Don't think you have to be hard like them. I tried to be a tough teenager afterwards and closed myself off like a drum. I reacted to nothing and felt nothing. Then I got to university and found people like me who would never dream of punching someone, and my life opened up like a flower. A kind lecturer was shocked when I proudly and foolishly told him I had never read a poem. He said, \"We'll change that,\" and helped me understand the power of poetry. One day in my student room I read a poem and cried. I was alive again. Sure, I would never win a fight - I have never hit anyone in my life - but you don't need to hit people to succeed in your life. Quite the opposite. The courts will decide who assaulted you and how to punish them. In our society, what happened to you is thankfully now taken very seriously. But let me tell you something about the lads in the video. In 20 years, when you're with the person you love and hopefully in a career you have a passion for, they will still be scumbags. Their cupboards will smell of gym sweat and cheeseburgers. Each will own one suit which he wore to the funeral of a friend who died doing a wheelie on a motorway - by the way, they all wore the same baffled expression at the funeral service. They've gone from making the weather to being rained on, and they complain about it constantly. They are not something anyone wants to be with - their lives are already over. Five per cent of people are good at fighting. I'm not one and nor are you. It is very important we let the 5% fight each other. Live by the sword, die by the sword: the thug who beat me up was in hospital himself a year later after someone broke a bottle across his face. Meanwhile, you and I can read poetry and listen to our favourite bands, and if we sometimes cry, there is no shame in that. To cry is to live. The people who attacked you are the walking dead. The people who attacked are the walking dead. Come into Radio 2 sometime and I'd be happy to show you around. Yours, Jeremy\"",

        "document": "Under US law, 40% of the corn harvest must be used to make biofuel, a quota which the UN says could contribute to a food crisis around the world. A drought and heatwave across the US has destroyed much of the country's corn crop, driving up prices. The US argues that producing much of its own fuel, rather than importing it, is good for the country. The latest forecasts from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggest that this year's corn yield - the amount produced per acre - will be the lowest since 1995-6. Total production will be the lowest for six years, it forecast, due to the extreme heat and dryness. As a result, the USDA is predicting further rises in prices. It now thinks farm prices for corn will average $7.50-$8.90 per bushel, a sharp rise on the $5.40-$6.40 per bushel it predicted just a month ago. By Mark MardellNorth America editor. Writing in the Financial Times, the director general of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Jose Graziano da Silva, said suspension of the quota would allow more of the crop to be diverted for food production. \"The worst drought for 50 years is inflicting huge damage on the US maize crop, with serious consequences for the overall international food supply. \"The situation reminds us that even the most advanced agricultural systems are subject to the vagaries of the weather, leading to volatility in supplies and prices, not just on domestic markets, but also internationally.\" Concerns about the impact of the dry weather in the US pushed maize prices up by 23% in July, according to the latest FAO food price index. But the US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the biofuels standard was having a positive impact on the country. \"It is impacting in a positive way the cost of gasoline in this country - some estimates put it at 25 cents to as much as $1.30 less for gas because we have a biofuel industry. \"There are jobs connected to that industry and less reliance on foreign oil. The question is: Is the market responding to concerns about supply and the answer is yes. \"Exports are down just a bit and ethanol production is down from between 10% and 30%, depending on the part of the country.\" By law, 13 billion gallons of biofuel must be produced in the US this year. The country's Renewable Fuel Standard, as the law is known, was designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on imported oil. It has long been controversial, with many blaming the quota for pushing up corn prices. It has long been controversial. Many blame the quota for pushing up corn prices.

But Nadia Nadim nodded Denmark level after half-time and Theresa Nielsen's late header completed the comeback. It is only Germany's third loss in the 26-year history of the competition. The Olympic champions - ranked second in the world - created plenty of chances but were also frequently opened up at the back by a Denmark side who, after a nervy start, became increasingly dangerous. The opener came courtesy of a goalkeeping error, as Stina Lykke Petersen misjudged Kerschowski's fierce shot from the edge of the area and could only parry the German's shot in to the net. After the break, Germany hesitated when they thought they had conceded a free-kick only for the referee to play an advantage that Denmark took, with Portland Thorns forward Nadim jumping well at the far post to nod in the equaliser. Plenty of openings for both sides followed as the game became stretched with the prospect of extra time looming. Another right-wing cross found Nielsen unmarked in the Germany penalty area on 83 minutes and she headed in to spark wild Danish celebrations.

A fifth successive title win is all but wrapped up. The PFA Scotland Player of the Year is mentioned. The PFA Scotland Player of the Year has thoughts about defending the crown next season. \"We're fired up again for next year,\" Griffiths said. \"We've got five in-a-row and next year we'll look at making it six.\" Griffiths scooped the Player of the Year prize after a season in which he has contributed 39 goals, and is humbled to be marked out by his peers as the top player in the country in this campaign. \"As a professional footballer to be voted as the player of the year is the main one, you are playing against teams week in week out and for them to vote you the best player in the country is special,\" said the Celtic striker. \"I still have {my young player award} in the house. My mum's wanting this one, but she's not getting it.\" Griffiths' individual displays have kept Celtic's title defence on-track this season, but failure in the cup competitions and in Europe has left many fans disillusioned with the club, and questioning the direction it is heading. Failure to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League was an early-season blow, and a winless run in the Europa League did little to appease the Celtic support. Then came a League Cup semi-final defeat to Ross County and, most painfully of all, a Scottish Cup loss at the same stage to bitter rivals Rangers. These factors combined left manager Ronny Deila feeling he had no option other than to step down at the end of the current campaign. \"We were disappointing,\" admits Griffiths. Griffiths admits disappointment. Griffiths is disappointing. \"The European campaign wasn't great and the cup defeat against Rangers - everybody said it was a disaster but you know we played one of our worst games of the season and we drew, but got beaten on penalties which we all know is just a lottery.\" \"{Players} could've been performing better, you know we've lost silly points in silly games. We were beaten twice by Aberdeen, we've drawn a couple of home games we didn't score in but we still managed to wrap up a league title and that's the most important thing.\" The list of potential candidates to succeed Deila is a long one. David Moyes, Paul Lambert, Malky Mackay, Michael O'Neill, Brendan Rodgers, Neil Lennon, Roy Keane - just some of the names that have been linked with the soon-to-be-vacant Parkhead hotseat since Deila announced he would be exiting Parkhead in the summer. Griffiths has already paid tribute to the Norwegian for coaxing out of him the best form of his career, but says a new man in the dugout represents an opportunity for every player at Celtic. \"Everybody in the changing room is going to have a clean slate,\" said the Scotland international. \"There are players in the dressing room who will be in favour and others who won't be in favour and it will be up to them to work their way back into the squad. \"I've had a good season so far but a new manager coming in will have his own ideas - hopefully I'm part of that plan.\" The football world has been captivated by the fairytale story of Leicester City defying the odds to become Premier League champions. Aberdeen did provide a challenge for the Premiership title, but the feeling among many was that Celtic, for all their shortcomings, would have too much strength in depth over the course of the season. So it has proved, and Griffiths is pleased that another Leicester-style underdog triumph has not unfolded in Scotland. \"As players we are delighted with what Leicester have achieved as it shows why football is the best sport in the world. But we don't want any underdogs winning leagues up here, we want it to be us. \"Aberdeen may have run us close this year, but ultimately we want to be Scottish champions at the end of the year.\" Celtic can clinch the title with a point when the Dons visit Parkhead at the weekend. Celtic can clinch the title. Celtic can clinch the title with a point. The point can be clinched when the Dons visit Parkhead. The Dons will visit Parkhead at the weekend. \"The boys are buzzing, we can't wait to go out and confirm ourselves as champions on Sunday. \"We know there's going to be a big crowd coming and we want to send the fans home happy. Hopefully it's three points, we only need one, but we know Aberdeen will come down and make it difficult for us.\" Having established himself beyond doubt as Celtic's leading forward, Griffiths' next target is to gain the same status in the Scotland team. The former Hibs striker has seven caps to his name, but has yet to establish himself in Gordon Strachan's side, more often than not finding himself behind Steven Fletcher in the pecking order. Griffiths hopes the end-of-season friendly internationals against Italy on 29 May and France on 4 June will give him a chance to prove his worth before the 2018 World Cup qualifiers kick off with a trip to Malta in September. \"I'm just happy to be back in the squad now and if I get a start I'll be buzzing, if not sit on that bench and wait my turn. \"We've got a lot of good strikers all vying for that one place. You've got to be playing well and in favour so hopefully come the World Cup qualifiers I'll be that man.\"",

The visit by inspectors lasted for three weeks. The visit by inspectors was part of an investigation. They examined 162 case and complaint files and interviewed CPS staff, police and crime commissioners and partner organisations such as Citizens Advice. The Inspectorate said the CPS should be more consistent in the quality of their letters and how quickly they send them to victims, and added the CPS and police should agree on their roles in communicating case outcomes to victims to avoid sending confusing or duplicated information. They also stated the CPS should \"implement an effective process\" for notifying victim liaison units when charges are altered in a case, so that staff can inform victims. Inspectors did say the CPS was facing increased pressure due to staff cuts, and the report also highlighted that the organisation had taken steps to improve service, including drafting new guidance about speaking to witnesses at court to improve the quality of service.

        "document": "With delicious timing, Patrick Buisson - the man credited with inspiring his former boss's rightward shift on issues like national identity - has released a book of recollections concerning the seven years he served as his top aide. To no-one's surprise, given the way the pair parted company after Mr Sarkozy lost the presidency in 2012, it drips with the satisfaction of a finally requited revenge. I have known some acts of treachery in my time... but rarely like this\" In one passage, Mr Buisson claims that Nicolas Sarkozy deliberately allowed rioters from the suburbs to rampage in central Paris, the better to show off his capacity to restore order. It was in 2006, when Mr Sarkozy was at the interior ministry and his rival, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, was pushing through a labour reform hotly contested by French youth. Mr Buisson quotes Mr Sarkozy as recalling: \"We took the decision to allow gangs of blacks and Arabs to attack the young whites on the Invalides, and at the same time tipped off the photographers at Paris Match that there was likely to be serious trouble. \"We were petrified that someone might end up getting seriously hurt, but in the end it was worth it.\" At the demonstration that followed, police intervened early and Mr Sarkozy was on hand for the television cameras, \"proving how much he was in control of the situation compared with the prime minister\", writes Mr Buisson. The former adviser is scathing about Mr Sarkozy's \"narcissistic\" personality, and says his public courtship and marriage to \"trophy woman\" Carla Bruni was an excruciating embarrassment. \"Probably he thought deep down that the happy news of his love life would be a useful antidote to the prevailing gloom. Instead [the reaction] could be summed up in three words: immature, undignified, infantile.\" He is also unsparing of Carla Bruni herself, who he says \"did deep harm to [the Sarkozy] presidency\". \"The head of state... was in reality a fragile seducer subjugated by his conquests, a fake tough guy submerged in a permanent state of emotional dependency.\" The head of state is a character. The head of state is a fragile seducer. The head of state is subjugated by his conquests. The head of state is a fake tough guy. The head of state is submerged in a permanent state of emotional dependency. In politics, Mr Buisson says Nicolas Sarkozy was always words rather than action, that he lacked guiding principles and was more interested in the short-term buzz of media approval. \"The public man... was always constrained by the private man, by his passions, his confusions, his weakness for whatever was in vogue.\" The book reveals that the aspiring president was in contact with far-right National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen between the two rounds of the 2007 election, which he won, in the hope of winning FN votes for round two. And in 2005 Mr Buisson quotes him as saying: \"The values of the far right are the values of all the French. It's just the way the FN puts them that is shocking. The French do not like over-spicy food.\" Now fully engaged in November's primary to choose the centre-right's presidential candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy has dismissed Mr Buisson's book as unworthy of notice. Nicolas Sarkozy is fully engaged in November's primary. Nicolas Sarkozy's goal is to choose the centre-right's presidential candidate. Nicolas Sarkozy has dismissed Mr Buisson's book.

Two years later it was revealed that throughout the Sarkozy presidency Mr Buisson had been secretly recording conversations and meetings at the Elysee. Speaking on television at the time, Mr Sarkozy said: \"I have known some acts of treachery in my time, but rarely like this!\" Mr Sarkozy spoke on television.

In that case, it paid $17,000 to get access to files back. Kentucky Methodist Hospital information systems director Jamie Reid named the malware involved as Locky, a new bug that encrypts files, documents and images and renames them with the extension .locky. The most common way Locky gets itself on machines is via a spam email with an attached document that looks like nonsense and advises readers to enable macros \"if the data encoding is incorrect\". Once the malware is downloaded, it sends a message to desktops with instructions about how users can pay to have files unlocked. In November, a report from Intel's McAfee labs said the number of ransomware attacks was expected to grow in 2016. A report from Intel's McAfee labs was released in November. The report said the number of ransomware attacks was expected to grow in 2016. Security expert Brian Krebs said: \"It's a fair bet that as ransomware attacks and attackers mature, these schemes will slowly become more targeted. \"I also worry that these more deliberate attackers will take a bit more time to discern how much the data they've encrypted is really worth, and precisely how much the victim might be willing to pay to get it back.\"",

        "document": "As Abid Naseer started his cross-examination in a New York courtroom of the police officer who searched his Manchester bedroom in 2009, he commented it was nice to hear a Mancunian accent again. Abid Naseer started his cross-examination. The cross-examination took place in a New York courtroom. The police officer who searched Abid Naseer's bedroom was the one being questioned. The search of Abid Naseer's bedroom took place in Manchester in 2009. Abid Naseer commented on hearing a Mancunian accent again. Six years ago, the Pakistani national had been living in the north-west English city where he plotted to kill hundreds in a bombing attack at the city centre's Arndale shopping complex during Easter weekend. Naseer, who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013, was convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al-Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device. Defending himself at his trial in New York, the 28-year-old was polite, calm and professional. He denied he was involved in any form of extremism. But, according to the police officer who headed up the British investigation into his activities, his courtroom conduct was a performance designed to con the jury. In a cafe overlooking the Brooklyn courthouse where the trial was held, Det Supt Mark Smith said Naseer was a good actor, an al-Qaeda trained terrorist and a man with a determination to kill hundreds of people. He said: \"He has had lots of time to develop his Westernised social skills, but I would say don't be fooled. Beneath that cool, relaxed exterior is a cold, calculated terrorist.\" Held in custody in the US ahead of his trial, Naseer had spent the months preparing his legal case and working out. One police officer commented that he had doubled in size since he was handcuffed and led away from a Cheetham Hill house in April 2009. Were it not for his arrest, detectives are convinced he would have gone ahead with a \"mass-casualty\" attack in Manchester city centre. There was an arrest. The arrest involved a suspect for a \"mass-casualty\" attack. The suspect was planning to attack Manchester city centre. The arrest prevented the attack from happening. Based upon intelligence gathered and the plots devised by other terrorists trained at the same al-Qaeda camp in Pakistan, police have pieced together what they believe would have happened. Emails sent from an internet café near Naseer's home had been intercepted in the weeks before his arrest. Emails were sent from an internet café. The internet café was near Naseer's home. The emails were intercepted. The emails were sent in the weeks before Naseer's arrest. The final message led police to believe an attack was imminent. Known as the \"Hi Buddy\" email because of the way it greeted an al-Qaeda operative, it reads: \"I met with Nadia family and we both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between these dates.\" The jury was told female names, including Nadia, represented different ingredients used to make bombs. Wedding, or 'nikah', was a standard al-Qaeda code for a terror attack. Wedding, or 'nikah', was a standard al-Qaeda code. Wedding, or 'nikah', was a code for a terror attack. Based on the Islamic calendar, investigators believed this email was referring to a planned attack during the Easter weekend in 2009. Other evidence included photos of Naseer's friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre. He claimed they were innocent pictures as they travelled around Manchester. But retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue described the images as \"hostile reconnaissance\". He said: \"That for me was the most alarming thing. To see each entrance of the Arndale Centre being photographed… that was clearly a means by which they would brief the would-be attackers as to what they would see as they made their approaches.\" Police think the first target would have been the Arndale Centre, which had been rebuilt following the IRA bomb attack on Manchester in 1996. The terrorists would have walked in carrying bombs made out of fizzy drink bottles in rucksacks or specially modified T-shirts. After the first wave of explosions, there would have been a second attack with more suicide bombers waiting in St Anne's Square for the rush of shoppers trying to escape. The target was chosen by al-Qaeda leaders because of the financial impact as well as the huge number of potential victims. According to Dr David Lowe, a retired special branch officer who now teaches law at John Moores University in Liverpool, it would have been a devastating attack. He said: \"It would have potentially been bigger than the 7/7 attack in London. It would have sent shockwaves around the world. And it would have shown that not just capital cities are targets.\" The scale of the potential disaster is something the man who led the police investigation is well aware of. The man who led the police investigation is aware of the scale of the potential disaster. Det Supt Smith said the relief he felt at the time of the arrests continued today. \"Every day since that time I've thought about this case and wondered exactly what would have happened if we didn't detain him. \"I've always been convinced that we prevented an atrocity in Manchester.\"",

Helen Steel, who had a relationship with an undercover officer, said police committed \"human rights abuses\". But police said undercover officers can play an important role. Lawyers investigating allegations for the Home Office say they have uncovered more than 80 possible miscarriages of justice relating to undercover policing. Investigations revealed officers had also had relationships with women while undercover, and had used the names of dead children. Undercover: The allegations made to date. Opening proceedings at the Royal Courts of Justice, Lord Justice Pitchford said: \"It seems likely that the inquiry will expose both creditable and discreditable conduct, practice and management. Lord Justice Pitchford spoke at the Royal Courts of Justice. Lord Justice Pitchford said that the inquiry will expose both creditable and discreditable conduct, practice and management. \"At the conclusion of its investigation, the inquiry will report to the home secretary and make recommendations as to the deployment of undercover police officers in future.\" \"Jacqui\", who had a son with a man she thought was a fellow animal rights activist, did not discover he was an undercover police officer until 25 years after he disappeared from her life. She told the BBC the discovery was \"like an earthquake\". \"I want this inquiry to really get to the truth... and come to some conclusion about whether this money and human misery was worth it\". She wants the officers themselves to have the chance to give evidence, perhaps anonymously, \"and not have to worry about the Official Secrets Act or what's going to happen to them\". She hopes \"what happened to me... what happened to other women, will never happen again. \"There is no circumstance where having sexual relations in order to get information on a group, whatever the group is, is ever justified.\" The home secretary ordered the review after claims police spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence. Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, said more than one judge should oversee the case, or its conclusions should be left to a jury. \"You have an old saying - two heads are better than one,\" he said. \"Sometimes one person might miss something and the other one can bring them back to where they're supposed to be\". And Ms Steel said: \"These undercover policing units have committed grievous human rights abuses which are absolutely shocking in a supposedly democratic society. We want to make sure they don't happen again to anybody else, and for that to happen we need the full truth to emerge.\" Case study. \"Alison\" was a member of an independent political group in London in the 1990s when she formed a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy. They were together for five years and lived together for four. But Mark disappeared suddenly, saying he'd had a row with his mother and was depressed. \"His disappearance five years after we met was very sudden and unexpected and didn't make sense. I spent a long time trying to find out where he was and why he'd left,\" Alison told Radio 4's Today programme. She believes claims of depression were part of an \"exit strategy\" used by officers. \"I knew I had to get on with my life and I did that, but still carried on looking and searching when I could,\" she added. She later found out \"Mark\" had a wife and children. \"I've carried on with my life, I've met somebody else who I grew up with as a child which was the only reason I was able to trust them was because I knew that they were who they said they were. \"And I've been fortunate enough to have a family, but many of the women who this has happened to have not been so fortunate.\" Lord Justice Pitchford's inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice will look into police infiltration of political and social justice groups in England and Wales since 1968.

The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary. That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into their activities. The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control. Seven key issues the inquiry will examine. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said undercover policing was an important tactic, but had to be done legally.

Conversely, Sale showed quickly they wanted to make a statement and did so through rugby league covert Solomona.

Medical examiners gave details of the injuries suffered by those who died in the attack. Mr Tsarnaev could face the death penalty if found guilty. Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Henry Nields testified that the youngest victim of the attacks, eight-year-old Martin Richard, received injuries to every part of his body. The testimony was illustrated by autopsy photos and the child's bloody, torn clothing. Mr Nields said one piece of shrapnel appeared to have gone straight through Richard's body. \"It would be difficult to say the precise location due to the size of the openings in the abdomen,\" he testified, according to Reuters. The defence began calling its own witnesses later on Monday. Earlier in the trial, the defence made the surprise admission that Mr Tsarnaev had participated in the attacks. The trial is about Mr Tsarnaev. The defence admitted that Mr Tsarnaev participated in the attacks. The admission was a surprise.

Mr Tsarnaev is also accused of fatally shooting a police officer three days later.

Mr Kasyanov is a high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Kasyanov is in the opposition RPR-Parnas party.

Strasbourg is a location. \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it!\" Last March Mr Kadyrov spoke out on Instagram about the assassination of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. That message defended one of the Chechens charged over the shooting. A day later President Putin gave Mr Kadyrov a top award. Mr Nemtsov was among several well-known opponents of Mr Putin murdered in the past decade. Putin loyalist Kadyrov unleashed on Russian 'traitors' Ramzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally. Mr Kadyrov runs Chechnya with an iron fist - his private militia has been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and assassination. He has close ties to Mr Putin, who encouraged him to stamp out a separatist insurgency in Chechnya. Thousands of civilians died in the North Caucasus republic when Russian troops fought the rebels there in the 1990s. The new video is the latest in a series of threatening messages from Mr Kadyrov against Kremlin critics, whom he accuses of working for the West. It shows Mr Kasyanov talking to Vladimir Kara-Murza, a journalist who runs the pro-democracy opposition movement Open Russia. The movement was launched by exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The video was posted late on Sunday and has more than 16,000 \"likes\". Mr Kasyanov says he sees it as a direct death threat and will demand a criminal investigation. Ilya Yashin, who co-chairs RPR-Parnas with Mr Kasyanov, called the video \"an open threat to murder Kasyanov\". Another opposition leader, anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, echoed that view. On Facebook, Mr Navalny said (in Russian) \"there is no longer any doubt that all such statements in recent weeks and specifically this one were approved by Putin and the Kremlin, and quite probably were inspired by them too\". The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says they key question now is whether Mr Kadyrov is acting on his own initiative. One theory discussed on Russian social media is that he is being used by the Kremlin to intimidate its critics - particularly as growing economic problems raise the potential for protest. Others suggest that Mr Kadyrov is becoming a dangerous loose cannon - a regional leader who believes he is untouchable, our correspondent reports.

Since the news broke 'North Korea' has been mentioned 211,000 times on Twitter and has been among the top trending topics worldwide. So what can be done to prevent North Korea's move escalate to an international crisis? Here are some of your ideas. @martinedobor tweets there should be greater agreement on weapons:. It's saddening and worrying that North Korea says that it carried out an H-bomb test. North Korea claims to have carried out an H-bomb test. The H-bomb test is saddening. The H-bomb test is worrying. That claim must be taken seriously by any person who cares about peace. This is a wake up call for the UN to swing into action in full force and stop North Korea's obsession with nuclear bombs. The UN should not wait until small ripples turn into huge waves before thinking of how to get to the shore. Josephat Ombuna, Nairobi, Kenya. @Jackalchachal thinks North Korea should be invited to talks:. North Korea needs to be accountable for its actions like any country. It's time for the world to have some serious dialogue with them. If you want to have nuclear weapons then you need to be trusted and must abide the rules. This would be the first big step to resolve this issue. Let's invite Kim Jong-un to the United Nations in New York and get down to business. Chris, Northfield, Vermont USA. @SouljaTroy1996 has a simple solution:. In my opinion sanctions are the way to go, if at all possible. Unfortunately this may cause more hardship on the people of the North. This may cause more hardship. This may cause more hardship on the people. This may cause more hardship on the people of the North. War is out of the question - we are fighting enough wars in the Middle East. I have thought deeply about this question for a while now (still am) , with China being an ally this would also be a concern for NATO. Kim Jong-un is a loose cannon and unpredictable and that makes him a threat. Robert Anderson, Dundee, Scotland UK. I think we need to be prepared for any possible threat of them using weapons such as these. However, I don't think we should charge in and force North Korea to stop producing nuclear weapons. That is of course assuming they have been successful in making them. If we or any other countries for that matter become aggressive to them, the retaliation could be much worse. It's best to prepare for the worst but mainly ignore them. It's not like many of the countries condemning North Korea's actions have any moral high ground when they themselves are sat upon a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons.

He says that, although as a youngster he did play on crutches with his pals, when he went to secondary school he lost confidence and began wearing his prosthetic leg all the time. His introduction to amputee football was in England, regularly travelling to Everton to get a game. It is rough at times - he broke his collarbone last year, but did not let that put him off. He describes the sport now being in Scotland as \"brilliant\". \"That's what I want to give to youngsters,\" he says. \"Don't let anyone stop you, just go for it.\" He adds that if he is still playing at the age of 47, then \"it doesn't matter what age you are\". Amputee football is played all over the world. In Turkey, for instance, there is a professional league, aired on television with 600 players.

Ms Sturgeon said: \"There is not going to be an independence referendum in 2017, I don't think there is anybody who thinks that is the case.\" Ms Sturgeon said there is not going to be an independence referendum.

She has previously said a vote on independence will be held if the Scottish government concludes it is the only way to protect Scotland's place in Europe. Ms Sturgeon has urged the UK government to negotiate a so-called soft Brexit and retain its membership of the single market. Failing that, she wants a special arrangement to allow Scotland to stay in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves. The first minister's latest comments regarding the timing of a second referendum follow her insistence at the weekend that she is not bluffing on calling a re-run of the 2014 ballot if Scotland's position is ignored. But she has also indicated that a soft Brexit could take the issue off the table in the short-term. Ms Sturgeon told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: \"We have to ask ourselves in Scotland are we happy to have the direction of our country, the kind of country we want to be, determined by a right-wing Conservative government perhaps for the next 20 years, or do we want to take control of our own future?\" \"That's the case that in those circumstances, I think, it would be right for Scotland to have the opportunity to decide.\" Asked if she was looking at a referendum \"much quicker\" than in five or 10 years' time if there was a hard Brexit, she said: \"I would think, yes. But let me not get away from this point, I'm putting to Theresa May a compromise solution.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said ruling out an independence referendum this year was an \"empty gesture\" by Ms Sturgeon. Accusing the first minister of \"leaving Scotland in limbo\", Ms Davidson added: \"If she's serious about allowing Scotland to move on from constitutional navel-gazing, she should ditch her draft referendum bill immediately.\" Scottish Labour deputy leader Alex Rowley said: \"While it is welcome that Nicola Sturgeon has ruled out another independence referendum in 2017, this doesn't come close to ending the uncertainty. \"The first minister should rule out forcing another independence referendum on the people of Scotland altogether, not just for the next twelve months.\" The first minister should rule out forcing another independence referendum.

PM Viktor Orban said Hungary would not allow migrants to leave its territory without registering. His comments came as Hungarian authorities opened the main rail station in Budapest to hundreds of migrants after a two-day stand-off. One train left, but then stopped near a migrant reception centre. Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan resisted efforts by police to get them off the train at Bicske, about 40km (25 miles) west of Budapest. Some were banging on the windows and shouting \"Germany, Germany.\" Follow our live updates. EU rules place responsibility for assessing asylum claims on the country where a migrant first arrives. Many of the migrants currently in Hungary have been refusing to register there, in order to continue their journeys to Germany before seeking asylum. Nothing illustrates how difficult this crisis is to resolve than what has happened to these several hundred refugees who are currently on this train at Bicske. They jumped on the train after waiting at Budapest station for three hours. They waited at Budapest station. They waited for three hours. They jumped on the train. They were really tightly crammed in - women and babies. They were told no international trains would leave. but eventually they were told this train would leave and they believed and hoped it would take them close enough to the Austrian border to get across. There were some police on board. There were some police on board. We got as far as Bickse and when the train pulled in, there were loads of police waiting for them on the platform. The plan seemed to be to remove them, to take them to a centre where they would be properly identified. Some people left the first carriage, but almost immediately there was resistance, a lot of people were banging on the windows, some were shouting \"Germany! The police put on riot gear. And then there was one really distressing scene involving a woman who was carrying a baby by the railway tracks shouting \"help! There was a struggle involving one of her companions and riot police. There was a struggle. The struggle involved one of her companions. The struggle involved riot police. This incensed some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train, they began pushing and jostling and there was a little bit of fighting with the riot police. And then they forced their way back on the train, which is where we are at the moment with police on the platform with several hundred refugees on the train in sweltering conditions. International services from Budapest's Keleti station were suspended indefinitely. There have been days of tension at the station. The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels this year. Germany expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this year - four times last year's total. The surge in numbers has created tension and disagreement over EU migration policy. Germany has been prepared to accept large numbers of asylum seekers, but other countries have not. Mr Orban, who heads the anti-immigration Fidesz party and was in Brussels for talks, said Hungarians and other Europeans were \"full of fear\" because \"they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation\". During a tense press conference with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, the Hungarian leader said that \"nobody would like to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia nor Poland nor Estonia. \"All of them would like to go to Germany,\" he said. \"Our job is only to register them.\" Mr Schulz countered: \"What we are seeing for the time being is egoism instead of common European sense. \"To say 'yeah, you know we have refugees all over in Europe but they all want to go to Germany and therefore we are not concerned' is effective, but wrong. And therefore I think we need a fair and just distribution.\" European Council president Donald Tusk said on Thursday that EU countries should accept at least 100,000 asylum seekers between them, a sharp increase on a previous European Commission target of 40,000. EU states instead so far committed to sharing some 32,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece. Mr Tusk also took Mr Orban to task for comments in which the Hungarian leader said his country was being \"overrun\" with refugees who threatened to undermine Europe's Christian roots. He said: \"Referring to Christianity in a public debate on migration must mean in the first place the readiness to show solidarity and sacrifice.\" The human cost of the crisis was also put into sharp focus on Wednesday when five children were among 12 migrants who drowned in Turkish waters while trying to reach Greece.

A refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who \"owing to a well-founded fear\" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and \"unable\" or \"unwilling\" to seek the protection of that country.

Mr Pistorius says he mistakenly shot his girlfriend. His girlfriend's name was Reeva Steenkamp. He shot her through the door. He believed she was a burglar. He broke the door down with a bat. The prosecution says he tried to beat down the door and then fired the gun. Mr Pistorius denies intentionally killing Ms Steenkamp in February 2013. Forensic expert Police Colonel Johan Vermeulen also said he thought Mr Pistorius had hit the door with the bat from a low angle, indicating he was not wearing his prosthetic legs at the time. By Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Pretoria. A big day in the Oscar Pistorius murder case. Oscar Pistorius is involved in a murder case. The Oscar Pistorius murder case is significant. The defence worked tirelessly to disprove a finding by Colonel Johan Vermeulen, a decorated forensic expert in the South African Police Service (SAPS). Oscar Pistorius's toilet door stood obtrusively in the courtroom, held up by a white frame, behind it a toilet cubicle. Col Vermeulen, a state witness, told the court that based on the marks on the door and their level Mr Pistorius was on his stumps when he struck the door with a cricket bat. The defence strongly challenged his version, adding that they will present their own expert witness who will prove Mr Pistorius was in fact wearing his prosthetics. Defence lawyer Barry Roux also introduced another dimension to the case, suggesting that the police recklessly handled the crime scene - he pointed to police shoe prints on the door. The forensics from the scene are a make or break for either side. Mr Roux's plan seems to include discrediting the integrity of the evidence collection process. He has already hinted at the possible contamination of the crime scene, placing the SAPS under a rather embarrassing spotlight. This contradicts the athlete's claim that he had been wearing his artificial limbs. Correspondents say whether or not the athlete was on his prosthetic limbs is important because it could match parts of his story that he accidentally shot Ms Steenkamp, or expose inconsistencies in it. The damaged toilet door, with four bullet holes, was examined in the courtroom along with a replica of the toilet cubicle. Forensic evidence on the location from which shots were fired, how they were grouped and their trajectory were presented to the court on Wednesday. Cross-examining, Mr Pistorius' defence team asked forensic expert Col Vermeulen to kneel and lift his feet, which caused him to wobble. The defence team claimed that Mr Pistorius therefore would not have been able to balance on his stumps and break down the door using a cricket bat. Defence lawyer Barry Roux also alleged that police had contaminated the crime scene by stepping on the door. Col Vermeulen argued that if Mr Pistorius was balanced enough to fire a gun, he could also break down a door with a bat. The forensics expert argued that the angle and location of the marks on the door suggested that they had been caused by someone much shorter than him. The defence team argued that a mark on the bottom of the door showed where Mr Pistorius had tried to kick open the door using his prosthetic legs. Col Vermeulen agreed that this was possible. \"The marks on the door are actually consistent with him not having his legs on and I suspect they must be similar to the height that he was when he fired the shots,\" he told the court. The prosecution argues that Mr Pistorius hit the door with the cricket bat before the shots were fired, but the defence claims it was the other way round. The prosecution argues a point. The point argued by the prosecution is that Mr Pistorius hit the door with the cricket bat before the shots were fired. The defence claims a different point. The point claimed by the defence is that it was the other way around, meaning that Mr Pistorius hit the door with the cricket bat after the shots were fired. The trial is now halfway through its second week. Earlier on Wednesday, a friend of Mr Pistorius claimed that the star had driven at 200 km/h (124mph) and that he had taken a picture of the speedometer to prove it. The defence team alleged that Darren Fresco was himself driving at the time and had therefore fabricated evidence. On Tuesday, Mr Pistorius' defence team questioned a pathologist's finding that his girlfriend had eaten less than two hours before he killed her. This contradicts the athlete's account that the pair had been in bed for several hours before the shooting. The state is seeking to convince the court that Mr Pistorius and Ms Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, and reality TV star, had an argument before the athlete fired the shots that killed her. There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors. If found guilty, the 27-year-old, a national sporting hero dubbed the \"blade runner\", could face life imprisonment.",

The BBC World Service's The Inquiry hears from four expert witnesses. Max Boykoff founded the Media Climate Change Observatory a decade ago. \"We monitor 50 sources around the world across 25 countries on six continents. We seek to put our fingers on the pulse of the ebbs and flows of coverage of climate change over time, month to month. \"It's not an exhaustive reading of all media accounts everywhere around the globe across all platforms, but rather is a way to get us talking productively. \"In 2004 there were relatively low levels of coverage. Around 2006, into 2007 there was an uptick. There was a high water mark in 2009 [at the time of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]. There was a high water mark. The high water mark occurred in 2009. The high water mark was related to the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. \"From that high water mark to 2014, coverage has dropped: 36% globally; 26% in the US; and as much as 55% in the UK. \"Within the last year here in the United States, National Public Radio reduced its environment reporting team from three to one reporter. \"We see examples of this unfolding quite regularly. There's certainly newsroom pressures. There's shrinking time to deadline, there's reduced resources to cover complex issues such as climate change that require a certain level of investigation, a certain level of familiarity with the contours and the nuances of the topics.\" Jennifer Morgan is the Global Director of the climate change programme at the World Resources Institute. \"Copenhagen was supposed to be the moment when over 190 countries came together and agreed a new legally binding agreement to address climate change. Copenhagen was a moment. Copenhagen was supposed to be a moment. Copenhagen was a moment when over 190 countries came together. Copenhagen was a moment to agree a new legally binding agreement. Copenhagen was a moment to address climate change. It was very much a great excitement and anticipation of trying to finally get a global agreement after the Kyoto years. \"I remember walking in with a colleague of mine, and saying 'Okay, we have to do it. We have to get this done, these moments don't happen very often'. \"But it soon became clear that negotiations weren't going to plan:. \"In the middle of the second week normally what happens is the options start to get narrowed down, and you can see the package emerging. That wasn't happening, and that's when we all started to get very concerned.\" China's chief negotiator was barred by security for the first few days, sessions were routinely suspended in the name of finishing on time, developing countries said they were ignored, and the EU was missing from a final meeting where a last-minute, non-binding deal was drawn up. \"It was terrible. [We felt] an exhausted defeat, just a deep fatigue, particularly from the European side, of just wanting to take a break. The personal sacrifice - it sounds crazy - but believing and trying to make something happen, I think it was a trauma, just to put so much blood, sweat and tears into it. \"Right after Copenhagen, there was a sense that there needed to be a bit of a time out on the world leaders' side of things. So it definitely went into a very low level of attention for a few years. The relationships of some of the Heads of State after Copenhagen were quite strained. \"Even months after, it was almost like [they] had been being psychologically burned by this. \"That's had a real impact on the willingness of these individuals to stay engaged.\" Environmental psychologist Robert Gifford researches why even those who accept a link between human behaviour and climate change are reluctant to act. \"Our brain physically hasn't developed much for about 30,000 years. At that time we were mostly wandering around on the Savannah, and our main concerns were very immediate: feeding ourselves right now, worrying about anybody who might try to take our territory.

Obviously we're capable of planning, but the kind of default is to stick into the here and now, which is not very good for thinking about climate change, which is a problem that, for many people, is more in the future and farther away, or at least we think it is. \"[And] as any advertiser knows, if you don't change your message people will just tune out. And so environmental numbness is 'yes, I've heard that message before'. We're always open to new messages, and paying more attention to new messages.

We've learned in my own laboratory from experimental evidence that when people feel a bit uncertain about an environmental problem - if the future temperature might vary from a half a degree increase to a one and a half degrees increase - people will say 'well, it's probably only going to be a half a degree increase, so I'll keep flying to some tropical place'. \"It's a natural human tendency to interpret information in a way that suits our personal interests. Joe Smith teaches geography at the Open University and argues the narrative around climate science must evolve. \"I'm not sure that people need to engage with climate change at all. It's more or less unreportable if you just describe it on the page. It's complex, interdisciplinary, the findings drip out over time, and the boundary between science and policy and politics is a very messy one. It's a real challenge for the media. \"The idea that we will mobilise any more people with fear messaging is wrong. I think we've knocked at the door of everyone that might respond to such a thing, but you've also got to ask whether it's an accurate way of telling the science. I think it is more respectful to the nature of the science to say that it's one of humanity's most ambitious questions. \"There was a tactical wrong turning in suggesting that by insisting that the debate is over, we can move onto the action. It somehow implied that the science was complete, and that, of course, left lots of space for those people who have arguments about the actions on climate change to stand in the way of us having a proper public conversation about those actions because they were able to pick apart minor details in the science. \"It's not just that climate science isn't finished, it's actually unfinishable. \"The rest of science - particle physics, cosmology - is allowed to be rather saucy. I would love to get to the point where we allow climate change science to simply be interesting, enchanting even, as fascinating as any area of science because it's a hugely ambitious and compelling mission. \"If you want to talk to a business person, you talk about energy security for their business or energy security for their nation. If you want to talk to a parent at the school gate, you talk to them about the health of their child, their experience of the trip to school - wouldn't they be happier walking and cycling? \"Talking about climate change doesn't have to involve 'talking about climate change' to lead us to some really substantial actions. \"We don't need to wear a climate change t-shirt.\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT.

US Secretary of State John Kerry has said Turkey would need to provide \"evidence, not allegations\" against Mr Gulen, who has denied any involvement in the plot.

        "document": "But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. \"Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?\" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. \"If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,\" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. \"We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. \"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. His business has grown. The popularity of mead in the US has grown. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. \"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says. \"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. \"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander. \"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. The mead of the past was often sweet. The mead of the past didn't appeal to many drinkers. The drinkers were looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed. \"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers. Yet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself. Technically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US. This means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet. \"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe. Ironically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer. The craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire. \"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan. \"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" After he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially. So when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge. Now, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country. But for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning. \"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander. \"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage. \"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"",

        "document": "Assistant nurse Emilie Telander, 26, cheers as one of the day patients at Svartedalen's elderly care home in Gothenburg manages to roll a six in a game of Ludo. But her smile fades as she describes her own luck running out at the end of the year, when after 23 months of six-hour shifts, she was told to go back to eight-hour days. \"I feel that I am more tired than I was before,\" she reflects, lamenting the fact that she now has less time at home to cook or read with her four-year-old daughter. \"During the trial all the staff had more energy. A trial took place. The staff had more energy during the trial. I could see that everybody was happy.\" Ms Telander is one of about 70 assistant nurses who had their days shortened for the experiment, the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Sweden involving a range of employers, from start-ups to nursing homes. Designed to measure well-being in a sector that's struggling to recruit enough staff to care for the country's ageing population, extra nurses were brought in to cover the lost hours. The project's independent researchers were also paid to study employees at a similar care home who continued to work regular days. Their final report is due out next month, but data released so far strongly backs Ms Telander's arguments. During the first 18 months of the trial the nurses working shorter hours logged less sick leave, reported better perceived health and boosted their productivity by organising 85% more activities for their patients, from nature walks to sing-a-longs. However, the project also faced tough criticism from those concerned that the costs outweighed the benefits. Centre-right opponents filed a motion calling on Gothenburg City Council to wrap it up prematurely last May, arguing it was unfair to continue investing taxpayers' money in a pilot that was not economically sustainable. Saved from the axe at the eleventh hour, the trial managed to stay within budget, but still cost the city about 12 million kronor (Â£1.1m; $1.3m). \"Could we do this for the entire municipality? The answer is no, it will be too expensive,\" says Daniel Bernmar, the Left Party councillor responsible for running Gothenburg's elderly care. But he argues the experiment still proved \"successful from many points of view\" by creating extra jobs for 17 nurses in the city, reducing sick pay costs and fuelling global debates about work culture. \"It's put the shortening of the work day on the agenda both for Sweden and for Europe, which is fascinating,\" he says. The speaker is talking about the shortening of the work day. The speaker mentions Sweden and Europe. The speaker finds it fascinating. \"In the past 10, 15 years there's been a lot of pressure on people working longer hours and this is sort of the contrary of that.\" Yet while work-life balance is already championed across the political spectrum in Sweden, the chances of the Nordic country trimming back its standard 40-hour week remain slim. On a national level, the Left Party is the only parliamentary party in favour of shortening basic working hours, backed by just 6% of voters in Sweden's last general election. Nevertheless, a cluster of other Swedish municipalities are following in Gothenburg's footsteps, with locally funded trials targeting other groups of employees with high levels of illness and burnout, including social workers and hospital nurses. A cluster of other Swedish municipalities are following in Gothenburg's footsteps. Gothenburg is a Swedish municipality. Gothenburg has a locally funded trial. The trial in Gothenburg targets other groups of employees with high levels of illness and burnout. The groups of employees targeted by the trial in Gothenburg include social workers and hospital nurses. Cleaners at Skelleftea Hospital will begin an 18-month project next month. There's also been an increase in pilots in the private sector, with advertising, consulting, telecoms and technology firms among those testing the concept. Yet while some have also reported that staff appear calmer or are less likely to phone in sick, others have swiftly abandoned the idea. \"I really don't think that the six-hour day fits with an entrepreneurial world, or the start-up world,\" argues Erik Gatenholm, chief executive of Gothenburg-based bio-ink company. He is candid enough to admit he tested the method on his production staff after \"reading about the trend on Facebook\" and musing on whether it could be an innovative draw for future talent. But the firm's experiment was ditched in less than a month, after bad feedback from employees. \"I thought it would be really fun, but it felt kind of stressful,\" says Gabriel Peres, as he slots a Petri dish inside one of the 3D printers he's built for the company. \"It's a process and it takes time and when you don't have all that [much] time it kind of feels like skipping homework at school, things are always building up.\" On the other side of the country, his concerns are shared by Dr Aram Seddigh, who recently completed his doctorate at Stockholm University's Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation's shifting work patterns. \"I think the six-hour work day would be most effective in organisations - such as hospitals - where you work for six hours and then you just leave [the workplace] and go home. \"It might be less effective for organisations where the borders between work and private life are not so clear,\" he suggests. \"This kind of solution might even increase stress levels given that employees might try to fit all the work that they have been doing in eight hours into six - or if they're office workers they might take the work home.\" Back in Gothenburg, Bengt Lorentzon, the lead researcher for the Svartedalen care home project, argues that the concept of six-hour days also jars with the strong culture of flexible working promoted by many Swedish businesses. \"A lot of offices are already working almost like consultancies. There's no need for managers to have all their workers in the office at the same time, they just want to get the results and people have to deliver,\" he says. \"Compare that to the assistant nurses - they can't just leave work to go to the dentist or to the doctors or the hairdressers.\" \"So I don't think people should start with the question of whether or not to have reduced hours. \"First, it should be: what can we do to make the working environment better? And maybe different things can be better for different groups. \"It could be to do with working hours and working times, but it could be a lot of other things as well.\" Listen to Maddy Savage's report on Sweden's experiment with six-hour days on The World Tonight.",

Schools and education staff can help. Schools and education staff can help by opening discussion with parents. Schools and education staff can help by scrutinising holiday requests.

Schools and education staff can help from members of communities that practise FGM. \"They should be vigilant for the signs of FGM such as frequent toilet visits and pain whilst sitting down. Schools should publicise the NSPCC's FGM helpline to pupils, parents and staff. \"We must aim to empower girls by discussion in age-appropriate PSHE [personal, social and health education] lessons delivered by trained teachers. \"We must equally empower boys to challenge this practice. Do they want this for their sisters, daughters, girlfriends or wives?\" Ms Porter said the practice of FGM should never be described as female circumcision, as there was no medical benefit and rarely any anaesthetic used. She said the term female circumcision was \"equivalent to describing deforestation as rainforest topiary\". Ms Porter said: \"FGM is child abuse. It is a violation of a child's human rights, and according to the United Nations is a cruel, inhumane and degrading torture that should be eliminated.\" Tendai Mashapure, from Cambridgeshire, said: \"We need to commit ourselves to the creation of an enabling environment where individuals are empowered to make decisions based on the best interest of their children. \"FGM will not end only by targeting those who practise FGM, but rather by engaging with all families, focusing on youth who will be future parents and targeting the leaders who have influence over community members. \"In other words, by reducing the demand for the practice, it will eventually become obsolete.\" ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: \"Teachers have been put in a position of great responsibility. What they need now is clear guidance on how to fulfil those responsibilities. \"They need a clear system for reporting their concerns.\" Dr Bousted welcomed the letter that Education Secretary Michael Gove sent to schools last term, urging them to protect girls at risk from what he described as \"this very serious form of child abuse\". FGM includes procedures that remove or injure female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility, mental health problems, complications in childbirth and increased risk of death for newborns. Two men were charged last month, in connection with performing FGM, under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. They were the first people in Britain to face such charges. The NSPCC children's charity set up a 24-hour FGM helpline last year.",

Storm Desmond began battering parts of the UK on 5 December, depositing a record month's worth of rain on Cumbria in just one day. About 5,200 homes were flooded in Cumbria and Lancashire, while tens of thousands more lost power after an electricity sub-station in Lancaster was flooded. The storm caused an estimated insurance bill of more than Â£1.3bn. Major storms \"Abigail\", \"Frank\" and \"Gertrude\" also hit the UK last winter. A study by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), in collaboration with the British Hydrological Society, found many rivers across northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland saw record peak flows during the three-month period.

The coalition brought in a three month ban on EU citizens getting out-of-work benefits ahead of work restrictions being lifted for Bulgarians and Romanians on 1 January. But Mr Farage, whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years, said the government should go much further. Mr Farage is a politician. Mr Farage's party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years. Mr Farage said the government should go much further. He said the cost of migrants claiming in-work welfare payments, such as child benefit, housing benefit and tax credits, had not been factored in to the government's calculations. \"We must be completely mad, as a country, to be giving people from Eastern Europe in-work benefits,\" he told BBC News. And he said lower economic growth was a price worth paying for cutting immigration. \"Even if I thought, which I don't, there was an economic benefit to mass immigration some things are more important than money, namely the shape of our society and giving our own youngsters a chance to work.\" London Mayor Boris Johnson also weighed in to the debate, suggesting the ban on EU citizens claiming benefits should be two years. Labour said it supported the government's three-month ban, which it said was \"reasonable and achievable\". Downing Street said withholding benefits from migrants for longer periods may be illegal. \"We are doing all that we can within the law,\" said a No 10 spokesman. Downing Street also confirmed ministers were examining measures to curb the ability of migrants to claim child benefit for children in their native countries. Downing Street confirmed ministers were examining measures. The measures are to curb the ability of migrants to claim child benefit. The child benefit is for children in their native countries. The British Social Attitudes Survey suggests more than three-quarters of Britons want to see a cut in immigration - and 56% want to see a major crackdown. Almost half of those surveyed, 47%, thought immigration was bad for the economy, and among the 31% of respondents who said it was good for the economy, half wanted to see immigration reduced anyway. The figures are revealed in a BBC Two documentary called The Truth About Immigration, to be broadcast later on Tuesday. Business Secretary Vince Cable tells the programme the government's target of cutting net migration to below 100,000 by 2015 is \"not helpful\" and will almost certainly not be achieved. Mr Cable, who has sought to distance himself from the net migration target in the past, calling it a Conservative and not a coalition policy, said politicians on all sides must be \"practical\" and accept that net migration cannot be controlled. \"It involves British people emigrating - you can't control that. It involves free movement within the European Union - in and out. It involves British people coming back from overseas who are not immigrants but are counted in the numbers,\" he says. \"Setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful. It almost certainly won't achieve the below-100,000 level the Conservatives are setting - so let's be practical about it.\" Labour said the \"gap between the government's rhetoric and reality on immigration is continuing to undermine public confidence\". Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said Mr Cable should toughen up enforcement of the minimum wage and prevent employment agencies recruiting solely from abroad. David Cameron promised to cut net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those emigrating -  from more than 250,000 a year to less than 100,000 by the next election in 2015. After some initial success, the latest figures show net migration is on the rise again, going up from 167,000 to 182,000 a year, largely because fewer Britons were emigrating to eurozone countries. Asked last month if that meant it would be impossible to meet his target, Mr Cameron said: \"'I don't accept that.\" \"If you take the whole three-year period [since the election], net immigration is down by around third.\" He said some measures the government had taken, such as closing \"bogus\" colleges and tightening up the rules on family reunion, would take time to have an impact. In Nick Robinson's documentary, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says the Labour government of which he was a prominent member \"got it wrong\" on immigration, \"and I deeply regret it\". Labour MP and former Home Secretary David Blunkett adds: \"We didn't spell out in words of one syllable what was happening, partly because of a fear of racism.\" Nigel Farage tells the programme: \"They tried to rubbish us, they tried to say that anybody that dared to talk about this subject was necessarily a bad person and racist, that was what they tried to do and actually this has been going on ever since [Enoch] Powell's speech.\" In the so-called \"rivers of blood\" speech, made in 1968, Mr Powell said Britain's immigration policy was like watching a nation \"heaping up its own funeral pyre\". He was sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet by party leader Edward Heath, who said it was \"inflammatory and liable to damage race relations\". Asked whether he thought Mr Powell had been right, Mr Farage says: \"He was right for the wrong reasons. He was wrong in the sense that he felt that black and white would find it difficult to mix, but unfortunately he's been proved to be right because the sheer numbers that have come into Britain have led to segregation.\" BBC political editor Nick Robinson says all political parties now \"promise to control\" immigration because they are \"acutely aware of the high level of public concern\" about it. In the programme, he looks back to a civil service paper published in 2001 which examined the economic and the social impact of immigration. The paper concluded that there was \"little evidence that native workers are harmed by migration\". Its author, former Cabinet Office economist Jonathan Portes, said: \"I think politicians do have to say to individuals who are negatively affected, and let's face it there will be some: 'Yes, we're doing this for the good of our country, and yes you may lose out, but ultimately we still have to do this.' \"Just as we said to the coal miners 30 years ago: 'Sorry we can get our coal a lot cheaper abroad. We can't afford to keep on propping you up.'\" The Truth About Immigration is to be broadcast on BBC Two at 21:30 GMT on Tuesday, 7 January.",

        "document": "For this has been the worst year on this, or indeed any other, commissioner's watch. As the league closes in on an annual revenue of £16bn ($25bn), expansion plans into Europe and specifically London, continue apace. And as Goodell tops up his bank balance with a yearly income in the region of £26m ($40m), the professional game of American Football is more popular and yet, some would argue, more contemptible than ever. Fifty NFL players were arrested in 2014 for a wide degree of offences - from Tennessee's Shonn Greene, who parked in a disabled parking bay, to Minnesota's Adrian Peterson, who was arrested over child abuse. There were five cases of domestic violence, including that of Baltimore's Ray Rice, who was filmed by hotel security punching his then fiancee - now wife - in a lift. Goodell himself became personally embroiled in the Rice case in an argument over what the NFL did or did not know. There was also a far-reaching report chaired by the former director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, which highlighted the fundamental mismanagement of the situation by league officials. And the bad news kept on coming for the embattled commissioner. Just 30 days into 2015, there have been four fresh player arrests, including two for domestic violence and one for rape. Elsewhere, it is a sorry tale:. Yet despite all this mayhem and chaos the NFL, as a product, is flourishing. The moral outrage surrounding the cases of Rice and Peterson calmed down fairly quickly and audiences flocked yet again to stadiums around the country. More than 17m attended the 256 regular season games, the highest figure since 2008, while television audiences hit record highs. Media playback is not supported on this device. While youth participation figures are down over concerns surrounding long-term brain damage caused by concussion, NFL fans are embracing the game like never before, both within the United States and globally. The annual Harris Report, which tracks the popularity of American sports, says the NFL is still number one by a huge margin - double the popularity of Major League Baseball and College Football. A report released this week by the sports market research group Repucom also makes some interesting claims, notably that:. Most of the television networks that broadcast the NFL had audiences tuning in in greater numbers than in 2013, while the figures for both Thursday and Monday Night Football were up significantly. More than 47m people watched the NFL's annual College Draft, yet not one pass was thrown or one tackle made. There were also 9.6m tweets about the event across its three days. Nielsen, who gather audience ratings in the US, reported extremely strong numbers for the very first 9.30am EST kick-off between Detroit and Atlanta in London, so much so that the NFL will repeat the experiment next season. Although some fans showed their disdain for Rice, Peterson and others arrested last year by returning their replica shirts, many still turned up wearing Rice's number 27 jersey and Peterson's number 28 long after their cases made the national press. Despite everything, the NFL remains America's game. So why the appeal in the face of growing off-field problems? Simply put, the NFL is full of great stories, exceptional games and, most importantly, great players. The college version of the game is flourishing as well. The college version of the game is flourishing. Elsewhere in America, the other two major professional leagues - the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB) - have suffered with falling television ratings and general popularity over the past few years. Baseball's lack of true star power means it has fallen out of the national conversation, arguably since 1998 and the infamous home-run record chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who have subsequently become embroiled in steroid controversies. The names of baseball's 2014 All Stars, such as Chase Utley, Nelson Cruz and Paul Goldschmidt, do not possess the same pulling power as football stars such as JJ Watt, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers or Calvin Johnson. Baseball simply is not cool anymore and the appeal for the game has become as much regional as it is national. Jonathan Mahler wrote in the New York Times recently that: \"Baseball has never been healthier\" - in terms of attendance, revenue, and, unlike the NFL and NBA, freedom from labour strife. \"So why does it feel so irrelevant?\" With each team playing 162 games a season, baseball fans tend to watch their own players in action rather than those they have no vested interest in. That is not the case for the NFL. The NFL is not the case. The NFL is not the same as the case. Almost 19m watched the Dallas Cowboys take on the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football. The NBA has also suffered in the post-Michael Jordan years, with falling attendances and viewing figures. However basketball has been rescued somewhat by the LeBron James effect, while the game, with its ongoing connection with hip hop culture, continues to grow with a younger audience. Along with the phenomenon that is College Basketball's March Madness, it remains a popular sport in America, but continues to be dwarfed by the NFL. The NBA is, according to the Harris Report, America's sixth most popular sport but is struggling with the increase in popularity of soccer and a resurgence in appreciation for ice hockey. It would also be foolish to think that the NFL is the only organisation with off-field problems. Baseball continues to move from one steroid scandal to another, while the NBA has witnessed its own fair share of domestic violence, domestic assault, battery and driving under the influence cases. The NFL is a runaway success train that shows no sign of halting. And while the on-field product remains so good, the off-field issues will be nothing more than a distraction. Green Bay Packers fan Zoe Lake is representative of millions: \"Football has always been a part of my life. As a football fan and a woman, I believe the NFL needs to take a good, hard look at the way it has handled the epidemic of violence that has rocked the league and the nation. \"But recent events will not keep me from tuning in to catch my Packers. Let's not forget: It is only a small number of NFL players who have committed violent acts against women and children.\" In April's Draft, commissioner Goodell will welcome University of Oklahoma wide receiver Dorial Green Beckham into the professional ranks, potentially in the first round. Multiple drug arrests and a dismissal from the University of Missouri for allegedly forcing open an apartment door and pushing an 18-year-old woman down a flight of stairs will not stop him being given every opportunity to succeed on the field. Even if he transgresses again, it will be just another problem for America's most popular sport. But a problem it will overcome, have no doubt.",

Mr Thompson expressed his opinion on image rights. Mr Thompson said he would want to review this issue if he was in the same situation. It is quite difficult to explain to a football fan that that is the law.\" The HMRC's head of enforcement, Jennie Grainger, said that 43 players, eight agents and 12 football clubs were under investigation. Ms Granger said HMRC has a dedicated team looking at image rights, football, other sports, and the entertainment industry. She told the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC): \"Just on football itself, in the last two years, that team, and wider across HMRC, has brought in £158m in yield.\" Ms Granger said HMRC is investigating whether some claims to separate image rights earnings from earnings as players are genuine. \"Has it been properly transferred? Has it been transferred for a fair value? Should there be income coming back to the UK depending on their residency status? All of those issues can be part of this,\" she said. The officials also told the PAC that HMRC had seven criminal investigations under way and had made arrests following publication of the Panama Papers, which provided a huge amount of information about the tax affairs of wealthy individuals. The action follows the formation of an inter-agency task force six months ago, including HMRC, the FCA, the Serious Fraud Office and National Crime Agency. At the weekend, the PAC's chairwoman, Meg Hillier, said the tax affairs of football manager Jose Mourinho should be investigated by British officials, following allegations that he used offshore companies to reduce his tax bill. Mourinho is accused of moving millions of pounds of earnings to the British Virgin Islands to avoid paying tax. According to reports in the Sunday Times, Portuguese-born Mourinho, 53, placed £10m (€12m) into a Swiss account owned by a British Virgin Islands (BVI) firm, which it suggests has no employees. The newspaper also claims that Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo used bank accounts and companies in Ireland, Switzerland and New Zealand to process substantial earnings for their image rights. However, Mr Jorge Mendes - the agent for both Mourinho and ex-Manchester United player Ronaldo - denies both claims. He says both men were fully compliant with UK and Spanish tax rules. The statement added that the allegations stemmed from a cyber-attack earlier this year on some sports agents, details of which were prohibited by a Spanish court from being published. HMRC said it would not comment on named individuals, but took \"all allegations of tax evasion extremely seriously\" and \"always investigates allegations of fraud together with any intelligence provided\".

        "document": "What did the court say? The court made a decision. Until now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work. On Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day. The European Court of Justice made a judgement on Thursday. The judgement was about those without a fixed or habitual office. The judgement ruled that those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day. The ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive. I'm a care worker who travels to different patients' homes. Am I affected? Possibly, yes. Employees who fall into the category loosely defined as \"mobile workers\" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected. Simon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category. As many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC. And some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds. I travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office. The ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says. There may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office. I have to commute two hours every day to my office. For those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the \"overwhelming majority\" in the UK. I think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours? The ruling could eventually affect pay. The ruling is about pay. The ruling could affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account). That could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up. It could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum. \"I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have,\" Mr Tutton said. We have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling. Here is a selection of their comments:. This is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester. I am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge. I am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon. I currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow. I am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford. I'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our \"pickup\" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset. I am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley. I'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere.

        "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device. It began when he left behind a glamorous Manhattan lifestyle for the wonder and wastelands of Sierra Leone five years ago. It will end when he walks through the front door of the family home in Lisburn, Belfast for Christmas, having lived through an incredible time in modern history. Very few 29-year-olds have managed a national football team. None have done it while that country is being brought to its knees by Ebola. \"I'm very sad, very emotional,\" he said. \"Saying goodbye to Sierra Leone was very emotional, very difficult. I don't keep my distance from things; I invest emotionally. The country has become part of me.\" Having been an academy coach with the New York Red Bulls, McKinstry was appointed technical director of the Craig Bellamy academy in Sierra Leone at the age of 24. By 27, he was manager of the national team. Within 18 months his squad were in the top 50 of the world rankings for the first time. \"I've made a career of proving doubters wrong,\" he said. Two months ago he was sacked by email, as the Ebola outbreak gathered momentum. \"We believed we had the chemistry, cohesion and spirit to achieve anything. But the Ebola outbreak changed everything. Circumstances meant that, in the end, it was an impossible job.\" McKinstry stepped off a plane four hours before we met in a London hotel. He had not slept for the best part of two days. The journey to Freetown Airport had to be made by boat to avoid some of the areas worst affected by Ebola. An early flight meant crossing the night before. A night at an airport, one plane to Morocco, another to London followed by a medical check by customs officers is no ordinary preparation for an interview. But for a man who has spent much of the past six months living in lockdown, being among the bustle again is a welcome change. His time in Sierra Leone has now come to an end. The memory of it will, however, live on. \"In the last month or so when I went into Freetown for supplies, I started to see more of the Ebola response teams, with the full yellow bio-hazard suits,\" he said. \"You might see an ambulance driving past and even the driver would be in the full bio-hazard gear. \"When you see that it really does bring it home to you just how serious the situation is.\" McKinstry was offered a way out, a safe passage home in July, but refused it. Many of the players in the academy were from affected areas, he felt he had a duty of care not to walk away and send the young footballers into danger. Instead he quarantined the academy behind the gate and walls of the compound. \"When the outbreak started a lot of people ran for cover,\" he said. \"But Ebola is a disease of contact, if you remove the contact, you remove the risk. So that is what we did. We moved everyone who was off site, behind the walls. We had generators for power, bore holes for fresh water, we had dorm rooms, classrooms and a football pitch.\" In Northern Ireland his family were growing increasingly worried about the situation. Did they want him home? \"They wanted information. They wanted to know what was going on, to know that I was safe, that the boys at the academy were safe,\" he said. It is not sensationalist to suggest that the Ebola virus cost McKinstry his job as head coach. But before he explained how it came to an end, he addressed the question of how it all began. \"When it comes to football, confidence has not been something I have been lacking,\" McKinstry said with a smile. \"There is a saying in Newcastle - 'shy bearns get nowt' - if you don't ask you don't get. \"That was my attitude to the Sierra Leone job. I know I was 27 but if they said no, nothing is lost. If they said yes, it was going to be the start of an exciting new chapter.\" McKinstry had watched every Sierra Leone home game in person, every away game on TV, he had watched them train, studied their players. \"I thought I was the best man for the job,\" he added. \"I got in the room with the decision-makers and I went through Sierra Leone's last two games with a fine tooth comb and Tunisia's last two, who would be our next opponents. \"I outlined how I'd beat Tunisia, how I saw the future. Every member of the panel went away with a dossier, which I told them they could keep and use even if they didn't choose me. \"Two days later they offered me the job.\" McKinstry made an impressive start, losing just one of his first six matches and leading Sierra Leone into the top 50 of Fifa's world rankings, above Northern Ireland, the Republic, Cameroon and Senegal. Then the Ebola outbreak happened and football became a side issue. \"We looked at what little we could do as sporting heroes, could we put smiles on the faces of the nation?\" McKinstry said. McKinstry made a statement. \"Football is a second religion in Sierra Leone. \"So when the national team wins, the national psyche is buoyed, everyone walks an inch or two taller. We made a commitment to keep on winning to try to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations so that people in the country would feel a little bit better. Unfortunately it wasn't to work out that way.\" The Confederation of African Football ruled that Sierra Leone could not play games at home. A challenging task was becoming a near-impossible one. \"In football, the home team tends to win 50% of the time. In Africa, the home team wins 65 or 70% of the time,\" McKinstry explained. That was not the only complication. \"In my final game, against DR Congo, we had 17,000 fans just chanting 'Ebola, Ebola, Ebola' at us. It was upsetting for our players. The atmosphere was difficult. It made the players angry that people were mocking the situation in their homeland,\" he said. Sierra Leone players found opponents unwilling to shake hands, hotels unwilling to check them in and governments uncertain on granting them entry. \"People fear things they don't know,\" he said. \"Hotel arrangements were monitored wherever we went, there were daily medical checks for my players and, while that is not overly difficult, it can impact on players' mental state.\" Sierra Leone's first group game as they attempted to qualify for the African Cup of Nations was away to Ivory Coast in early September. With a week to go, McKinstry was still unsure whether he and his players would be allowed into the country. The confusion meant some players had to buy their own plane tickets. Others arrived the night before the game. Sierra Leone led for an hour, only to lose 2-1. The demands of their schedule meant the squad left at 11pm that night to fly to DR Congo for a 'home' qualifier that was to be played in the away team's stadium. That game too ended in a 2-0 defeat and was marred by chants of 'Ebola, Ebola.' McKinstry did not see the end coming. He said: \"I had been in the FA building that day and not once was anything mentioned. I was driving back home, over a mountain pass, when my phone buzzed with an email from one of the men I'd been speaking to, not two hours earlier. It said they had terminated my contract. I was disappointed. I'd been standing in their office a few hours earlier. \"But I believe in a certain way of doing things. So I spun the car around, went straight back to the FA, not to argue with them but just to go in shake hands and say 'best of luck for the future and it has been a pleasure for the past 18 months.'\" McKinstry has a voracious appetite for football and for learning, he lives and breathes it and his sense of adventure means predicting his next move is not easy. In the New Year he has a series of meetings in Asia. This is not a man who does things by the book. Having been a coach from the age of 15, McKinstry already has miles on the clock. The boyhood Newcastle United fan still dreams of taking charge at St James' Park or leading his native Northern Ireland out. \"Nothing would make me prouder, my heart would be beating out of my chest for both those opportunities at some stage in my career.\" Watch the full interview with Johnny McKinstry - Football Focus, BBC One on Saturday 20 December at 12:10 GMT.",

The son of the former Fine Gael politician Hugh Coveney, the Cork-born 44-year-old has followed his father's footsteps to a seat in the Dáil (Irish parliament). As a teenager, he was expelled from the exclusive Clongowes Wood boarding school for drinking and bunking off to attend a beach party. In a candid interview with RTÉ, he said he had suffered from a stutter, and lived in the shadow of his more promising brother, who is now a successful businessman. He went on to study management at the Royal Agricultural College in Gloucestershire, England, before his election as the youngest member of the Dáil in 1998. He was appointed as agriculture minister in 2011 and responsibility for defence was added to his portfolio three years later. He has made no secret of his desire to lead his party - when RTÉ asked the question about his intentions, he said: \"I am very ambitious, so the straight answer is yes, some day. \"But I am personally very loyal to Enda and he knows that.\" The speaker is expressing loyalty.

Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life. Nasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home. It is around 1,400 light years away from Earth. Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\" The new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth. The new world is an exoplanet. The new world is similar to Earth in many ways. Kepler-186f is another exoplanet. Kepler-186f is similar to Earth in many ways. Determining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own. Kepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's. The mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet. The new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars. Twelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star. This zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met. Of these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet. 500 candidates were identified. Kepler-452b is a planet. Kepler-452b is confirmed as a planet. Dr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date. \"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue. \"It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.\" While similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b's host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth. \"If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,\" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission. \"The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.\" \"Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.\" Dr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: \"Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet. \"However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make. \"So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.\" Dr Chris Watson, from Queen's University Belfast, UK, commented: \"Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii. \"In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a 'Super-Earth' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really 'Earth-like' given all this?\" He added: \"When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating. \"So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It's this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.\" The findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal. Follow Paul on Twitter.",

But Mr Pena Nieto later tweeted: \"I made it clear Mexico would not pay for the wall.\" After the meeting, Mr Trump flew to Phoenix, Arizona, to deliver a key speech on tackling illegal immigration. At their joint press conference in Mexico City, Mr Pena Nieto said Mexicans had been hurt by some of Mr Trump's previous comments but he believed he now genuinely wanted to build relations. The New York businessman called Mexicans \"amazing\" and \"spectacular\" people, in contrast to earlier comments branding Mexican migrants \"rapists\" and \"murderers\".

On Wednesday, Donald Trump said Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was his friend. That contrast illustrates how different Diplomatic Donald was from the firebrand candidate who tore through the Republican primaries by flogging his opponents for being soft on illegal immigration and border security. If the goal of Mr Trump's visit to Mexico City was to represent his nation on the world stage without the kind of embarrassment or controversy that Hillary Clinton warns would be certain if he is elected, then his last-minute trip was a success. But his surprise appearance south of the border may come with a price. It is likely to make it more difficult for him to back away from hard-line immigration positions that are unpopular among moderate voters. Perhaps more grating for Mr Trump's diehard supporters is that he had the chance to confront the Mexican leader and instead spoke of protecting \"hemispheric manufacturing\" and avoided the subject of who would pay for the border wall. Diplomatic Donald may not be the candidate they thought they were getting. Diplomatic Donald is a candidate. Diplomatic Donald may not be what they thought they were getting. Mr Trump said his words to Mr Pena Nieto had been strong and straightforward. He tried to put behind him his previous comments on Mexicans by saying those in the US had made a \"great contribution\". \"I have a great feeling for Mexicans. They are amazing people,\" he said. Mr Trump said he had employed many Mexicans and that they were \"spectacular people with strong values of faith and community\". He went on to list five points he had set out in his talks:. Mr Trump said: \"We recognise and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders.\" Mr Trump made a statement. The statement made by Mr Trump was about the right of a country to build a physical barrier or wall on its borders. The statement made by Mr Trump mentioned either country. But he said there was no discussion on who would pay for the wall. He had earlier threatened to stop cash earned by Mexicans based in the US being sent home until the country paid for it to be built. Mr Trump concluded by saying he was honoured by Mr Pena Nieto's invitation to visit, adding: \"I call you a friend.\" Mr Pena Nieto accepted there were border challenges but pointed out the massive contribution Mexicans have made to the US, and that \"six million jobs rely on exports to Mexico\". He said: \"My priority is to protect Mexicans wherever they may be. Mexicans in the US are honest people, hard-working people who respect their families, their community and the law. They deserve everybody's respect.\" Mr Pena Nieto has invited both US candidates to visit, but has faced criticism at home over Mr Trump. Ex-President Vicente Fox earlier told CNN: \"We don't like him. We don't want him.

Or is it a case of what next? Even the most upbeat of Leicester fans would probably find it difficult to be positive about their Premier League title defence as the stats make for pretty grim reading - played 19, won five, drawn five and lost nine. To put that in some context, City lost just three times in the league last season. City lost three times in the league last season. However, Claudio Ranieri's side are through to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will meet Sevilla for a place in the quarter finals. And after that, only the small matter of European giants such as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona would stand in the way of European glory... Season ticket holder Sam Webster remains quietly confident, but does not think the Foxes can go all the way in Europe.

Despite an initial surge in bookings, Mr Ferro believes it will wear off eventually. \"It is too soon to say [whether things will quieten down] because they are in the Champions League,\" he said. \"But I would say, yes, things are eventually going to quieten down unless something else happens.\" So, as Leicester looks ahead to 2017, will good things come in threes with Champions League glory for the Foxes?

        "document": "In a scrappy first half, Joe Garner drew a save from Aberdeen keeper Joe Lewis and crossed for Martyn Waghorn to volley over. Aberdeen dominated after the break as Wes Foderingham saved from Kenny McLean and twice from striker Adam Rooney. But Kenny Miller's brace and Joe Dodoo's third earned Rangers the win. Aberdeen are still well placed to finish runners-up to Premiership champions Celtic, with nine points and a far superior goal difference separating them from Rangers with only six games remaining. Derek McInnes's men started the match as favourites and the early signs suggested they would live up to their billing as they pressed, fought and chased Rangers across every inch of the pitch. It was more a bruising battle than a beautiful game, though, and referee Kevin Clancy was flashing cards early, with Garner and Ryan Jack the first to be booked as they squared up to each other. For all its lack of free-flowing football, it was a very watchable spectacle. Jonny Hayes forced a low save from Foderingham at one end and Waghorn should have burst the net rather than volleying over after a sumptuous cross from Garner on the right. The visitors actually enjoyed the best chances in the early stages despite their lack of fluidity in midfield. Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha said beforehand that his players were entering hell with this trip but it looked more like limbo as both sides continued to cancel each other out. The Portuguese was also well aware that anything other than victory would see his side consigned to third at best. The Ibrox side have obvious frailties at the moment, especially in defence where youngsters are deputising for more experienced injured regulars, but they showed fight and spirit that would be rewarded later in the match. Young David Bates looked slow and ponderous at times although Myles Beerman at left-back was composed and calm when needed. When Aberdeen click, it is mostly down to the hard work of their impressive wide men and so it was in the second half as Niall McGinn and Hayes terrorised the Rangers full-backs. Hayes skipped past two on his way to the box but Graeme Shinnie's hooked shot was blocked by Foderingham. McGinn was at it on the other side and his trickery was feeding Rooney but his fellow Irishman could not convert despite several gilt-edged invitations. You could sense the tide turning though and Rangers were struggling to contain the waves of red battering their defences. For all their efforts though, few chances were seriously testing Foderingham. With 11 minutes remaining, veteran striker Miller scored his 10th goal in 40 appearances this season. Against the run of play, Waghorn created space for himself in the box and when his shot was saved, 37-year-old Miller lashed a fabulous effort high into the back of the net. Aberdeen had no time to compose themselves before Miller made it two when he skipped through a defence in disarray to slide neatly past Lewis and send the small band of Rangers fans wild. Substitute Dodoo played his part in that second goal and he slammed home a third to complete an incredible five minute turnaround that sent the Dons fans scurrying for the exits in disbelief. Those who remained in defiance almost witnessed a Miller hat-trick as he followed up on Dodoo's shot that came back off the crossbar but defender Andrew Considine spared further blushes as he cleared off the line.

Mr Putin \"sees me - it's obvious now - as a serious threat\", he said. Once Russia's richest man, the former head of the now defunct Yukos oil firm spent 10 years in a Siberian prison on fraud charges, which he says were politically motivated. Mr Putin pardoned him in 2013 and he now lives abroad, mainly in Switzerland. \"I'm considered by President Putin as a threat, economically, because of the possible seizure of Russian assets abroad, and politically, as someone who will potentially help democratic candidates in the coming 2016 elections,\" he said. Russia will hold elections to the lower house of parliament - the State Duma - next year. The Duma is currently dominated by Mr Putin's supporters.

The question was about Mr Khodorkovsky's safety. The question was related to the murders of prominent opponents of Mr Putin. The murders of prominent opponents of Mr Putin happened in recent years. Among them was former secret agent Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned with radioactive polonium in a London hotel in 2006. \"The history of deaths of opponents of this regime is impressive... but I was in jail for 10 years, I could have been killed any day easily. In London I feel much safer than during those years,\" he replied. When he left Russia in 2013 he said he would not get involved in politics - which was widely believed to have been the reason for his early release. He told the BBC on Wednesday that he would \"help young political activists in Russia to gain political experience and present an alternative to the existing regime\". He said it was \"far too optimistic\" to speak of regime change in Russia now, \"but I'm quite confident that within 10 years the regime will be changed and I hope I will play a significant role in that\". Earlier, referring to the Russian order for his arrest, he said the Moscow authorities had \"gone mad\". He is accused of ordering several of his employees to kill both the mayor and a businessman, who survived. Investigators allege Vladimir Petukhov, the mayor of Nefteyugansk, was killed on 26 June 1998 for demanding Mr Khodorkovsky's oil firm, Yukos, pay taxes that the company had allegedly been avoiding. Local businessman Yevgeny Rybin was allegedly targeted because his activities \"clashed with Yukos's interests\", Russia's powerful Investigative Committee (SK) said in a statement (in Russian). Mr Rybin survived a gun attack in November 1998 and a second attack on his car in March 1999, when another man in the vehicle was killed and several people were injured. Five people have already been tried for the attacks and the arrest warrant is unlikely to make any difference unless Mr Khodorkovsky returns to Russia, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. Armed police raided the Moscow offices of Mr Khodorkovsky's Open Russia pro-democracy movement on Tuesday, in a move that authorities said was linked to allegations of tax evasion. The flats of at least seven activists who work for Mr Khodorkovsky were also searched. After Mr Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, Yukos was broken up and taken over by a state oil firm.

St Michael's Hospital is joining other UK foetal medicine centres. The purpose of joining is to set up a twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) registry. The registry aims to share information. Consultant Mark Denbow said they were \"constantly learning\" about TTTS. He said the \"rare and often devastating condition\" occurs in about 10-15% of identical twin pregnancies. St Michael's Hospital is also one of a few UK centres offering laser ablation surgery, where doctors can operate on the babies while they are in the womb. Jo and Finbarr O'Halloran, from Backwell, said they were \"devastated\" when they discovered  their twins had the syndrome during a hospital scan. Mrs O'Halloran was given laser ablation surgery at about 22 weeks into the pregnancy in 2013. A few weeks later, daughters Eve and Amy were born by emergency caesarean section. Jo O'Halloran said: \"I am literally thankful every single day that they survived and that they're here.\" Keith Reed, from the Twins and Multiple Birth Association (Tamba), said they were \"still only skimming the surface\" in terms of data collection. He said: \"In order to build the best possible picture of TTTS cases in the UK, and help see which treatments offer the best possible outcomes, we need more hospitals with foetal medicine departments to sign up.\" TTTS affects twins who share a placenta, where the babies are not sharing blood equally. TTTS affects twins. Twins share a placenta. The babies are not sharing blood equally. One baby gets too much blood and the other baby does not get enough. If left untreated 90% of these babies will die and even with treatment there is only up to 70% chance of both babies surviving.",

The jihadists have also entered a nearby military base amid further clashes, a military spokesman said. Eastern Mosul was retaken last month. Thursday's advance brings the army within less than a mile (1.6km) of western Mosul, where the militants are expected to launch attacks from densely populated neighbourhoods. After darkness fell, government armour could be seen lining up for a new move forward, the BBC's Quentin Sommerville reports from the scene. Thursday's assault began with air strikes by the US-led coalition before armoured columns advanced to the airport's perimeter. An Iraqi lieutenant was killed by one of the roadside bombs planted in the area by IS, the BBC has learned. Iraqi forces also came under fire from IS militants holed up inside airport buildings, reports said. Iraqi forces were under fire. The source of fire was IS militants. The IS militants were holed up inside airport buildings. Reports said that Iraqi forces came under fire from IS militants. Foreign troops from the US-led coalition were with the attacking troops, officials told the Associated Press news agency, without specifying their nationality. The airport's runway has been destroyed by IS but our correspondent, who is embedded with Iraqi federal police units, says it still has value. It is a large piece of land and controlling it will help secure southern routes to west Mosul, our correspondent says.

The assault is backed by artillery and air power. Leaflets warning residents of an imminent offensive were earlier dropped over western Mosul, where military officials say narrow winding streets could make retaking the area particularly difficult. Although slightly smaller than the east, western Mosul is more densely populated and includes districts seen as pro-IS. The UN has voiced concern about the welfare of civilians trapped in the city. Aram Shakaram, the country deputy director for Save the Children in Iraq, told the BBC he believed relatively few people had been able to escape the city since Wednesday. He said the charity believed that nearly 800,000 people were still trapped there. We are very scared, and we are worried that the final stages are going to take long. S will not give up and withdraw that easily and the whole operation might take as long as it did in east Mosul. I won't lie, I am scared too and I don't know if I am going to die in an air strike or killed by an IS fighter. Voices from West Mosul: 'Everyone is scared' More than 160,000 people have fled their homes in and around the city. The UN said in late January that almost half of all the casualties in Mosul were civilians.

It comes ahead of the publication of a UN inquiry into possible war crimes committed during the war, a report Israel dismissed as a waste of time. The 50-day conflict between Israel and Gaza militants, lasted from July to late August 2014. It left at least 2,189 Palestinians dead, including more than 1,486 civilians, according to the UN. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers were killed along with six civilians. The 277-page report, released by the Israeli foreign ministry, disputed the UN figures, estimating that 2,125 Palestinians had been killed, including 936 militants and 761 civilians, with the status of the remaining casualties unknown. It said that Hamas militants disguised themselves as civilians and converted civilian buildings into military centres. \"This exploitation of civilian surroundings - which often constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity - posed significant operational, legal and ethical challenges for the IDF,\" the report said. \"Harm to the civilian population... occurred as the result of unfortunate - yet lawful - incidental effects of legitimate military action in the vicinity of civilians and their surroundings,\" it added. \"Israel did not intend, and deeply regrets, the harm caused to the Palestinian civilian population and surroundings during the 2014 Gaza Conflict.\" Israel did not intend to harm the Palestinian civilian population and surroundings.

The speaker was amazed by the call. \"I was getting worried that everything was going to plan, and then we hit the fourth-last [fence], and I was kind of delighted once we got back into a rhythm after that that something had gone wrong and it was going to happen coming across the line.\" While there was joy for Mullins, there was frustration for Gigginstown's retained jockey Bryan Cooper, who opted to ride the winner's stable-mate First Lieutenant. They fell at the second. O'Leary had sympathy for Cooper, who rode Don Cossack to victory in last month's Cheltenham Gold Cup. \"Bryan had first choice, and to be fair to him, First Lieutenant has been working out of his skin,\" he said. \"When Bryan made the decision on Thursday or Friday we were expecting good ground - had it been that way it would have been a very different race. \"But the rain came and it favoured horses at the bottom end of the handicap. \"Had Bryan been able to make the decision at three o'clock today he may well have chosen Rule The World. \"That's the problem for retained riders: sometimes they have to make tough decisions and they get it wrong.\" After his National win, Mullins rode Ivan Grozny (16-1) to victory for his uncle in the last race of the day. \"You dream of things like this,\" he said. \"I couldn't ask for much more. and to have a win for Willie is great after he gave me some good rides at Cheltenham.\" Earlier in the day, Paul Townend, replacing the injured Ruby Walsh, had a short-priced double on Yorkhill (3-10 fav) in the Mersey Novices Hurdle and Douvan (2-13 fav) in the Maghull Novices Chase, to help him to the leading jockey award.

        "document": "Not far away, in Brooklyn Bridge Park, where once derelict piers have been converted into outdoor sports centres, the soccer pitches are usually more crowded than the basketball courts. A short walk down the hill, an archway under the Manhattan Bridge last summer hosted one of New York's World Cup \"viewing parties\", where thousands gathered to watch games, and not just those involving the American national team. So it seemed incongruous to stand in front of the courthouse last week, fielding questions from presenters in London about why a country with no interest in football had suddenly assumed the role of global policeman of the global game. That line of inquiry seemed about a decade out of date. It is akin to the blanket condemnation that Americans lack a sense of humour or irony - this in the land of Jon Stewart, Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock, Amy Poehler, Jerry Seinfeld, David Letterman and Garry Shandling. True, football, or soccer as it is known here, is not as central to American as it is to European, African or South and Central American life. Nowhere near. Up until recently, the game has been unloved by the major US television networks, which have long bemoaned the lack of breaks in play, the paucity of goals and the glut of draws. Absent from the US game are big-name male stars and big-name clubs. The New York Red Bulls will never rival the New York Yankees. Real Salt Lake pales, rather risibly, alongside Real Madrid. However, football is no longer met with American indifference. Nor any more does it offer proof of America's sporting isolationism. In this polyglot nation, the game is growing in popularity and importance, an upward trend that will continue long into the future as America becomes less white and more Hispanic. Already, America is the number one country in the world for youth participation in football. More than three million youngsters were registered to play in 2014, compared with just 103,432 in 1974. Major League Soccer matches now have a higher average attendance - 19,148 in 2014 - than basketball and ice hockey. The game ranks third after American football and baseball. Though the crowds here are significantly smaller than in the Bundesliga in Germany, the Premier League in England and Wales, La Liga in Spain or Serie A in Italy, they are on average bigger than in Argentina, Brazil, China or the Football League Championship. Bundesliga: 43,532. Premier League: 36,083. La Liga: 26,803. Serie A: 22,019. Major League Soccer (in 2014): 19,148. The Seattle Sounders, America's most-watched team, attracts larger crowds for home games than Everton, Tottenham, Aston Villa or even Chelsea. The strength of the game in Seattle is also a measure of how its popularity extends well beyond the new immigrant hubs of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Sporting Kansas City, in the American heartland, is also one of the better-supported sides. Last year's World Cup in Brazil witnessed record viewing figures in America, even though the national team did not make it past the final 16. And even after it exited the tournament, viewers kept tuning in - 29.2 million for the final between Germany and Argentina. By comparison, that year's baseball world series attracted 13.5 million. Nor is American enthusiasm for the World Cup a new phenomenon - more than 18 million people watched the 1994 final between Brazil and Italy - but it has been growing. The average viewing figure for matches in last year's World Cup matches was 4.3 million, up 50% from 2010. All those kids who grew up playing the game are now, as adults, watching it. More video:. Soccer seen as â€˜sissyballâ€™ in Deep South. Why US soccer has no relegation. Do Native Americans play football? Football in America also transcends the gender divide. Of the kids playing the game, 48% are girls. The USA has twice won Fifa's Women's World Cup, a record matched only by Germany. Mia Hamm, who accumulated a staggering 275 caps and scored 158 international goals, has been called America's greatest female athlete of the past 40 years. In terms of her marketability, Nike ranked her alongside Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan. It is also worth remembering that one of the most sought after demographics in American politics is the country's army of suburban \"soccer moms.\" The term is hardly new. The term is not new. It was coined in the mid-1990s. Money is another indicator of the game's attractiveness. NBC splashed out $240m (Â£160m) for the rights to Premier League football between 2013-16, three times more than Fox paid for the previous contract. With a fierce bidding war now under way, the next deal is expected to dwarf that figure. The wider availability of Premier League matches, which attract much bigger television audiences than domestic games, is also helping to raise the profile of the sport. Gone are the days when diehard fans used to have to find bars open on a Saturday morning with satellite feeds beamed in from Europe. Now every single Premier League game is available on cable. Ditto the FA Cup and Uefa Champions League. On Univision, the American Spanish language network with viewing figures on a par with the major US networks, soccer, unsurprisingly, is the number one sport. Broadcasting live matches has fuelled the channel's rapid rise. No longer do foreigners have to explain the intricacies of the offside rule to perplexed locals, or why games are allowed to finish in a tie (a draw). Many Americans are now fully literate in the sport. So while American soccer may never rival American football, the notion that it remains a niche sport is absurd. Though gridiron, baseball, basketball and ice hockey are known here as the \"Big Four\" sports, soccer has surely ousted ice hockey to join that quartet. It is the fourth most popular high school sport for boys, and the third for girls. There are many reasons why the US Department of Justice mounted these prosecutions. Two of those indicted, Jeffrey Webb and Chuck Blazer, were dominant figures in the American game. Two of those indicted were Jeffrey Webb and Chuck Blazer. Jeffrey Webb and Chuck Blazer were dominant figures in the American game. Jack Warner, of Trinidad and Tobago, used to head up Concacaf, the Miami-based Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football. Prosecutors claim the alleged bribery scheme relied heavily on the US banking system. But although the US authorities have also targeted foreign nationals, they do not regard soccer as a foreign sport. Announcing the charges, FBI director James Comey stressed how American kids and others at the grassroots had been deprived of resources. The FBI has cast a global dragnet, but this is also a homeland investigation. The Fifa allegations dominated the media here last week, and, paradoxically, that marks another milestone in the game's recognition. The game has moved from the back pages to the front.

        "document": "He was rattling across the arid wastes of the Baluch desert in Pakistan on Saturday morning in that most Afghan of cars - a battered white Toyota Corrola - when the missile, fired from a US drone, struck his vehicle. All that was left was a charred and twisted wreck beside the desert highway. US President Barack Obama described his death as an \"important milestone\", but disentangling what it actually marks is not straightforward. The most obvious question is what it will mean for the Taliban. The Pentagon said it had targeted Mansour because he had become \"an obstacle to peace and reconciliation\". But it isn't clear that the new leader will be any more open towards the peace process. Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhunzada was Mullah Mansour's former deputy, and the official line from the Taliban is that his approach is going to be very similar. What's more, his appointment doesn't rule out the possibility of a battle for succession. Mansour struggled to contain the splintering of the movement into a series of factions that followed the death of Mullah Omar, the founder of the Taliban. That would increase instability in Afghanistan, fuelling local conflicts and entrenching the insurgency. Taliban leader Mullah Mansour killed, Afghans confirm. Afghan Taliban announce successor to Mullah Mansour. Mullah Mansour's battle to be leader. Who are the Taliban? Profile: Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour. Taliban leader is the role of Mullah Akhtar Mansour. Mullah Akhtar Mansour is a member of the Taliban. Mullah Akhtar Mansour is a leader of the Taliban. Then, there is the question of what it means for US relations with Pakistan, which are regarded as crucial to the effort to fight global terrorism. The drone attack suggests the US has lost patience with the Pakistani authorities, which have failed to bring the Taliban to the table, while allegedly harbouring the movement's leaders. So the killing of Mullah Mansour may actually set back the efforts to negotiate a peace settlement. On Monday, the US ambassador was summoned to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry to be harangued about what it described as a \"violation of Pakistan's sovereignty\". The official Pakistani line is that the attack will be an obstacle to future talks. The third question is the one most likely to affect those outside the region: the impact on the drugs trade. It would be tempting to conclude that removing Mansour will make the battle to eradicate opium more straightforward. Mansour helped oversee the transformation of the Taliban from a movement of pious fanatics, largely funded by true believers from abroad, into something very different. After the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, remittances from the Gulf fell away. The Taliban needed new sources of finance. Mullah Mansour is thought to have developed a huge new source of income for the Taliban - along the way enriching himself and his fellow tribesmen. The movement he officially took over last year had been refashioned into what is, in effect, a multi-billion dollar drugs cartel. Afghanistan has now completely eclipsed the former hub of world opium production, the so-called Golden Triangle between Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. But whether the death of Mansour will reduce Afghanistan's opium production is a moot point. Helmand is a Taliban stronghold and traditionally accounts for around half of Afghan opium output. A senior official admitted to the BBC that the intense conflict in the province meant there had been virtually no eradication effort at all this season. Nevertheless, there is evidence that some farmers are moving away from poppy and back to less profitable food crops. One reason may be the effects of a mysterious blight that badly affected last year's poppy harvest. Take a look at the changing patterns of cultivation in these desert areas of Helmand. These images are taken from a forthcoming AREU Watching Brief: Moving with the times: How opium poppy cultivation had adapted to the changing environment in Afghanistan. At the same time, there is considerable evidence that poppy production has increased in areas that are - nominally at least - controlled by the government. Last week, I visited an agricultural community just half an hour away from Mazar-e-Sharif in the north of Afghanistan. The city is, by Afghan standards, a model of good governance and has never been a stronghold of the Taliban, yet I found poppy being grown openly. Conversations with locals suggest that poppy production is not just tolerated, but is actively supported and protected by local police and government officials in return for kickbacks. \"Of course the authorities know we are growing poppies,\" a farmer called Taza Meer told me. \"They can see we are growing it, but they've got to keep quiet about it. The economy here is weak, people have no money. \"The authorities know poppy is the only way people here can make decent money, and they know that people would be very angry if they stopped them.\" He said if the government came in and destroyed his crop or that of other farmers, they would \"take to the mountains\". \"The people will take up arms,\" he told me. \"They'll have no choice but to rebel and there will be chaos here.\" Experts on opium cultivation say this is a pattern repeated across the country. They say opium cultivation is a sign of the weakness of the government. It occurs when local authorities have no choice but to come to an accommodation with farmers. On that basis, there has been a steady deterioration of central authority, as this chart illustrates. It is striking that more opium was produced in 2014, the last year of the Nato combat mission, than in any other year since the UN started keeping records in 2002. Mansour may be dead - but, in the absence of other successful businesses, the opium trade has become an increasingly important enterprise in areas the government controls as well as Taliban-controlled areas. What that suggests is that, whoever is leader of the Taliban, Afghanistan is likely to continue to be the world centre of opium production. Indeed, this year, Afghanistan is expected to produce more opium - and therefore heroin - than the world consumes. It isn't hard to work out what that means: more and cheaper heroin coming to a street near you.",

My favourite song is The Ark from City to City with Jerry Donahue on guitar. He wrote about life itself, things one can relate to. He brought musical quality into life at times when there was not much around. Keith Dhan-Weller, Nuertingen, Germany. Baker Street is probably my favourite song. I'm a songwriter and I teach creative writing. Baker Street is about Gerry's own experience with the music industry but he wrote the lyric in the third person. This makes the story more interesting and sad. The song works on so many different levels. Musically and lyrically. Richard Abbott, Limavady, Northern Ireland.

        "document": "The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it has followed the US too blindly, as in the invasion of Iraq, against the warnings of many in Europe. The UK has experienced foreign policy disasters. The UK has ignored America in some cases. The UK has joined France in invading Suez. The UK has invaded Iraq. Many in Europe have warned the UK against invading Iraq. Britain has done better when it has played its traditional role as a bridge between the two continents: seeking to manage America's swings between isolationism and interventionism while at the same time reassuring Europe that the US could be more than just a brash Nato ally. This Atlanticist analysis is, of course, a simplification of a complex relationship, but the point stands: the UK has a unique opportunity by virtue of its history and geography to bring the US and Europe together, not take sides. And yet the election of Donald Trump risks doing just that, driving a wedge between Britain and the EU just when both sides need it least. Since the president-elect's shock election, the British government has staggered, recovered its balance and started making overtures to the emerging administration. Its public statements have been welcoming and warm. Here is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's latest description of the president-elect, in a Czech newspaper: \"Donald Trump is dealmaker, he is a guy who believes firmly in values that I believe in too - freedom and democracy. As far as I understand, he is in many aspects a liberal guy from New York.\" This is a long way from the criticisms that he and Prime Minister Theresa May uttered during the campaign. But both are now eating their words without shame, for they believe that it is in the national interest for the government to engage with next president of the United States, whatever his character, temperament and policy agenda. The prime minister's Guildhall speech - arguing that everyone should benefit from globalisation - may have been designed to show British voters that she has an agenda for change. But it also sent a strong signal to Mr Trump that she understood the forces that led to his election and the shared need for the whole world to address them. In contrast, some EU countries have worn their hearts on their sleeve and expressed their dissatisfaction at the election of a man whose opinions they find distasteful. This was the context of the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers this week, which Boris Johnson dismissed as a \"whinge-o-rama\". Some British diplomats saw the meeting as an attempt by the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to grandstand and use Mr Trump's election to drive forward her own agenda for more EU defence cooperation. She was distinctly sarcastic about Mr Johnson's refusal to attend the meeting, saying it was \"normal\" for a country that had decided to leave the EU not to be interested in its relations with the US. As if that were not enough, Mr Johnson also clashed with his EU counterparts over Turkey, urging them not to lecture Ankara over the death penalty. And some EU leaders will not like Mrs May acknowledging the strength of Mr Trump's anti-globalisation arguments just as they prepare to do electoral battle with populist parties flying the same anti-establishment flag. So on the face of it, Britain is falling out with Europe over Mr Trump just when its overwhelming foreign policy objective should be preparing the way for Brexit, working closely with European allies to find the areas of common ground where a potential deal could be done. This should be a time for cool diplomacy, not hot-headed spats over who is going to which meeting. And all this before the tough decisions come. Responding to an election is one thing. It is quite another to choose sides when there are real policy dilemmas on the table. What happens if Mr Trump makes overtures to Russia and calls for sanctions over Ukraine to be reduced? What happens if Mr Trump ends US support for Syrian rebels and orders the US military to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State group? This was the one issue of substance Messrs Trump and Putin discussed in their telephone call this week. And what happens if Mr Trump is true to his word and reduces the US commitment to Nato? All of these are policy choices that could see the UK not only reverse longstanding positions but also place itself at odds with either the US or the EU. This is the context for Mrs May's trip to Berlin on Friday where she will meet President Obama and four of her most important European counterparts, from Germany, France , Italy and Spain. The challenge for this untested, newly appointed prime minister will be to walk that traditional fine line between the US and Europe. She has to prepare the way for these tough policy decisions, urging Europe to engage with a president-elect who cannot be ignored. But equally she will be under some pressure to make it clear to the travelling Americans that Britain will not roll over and accept automatically whatever foreign policy emerges from a Trump-led Washington. The UK-US relationship is hardly special at the moment. The UK-US relationship is not special. The UK-US relationship is difficult at the moment. Mr Trump has shown no hesitation at embarrassing Mrs May by giving Nigel Farage a photo-opportunity at Trump Towers, giving the impression that the UKIP leader is filling a vacuum left by the Foreign Office. Mr Obama has chosen to visit Greece and Germany and not the UK on a valedictory European tour and in a news conference described Chancellor Merkel as \"probably... my closest international partner these eight years\". In vain did David Cameron flip those burgers in the Downing Street garden with the president. As the one time US Secretary of State Dean Acheson once wrote: \"Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America... but unique did not mean affectionate.\" So the task now for the British government is to engage with Mr Trump's incipient administration and do what it can - if anything - to shape and influence his foreign policy before firm positions are established. Officials recognise there is a window of opportunity in the coming weeks that should not be wasted that could set the terms for discussions about trade and security. Mrs May is pushing for an early meeting with Mr Trump before the inauguration in January. The Foreign Office is already holding talks with the Trump team about the possibility of Mr Johnson travelling to Washington to meet the Vice-President-elect, Mike Pence, and potentially others in the Trump team in the next few weeks. Officials insist that these discussions began before Mr Farage began claiming his ambassadorial role with Mr Trump. But at the same time, the government also has to ensure that this process of engagement with the US does not make Brexit harder by losing what little political support it still has in Europe's chancelleries. The former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV this week that Britain's focus should be on Europe. \"For the first time really, the most important decisions over the next few years are going to be about our relationship with Europe, not about our relationship with the United States,\" he said. In the past few months, the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump have overturned many of Britain's traditional foreign policy assumptions. The government needs to repair relations with both the US and the EU while not antagonising both in process. Falling between the two geopolitical stools would leave the UK floundering mid-Atlantic without a paddle.",

        "document": "\"I am seriously considering emigrating to Australia, Jamaica or the US,\" says Faye Jones. The 32-year-old PA from Wokingham jumps every time there's a knock at the door and tiptoes around neighbours who might call the police. Five years ago, Faye was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and after suffering from the side effects of prescribed drugs, she now uses cannabis to ease her pain, nausea and inflammation. In the UK, where cannabis is a Class B drug, police can issue warnings or on-the-spot fines for possession of a small amount, while courts can impose sentences of up to five years for possession of larger amounts and up to 14 years for those who supply or produce it. Faye - a campaigner for United Patients Alliance (UPA), which is calling for cannabis to be legally accessed by patients - has a raft of places she could start a new life. Medicinal cannabis is legal - or being legalised - in 25 US states, and in countries from Canada to Italy. \"But I'd rather not leave the country I was born in,\" she says. \"Mum would be devastated.\" Perhaps now she won't have to. A group of MPs has called on the government to legalise medical cannabis after publishing the results of a seven-month inquiry into medicinal use of the drug. A group of MPs has called on the government. The group of MPs has published the results of a seven-month inquiry. The inquiry was into medicinal use of the drug. The drug is medical cannabis. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Drug Policy Reform took evidence from 623 patients, professionals and experts and more than 20,000 scientific and medical reports were reviewed. \"The results are clear. Cannabis has a medical benefit for a wide range of conditions,\" says Mike Barnes, a professor of neurological rehabilitation. However, the NHS warns that cannabis use carries a number of risks, such as impairing the ability to drive, as well as causing harm to lungs if smoked and harm to mental health, fertility or unborn babies. It can also have other serious consequences, with users potentially vulnerable to developing psychotic illnesses, the Royal College of Psychiatrists says. A Home Office spokesman said the government had no plan to legalise cannabis, adding: \"There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health.\" Yet the End Our Pain campaign, which supports the legalisation of medical cannabis, estimates that one million people across the UK rely on the drug for medical reasons. The End Our Pain campaign supports the legalisation of medical cannabis. The End Our Pain campaign estimates that one million people across the UK rely on the drug for medical reasons. By Michelle Roberts, health editor, BBC News online. After weighing the evidence, experts say there is a clear therapeutic role for medical cannabis. There is good evidence that it helps alleviate the symptoms of chronic pain, MS and nausea associated with chemotherapy, as well as anxiety. But for treating other conditions, such as depression, headaches and epilepsy, there is limited or no convincing evidence that it works. There is limited or no convincing evidence for treating other conditions. The other conditions are depression, headaches and epilepsy. Like any drug, cannabis can cause side effects. Smoking cannabis in a joint rolled with tobacco can make asthma worse and probably increases the risk of lung cancer. Regular cannabis use puts some people at increased risk of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, and can also reduce fertility. Cannabis is addictive and you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as cravings, difficulty sleeping, sweating and shaking. Cannabis affects how the brain works. It can make users feel very anxious and even paranoid, it can make it difficult to concentrate and learn. 37. average age of patient. try conventional medicines first. 37% don't tell their doctor. 72% buy street cannabis. 20% grow their own. The United Patients Alliance says 30% of cannabis patients surveyed by the APPG cited depression as a reason for self-medication - though patients reported multiple conditions and depression often accompanies other primary conditions. About a quarter of patients said they used the drug to combat anxiety and a quarter mentioned pain. Almost 70% of the patients surveyed said they had tried conventional medicines first, before turning to cannabis. Doctors told Faye she would have to take low dosages of cancer drugs for the rest of her life to deal with her rheumatoid arthritis. But after suffering hair loss, frequent sickness and \"brain fog\", her job became untenable and her boss took her aside. \"I'd just bought a house and had a mortgage - I couldn't afford to lose my job,\" she says. Inspired by MS patients, she tried cannabis and now spends about £250 a month making her own capsules and creams, mixing cannabis oil and coconut oil. Faye says she takes the pills \"like I would ibuprofen, when I need them\", claiming that the low dosage is not enough to make her high. Along with 38% of users surveyed by the APPG, she also uses a vaporiser to consume the drug. Fewer than a third smoke it with tobacco; one in five smokes it without tobacco. Others eat it, take capsules or use creams. MS patient Penny Fitzlyon, from London, said she was prescribed a variety of opiates which \"switched off all interest in the outside world\". She said they left her \"feeling grotty and miserable\", took away her sense of humour and made her constipated. \"Then after a second MRI scan, I overheard a nurse saying it wouldn't be long before I'd be in a wheelchair,\" she says. \"So I started doing my own research. Cannabis was the only thing I could find that hadn't killed anyone.\" Penny, 52, says she tracked down a herbalist who, unlike street sellers, knew how to mix different strains of cannabis for different patients. \"We want to get rid of street dealers,\" she says. \"Backstreet cannabis is not good - they mix it with sand or glass to make it look all sparkly and heavy.\" Some 72% of cannabis bought for medicinal use is purchased on the street or from friends, but 20% of users grow their own, in groups or by themselves. The remainder is sourced on the internet or abroad, according to those surveyed by the APPG. Penny, who has been cautioned by the police twice, estimates that she spends £5,000 a year on cannabis - a fraction of the £30,000 annual cost of MS prescription drugs, she says. Though she avoids \"getting stoned\", without small doses of the drug Penny finds simple tasks such as walking to the shops \"incredibly painful\". For Jon Liebling, from Reading, brushes with the law have only made him more determined to fight for the right to use cannabis as a medicine. A traumatic childhood, with a mother who attempted suicide and an absent father, left Jon anxious, depressed and struggling to concentrate at school. But after trying cannabis at university, he didn't look back. \"I knew it was illegal\", he says, \"But it just worked. All the pain and stress I'd carried in my back, shoulders and neck for years just went.\" But the 48-year-old's use of cannabis would see him arrested by the police three times - forcing him to leave university, drop out of a nurses' training course and finally land him in court for growing his own. Though the arrests led to no more than a slap on the wrist and a fine, he said they left him feeling \"angry and disenfranchised\". \"My life has been ruined by the law,\" he says. Now, as political director of the UPA, Jon says the conclusions of the parliamentary group are \"incredibly exciting\". \"I don't think judges really want to put people away for it,\" he says. \"I was really honest with the judge about my medical history and he was really sympathetic.\" Though Faye fears the police \"taking away her medicine\" or indeed sending her to prison, she says most people are \"very understanding\" - even potential employers. She says she has mentioned her End Our Pain campaigning in numerous job interviews \"and it never stopped me getting a second interview\". \"I'm cannabis proud,\" she says.",

        "document": "They said the Chinese authorities had never before reported this to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites). However, during the convention's standing committee meeting in Geneva, China reportedly said that it still banned tiger bones. \"A Chinese delegate said, 'we don't ban trade in tiger skins but we do ban trade in tiger bones,'\" a participant in the meeting said. Cites secretariat sources confirmed that a member of the Chinese delegation had said this. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told the BBC Chinese Service he could not verify the reported admission, but he said that China will \"investigate and combat\" any illegal trade in tiger skins. Between 5,000 and 6,000 tigers are believed to be in captivity in China. Wildlife conservation organisations have long demanded an end to the trade in skins. Wildlife experts believe \"tiger farming\" in China has fuelled demand for the poaching and trafficking of the endangered species elsewhere. They say the admission at the meeting will increase pressure on China to curb the practice. Reports also say that the facilities where the captive tigers are held have been providing live animals and parts for illegal international trade. According to officials and participants at the Cites meeting, the admission from China followed the presentation of a report which gave details of how the Chinese government had allowed commercial trade in skins from captive tigers. A Cites meeting took place. Officials and participants were present at the meeting. China admitted to allowing commercial trade in skins from captive tigers. A report was presented at the meeting. The report gave details of China's actions regarding captive tigers. \"The report presented in the meeting created a situation that required China to respond,\" said a participant who did not wish to be named. \"Basically when the meeting focused on the findings of this report, the Chinese delegate intervened,\" he said. \"It was the first time they admitted officially that this trade exists in China.\" The speaker is referring to an official admission. The official admission is about a trade in China. Participants say this created quite a sensation during the Cites meeting. \"After the Chinese intervention... we too intervened and made it clear that the investigations we have done with other organisations clearly show that the trade in China is happening on a commercial scale,\" said Shruti Suresh, a wildlife campaigner with the UK-based Environment Investigation Agency, which has investigated the illegal wildlife trade across the globe. \"The clarification was necessary because the Chinese delegate did not say that it was happening on a commercial scale, and there was a risk that the trade could later be misreported as something done for scientific research or, say, displays in the museums.\" Member countries of the Cites are required to report on what progress they have made to ensure that trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. A new report on illegal wildlife trade suggests that around 1,600 tigers, both from captivity and the wild, have been traded globally since 2000. While China has been a major market for tiger parts, wildlife experts say other South East Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Lao, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia are also emerging as consumers, where tiger farming is growing. Reports say that in the past two years, there have been seizures of nearly 90 tigers likely to have been sourced from, or trafficked through, captive facilities across South East Asia and China. \"Demand-reduction efforts and enforcement and anti-trafficking activities are undermined both by the existence of facilities that keep and breed tigers for commercial purposes, and the lack of enforcement to stop trade from or through them,\" says a report by Species Survival Network (SSN), whose members include more than 100 wildlife conservation organisations. \"Trade in these specimens perpetuated the desirability of tiger parts and China's experiment in licensing the domestic trade in skins of captive tigers has done nothing to alleviate pressure on wild tigers, as evidenced through continued poaching in the wild.\" A little more than 3,000 tigers are believed to be left in the wild across the globe. More than half of those are in India, where 42 tigers were killed last year. \"If the Chinese government has admitted the trade in tiger skins, I think it is a forward step toward curbing illegal trade in tiger parts,\" said SP Yadav, deputy inspector general of India's National Tiger Conservation Authority. \"Denial mode does not help solve the problem but once you accept what is happening, it's easy to move ahead.\" The SSN report says the skins of tigers, leopards and snow leopards are valued among the political, military and business elite as luxury home decorations in China. \"The outcome of recent corruption cases in China confirm they are 'gifted' as non-financial bribes to officials,\" the report says. In 2005, China had announced that it was considering re-opening the domestic trade in tiger bone from tiger breeding facilities. China considered re-opening the domestic trade in tiger bone.

Since the fall of the US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, Cuba has been a one-party state led by Mr Castro and - since February 2008 - by his chosen successor and younger brother, Raul. Fidel Castro exercised control over virtually all aspects of Cuban life through the Communist Party and its affiliated mass organisations, the government bureaucracy and the state security apparatus. Exploiting the Cold War, Fidel Castro was for decades able to rely on strong Soviet backing, including annual subsidies worth $4-5 billion, and succeed in building reputable health and education systems. But, at least partly because of the US trade sanctions, he failed to diversify the economy. The US and Cuba agreed in 2014 to normalise relations. Population 11.2 million. Area 110,860 sq km (42,803 sq miles) Major language Spanish. Major religion Christianity. Life expectancy 77 years (men), 81 years (women) Currency Cuban peso. Raul Castro, the world's longest-serving defence minister, took over as president in February 2008, succeeding his ailing brother Fidel, who had been in power for five decades. After being re-elected by the single-party National Assembly in February 2013, Raul announced his intention to stand down at the end of his second term in 2018. Fidel Castro brought revolution to Cuba in the 1950s and created the western hemisphere's first Communist state. Fidel Castro brought revolution to Cuba. Fidel Castro did so in the 1950s. Fidel Castro created the western hemisphere's first Communist state. His beard, long speeches, cigar, army fatigues and defiance of the United States earned him iconic status across the globe. Raul, 76 at the time of this appointment, has been his brother's trusted right-hand man and was once known as an iron-fisted ideologue who executed Fidel Castro's orders - and enemies - ruthlessly. Under his leadership, Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces became one of the most formidable fighting forces in the Third World with combat experience in Africa, where they defeated South Africa's army in Angola in 1987. The Cuban media are tightly controlled by the government and journalists must operate within the confines of laws against anti-government propaganda and the insulting of officials which carry penalties of up to three years in prison. Reporters without Borders in early 2016 described Cuba as \"one of the world's worst countries from the viewpoint of journalistsâ€¦ independent journalists and bloggers are constantly persecuted by the Castro government\". Some key dates in Cuba's history:. 1898 - Cuba is ceded to the US which defeated Spain in war. 1902 - Cuba becomes independent under the protection of the US. 1933 - Sergeant Fulgencio Batista seizes power in a coup. 1959 - Fidel Castro leads a guerrilla army into Havana, forcing Batista to flee. 1961 - US breaks off diplomatic relations in response to the nationalization of US-owned properties, and later imposes a complete commercial embargo. 1961 - Cuban exiles backed by the US try to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, but are defeated. 1962 - The US and the Soviet Union have a showdown that almost touches off war after the US discovers Soviet nuclear missiles on Cuba. The confrontation ends with the Soviets removing the missiles and the US agreeing never to invade Cuba. 1975 - Castro sends troops to Angola to help fight rebels backed by South Africa. It is the start of 15 years of war in which 300,000 Cubans will fight. 1991 - The Soviet Union, Cuba's biggest benefactor, collapses, touching off an economic crisis. 2006 - Fidel Castro provisionally turns over power to brother Raul Castro, who becomes president in 2008.

Batsman Root is to take over from Alastair Cook. Alastair Cook stepped down on Monday. Alastair Cook stepped down after a record 59 Tests. The Yorkshire player had been Test vice-captain to Cook since May 2015. \"Root is fairly quiet but he has got that fire in his belly. He's a really impressive young man,\" Anderson told The Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show. Should he be named captain aged 26, Root would be a year younger than Cook was when he took on the Test role on a full-time basis in August 2012. No batsman has scored more Test runs than Root's 4,594 since he made his debut on 13 December 2012, and only India captain Virat Kohli (8,536) has scored more runs than Root's 8,469 in all three forms of international cricket. Anderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, has played under five full-time Test captains since making his debut in May 2003. The 34-year-old has served Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Strauss and Cook, as well as Andrew Flintoff who deputised for several Tests in 2006 and 2007. \"Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak and he's a really impressive young man,\" explained Anderson. \"He's the obvious candidate. He is the obvious candidate. The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. While they do not play another Test until July, England then play seven home Test matches - against South Africa and West Indies - in three months, before travelling to Australia in November for the Ashes. Root scored 1,477 Test runs in 2016, making centuries against South Africa, Pakistan and India, as well as scoring 796 runs in one-day internationals and 297 in Twenty20 internationals. \"He loves cricket. It's very rare you see a player that's had the success he's had and he's not like that,\" Anderson said. \"In the brief period Alastair Cook's been off the field -  for bathroom breaks -  Root's been in there making changes. He's been good. \"It can be a difficult situation for a vice-captain when the captain goes off, you're in charge and myself and Stuart [Broad] might not make it that easy to go up and talk tactics. However he's done that and he's been good.\" Root has led Yorkshire four times in the County Championship, taking charge when the county secured the 2014 County Championship title after then-captain Andrew Gale was suspended. He was also the on-field captain when Middlesex, led by Australian batsman Chris Rogers, made a record 472-3 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in the same year. All-rounder Ben Stokes, who was vice-captain on the recent limited-overs tour of Bangladesh which regular ODI skipper Eoin Morgan missed, was described as a \"natural leader\" by his Durham skipper Paul Collingwood. \"Ben has got a natural draw to him and he would be an excellent vice-captain for Root,\" former England limited-overs captain Collingwood said on the Tuffers and Vaughan show. \"The captain will have leaders underneath him that he knows he can go to - I think Ben Stokes would be the perfect man for that.\" Fast bowler Stuart Broad has also been mooted - he captained the Twenty20 side between 2011 and 2014 - and Anderson said: \"I wouldn't be against a fast bowler but one issue could be fitness. \"Bowlers get injured a lot more so are they going to play every game? The international schedule is hectic so it can be difficult.\" Wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, who led the one-day side in Bangladesh in Morgan's absence and remains the official limited-overs vice-captain, has also been suggested as a possible candidate. However, the Lancashire player's Test place is not guaranteed given current keeper Jonny Bairstow's good form - although Buttler played as a specialist batsman in the last three Tests of the recent India series. Ex-England spinner Graeme Swann told BBC Radio 5 live he felt the pressure of potential Test captaincy was already affecting Root's batting. \"I think we should leave Joe Root to be the best batsman this country has ever produced, which he would be without the burden of being the captain,\" he said. However, Kohli, along with Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, have each raised their games since becoming captains of their respective countries. Smith and Kohli are the two top-ranked Test batsmen, while Williamson is one of 13 men to have scored a Test century against all of the other nine Test-playing nations. \"It's very English to assume the captaincy will affect him. The other three have got captaincy of their country and gone to a different level with it,\" said ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan, who came through the same Sheffield Collegiate club side and Yorkshire academy ranks which produced Root, and has been a long-term mentor to the young right-hander. \"I don't think there's an issue with him captaining, he's too good a player. I think he'd be a good one. You have an opinion about someone. You think the person would be good at something. \"To captain any team you have to be loving the game, love the difficult moments and prove people wrong. He is that kind of character.\" England and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was named captain of the county in December 2016, said that his team-mate Root's inexperience was not an issue in him assuming the captaincy. The pair lived together in 2011 during their early years in the Yorkshire first team and Ballance took Root's place when he was dropped for the final Test of England's Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14. \"I think both of us have probably matured a bit more as cricketers and people. He's ready as a leader now in that England changing room,\" Ballance told BBC World Service's Stumped programme. \"I think Rooty's a natural born leader. He's done it from a young age. People follow him. \"He speaks well, he's got a great cricket brain. I don't think inexperience is too much of a problem. He'll be ready if he gets the opportunity.\"",

The forest reserves are in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The forest reserves could displace as many as 1.3 million people. With funding from Norway, Liberia has proposed 30% of their forests become protected areas by 2020. DR Congo, funded by Germany and the Global Environmental Facility, aims to set aside 12-15% of their forested lands. Consultants TMP Systems concluded:. \"Governments have targets to expand their protected areas, and now with new climate funding being available the risk is they will use this to expand in a way that doesn't respect local rights,\" said Andy White, from the Rights and Resources Initiative, the campaign group that sponsored the research. \"It could result in the displacement of millions of people.\" The statement is about a possible consequence. The consequence could result in the displacement of millions of people. Analysts say that this type of displacement has already happened in sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and Latin America, and sometimes caused violent conflict. \"I don't think the international community wants to displace rural dwellers in Liberia - but I think if we go about it in the way we are talking about it right now, that is going to be the result,\" said Constance Teague, from Liberia's Sustainable Development Institute. \"We need to recognise that indigenous communities respect the forest and they have worked on [it] for hundreds of years. \"It may not look like what the international community may expect, but this effort to conserve the land does exist.\" Liberia had the largest forest space left in West Africa, largely because of the indigenous communities, she added. The report also looks into the costs of compensating people for the loss of their lands in both Liberia and DR Congo, which range from $200m (Â£137m) to more than Â£1bn. The main argument for setting up reserves is to:. And Mr White said: \"We need to make evidence available that makes it clear that the woods are full of people, and it makes more sense to help them rather than kick them out. \"Where indigenous peoples rights are protected, and they are able to use their forests for their own livelihoods, they have more carbon per hectare than protected areas. \"They are active protectors, you don't have to pay a park guard, because they protect their forests, and that is what the world needs.\" Some 1.5 billion indigenous people inhabit or claim most of the land in the world - but, according to a study released last year, they have legal rights to just 10%.

The Act was introduced after the 2010 election to bind together the two parts of the new coalition government. The discretion of prime ministers to pick the timing of elections was removed and the dates fixed five years apart - we are next due one on Thursday 7 May 2020. The Act provides two mechanisms by which an early election could be triggered, which are:. Taking each in turn, the government does not have the numbers on its own to achieve a two-thirds majority so any vote would depend on what the other parties do. Jeremy Corbyn has warned the Labour Party to prepare for an election next year and Newsnight reported in September that he planned to instruct his MPs to vote in favour of an early election if the government wanted to call one (although that has not been confirmed). Latest polls suggest that supporting an early election would be a mistake for Labour. It is unlikely the Scottish National Party would come to the government's assistance in bringing about an early election. The SNP is unlikely to come to the government's assistance. The SNP is unlikely to come to the government's assistance in bringing about an early election. Looking at the second mechanism, if other parties do not support an early election it would be unprecedented in British politics for a government to bring about its own downfall (though such engineering is not unknown elsewhere) and the government voting no confidence in itself could be a risky strategy. More likely is that the Fixed Term Parliaments Act could be repealed or amended, to require, for example, a simple majority of MPs in favour of an early election, though the House of Lords may have something to say about this. An amendment to existing legislation seems more straightforward than trying to reintroduce the prerogative power to call elections. In short, the calling of an early election would require either a change in the law, or some unusual parliamentary gymnastics.",

In its UK Bioenergy Strategy, published in April 2012, the coalition government placed high importance on the role biomass can play, warning that excluding it from the energy mix would \"significantly increase the cost of decarbonising our energy system - an increase estimated by recent analysis at Â£44bn\". However, it added that ministers had a responsibility to ensure that \"policies only supported bioenergy use in the right circumstances\". The strategy document outlined four guiding principles that would underpin policy decisions, one of which stated:. The UK introduced the Climate Change Act 2008, which obliges governments to deliver an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emission from 1990 levels by 2050. Experts agree that in order for this target to be met, the UK's energy infrastructure must drastically cut its carbon footprint. Experts agree on something. The UK's energy infrastructure must drastically cut its carbon footprint. Outdoor laboratory. In a Lincolnshire field, a team of scientists led by researchers from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) carried out a range of experiments on two bioenergy crops: miscanthus grass and short-rotation coppice willow. Natural England's guide to miscanthus (PDF) In their outdoor laboratory, they set out to measure how much atmospheric carbon the crops were able to lock in the soil. \"The big barrier as far as bioenergy crops are concerned is a fear of the unknown in terms of soil carbon losses or gains - this is the gap we are trying to fill,\" explained lead researcher Niall McNamara. \"At this field site, we are very lucky to have two key bioenergy crops growing side-by-side, which is allowing us to make a comparison of their effects on soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from the soil,\" he told BBC News. One of the experiments involves erecting three-metre high tents over a section of the crops, allowing the team to expose the plants to a \"carbon tracer\" - a form of carbon that is different from atmospheric carbon so it is possible for the researchers to track its movements from the surrounding air, through the plants and into the soil. \"This is added through the tent for about four to five hours,\" said Dr McNamara. \"During this time, it is fixed by the plants through photosynthesis. We then follow that carbon which has been fixed by the plant into the soil and into the microbes and back out of the soil.\" He added that the experiment would provide data on how novel crops, such as miscanthus, introduced carbon into the soil and how stable it was once it was in the ground. \"As you can see, miscanthus is very different from anything you would see normally,\" he observed. \"It originates from Asia and so there has not been a lot of work done on it and the carbon tracer approach is a very good way of seeing how much carbon fixed by the plant will stay in the soil a year later.\" Another experiment the team are carrying out involves taking a metre-deep soil sample, which co-researcher Rebecca Rowe describes as \"quite unusual\". \"A lot of soil science, at the moment, is done to about 30cm, partly for practical reasons as coring to a metre is difficult,\" she said. Digging deep. In order to extract the metre-long sample, the team have to enlist the help of \"Kevin\", an adapted road-breaker. \"Also because a lot of arable crops or grassland crops the rooting depths are much shallower, a lot of the changes are happening in the top 30cm,\" Dr Rowe told BBC News. \"Obviously, with energy crops that are in the ground for 20-25 years, we are looking at a lot longer timescale and a greater depth for rooting so it is important for us to go deeper.\" Dr Rowe is 12 months into a three-year project that involves collecting metre soil samples all over the UK. \"We could just do it here at our Lincolnshire site, but then we would only be able to say what is happening with soil carbon in this location in this soil type,\" she explained. \"By going all over the country, we can look at different soil types and different climates - the South-West is very different  to, say, southern Scotland. \"It gives us a much better idea of what the overall effect on soil carbon may be in all of the sites across the UK with growing things like willow, miscanthus and different arable crops as well.\" (Source: UK Bioenergy Strategy) Dr McNamara said the data would be used to develop a model, developed by researchers from Aberdeen University and other partners, to show how growing bioenergy crops would affect an area of land's soil carbon characteristics. \"Our plan is to make a model universally available to the community, so a user could download our model and then - for example - predict what would happen if they converted their land to bioenergy crops in terms of the implication for soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said. The project - commissioned and funded by the Energy Technologies Institute, with additional funding from the Natural Environment Research Council - would, Dr McNamara added, help address the concern over the scarcity of data on bioenergy crops and carbon cycling, and allow policymakers make informed decisions about the role bioenergy can play in delivering a low carbon UK energy mix.",

Juppe v Fillon: Battle of France's conservatives. Press review: France's 'Mr Nobody' Francois Fillon. Fillon under fire over women's rights. The past week has seen a campaign marked by a bitter row over the nature Mr Fillon's social policies. Mr Juppe provoked a furious reaction when he questioned whether Mr Fillon, a Roman Catholic, could seek to challenge the legality of abortion. But polling suggests such tactics seem to have backfired on Mr Juppe, once the favourite seen as the safe choice. A poll of 908 debate viewers by Elabe suggested 71% of conservative respondents found Mr Fillon more convincing, as did 57% of viewers of all political stripes. \"It is true that my project is more radical and perhaps more difficult,\" said Mr Fillon. His controversial economic reforms include cutting half a million public sector jobs and scrapping the 35-hour work week, prompting comparisons to the late British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Mr Juppe also proposes cutting jobs and liberalising work hours, though to a lesser extent. Both propose roughly similar cuts to public spending of at least â‚¬100bn (Â£85bn; $106bn). \"I've got a plan for the reforms I want to make in the first three months of the presidential term - and I'm convinced if we don't get these changes implemented in the first three months, the French people will feel disheartened, they'll turn away from politics, and then there'll be a greater risk of the extremists winning,\" Mr Fillon said. The country was \"on the brink of revolt\", which could only be averted with such radical action. Conservative Le Figaro says the debate \"eased tensions on the right\" and showed the two contenders \"have already formed identical visions and almost similar projects\" - in particular the need to end the \"vicious cycle of spending and debt\". They have \"some differences on security, education and migration, but they are minor\", concludes its political editor. But centre-left Le Monde's political correspondent disagrees, seeing \"significant differences\" on the European Union, Russia and Syria. While Mr Fillon wants to \"respect the sovereignty\" of EU member states, Mr Juppe favours a \"powerful EU as a future world power\". On Syria, Mr Fillon wants to put France \"back in play\" by \"opening a channel to Damascus\", whereas Mr Juppe wants to \"boost transatlantic co-operation\" and takes a firm line against President Bashar al-Assad, Le Monde says. Left-wing Liberation writes that the debate between \"Fillon the radical and Juppe the reconciler\" was \"knotty, often tense, but not aggressive\".

Alun Cairns said this in the context of the election. Significant powers had been handed to Scotland and councils, he added. MPs were debating the UK government's Wales Bill - to transfer further powers from Westminster to Cardiff Bay. MPs were debating. The topic of the debate was the UK government's Wales Bill. The purpose of the Wales Bill was to transfer further powers from Westminster to Cardiff Bay. Earlier another Conservative, Brecon and Radnorshire MP Chris Davies, had told BBC Wales he could \"see my first rebellion against the government will be coming\" over the referendum issue. Asked if other Tory MPs would join him in a rebellion, he said: \"I personally feel there will be.\" Addressing Mr Cairns in the Commons later Mr Davies he said he was \"personally very disappointed that in this clause we have broken a manifesto commitment and I would ask if you, who stood on the same manifesto, are equally as disappointed that you are breaking this commitment?\" Mr Cairns replied: \"First of all it was the 2014 [Government of Wales] Act that devolved tax varying powers to the assembly.

He later confirmed AMs would also be able to make voting in assembly elections compulsory, a power transfer welcomed by Labour Ynys Mon MP Albert Owen as \"radical\" and \"excellent\". Mr Davies wrote a letter to the Chancellor George Osborne with Tory backbench colleagues Byron Davies, David Davies, James Davies and David Jones after his Autumn Statement in November urging him to reverse plans to devolve the tax powers without a referendum. Under existing law AMs can call a referendum on powers to vary income tax, but in 2015 Mr Osborne offered those powers without a referendum. Existing law allows AMs to call a referendum on powers to vary income tax. In 2015, Mr Osborne offered those powers without a referendum. The Wales Bill also makes substantial changes to the way the assembly makes law by defining, for the first time, the areas that are in the hands of Westminster. It also grants new powers for AMs and Welsh ministers, including speed limits, control over fracking, the name of the assembly and elections to the Senedd.

Qualification for the 2014 World Cup may be a step too far, but there are a number of initiatives under way to boost the sport. The challenges are to nurture that growing interest while wooing fans away from watching overseas football on TV,  and the need to create a strong national league and international team. Off the pitch there is the need to build football industry and infrastructure, while boosting the expertise of administrators and coaching and other backroom staff. \"There is a challenge from cricket, which gets the most investment,\" admits Kushal Das, general secretary of the All India Football Federation (AIFF). There is a challenge from cricket. Cricket gets the most investment. Kushal Das admits the challenge from cricket. Kushal Das is the general secretary of the All India Football Federation (AIFF). \"Many youngsters though are now watching a lot of football, mainly European leagues. \"We need to develop interest in the Indian leagues, and we need development programmes for that.\" Mr Das said he was encouraged by the recent visit of Fifa president Sepp Blatter to the country. The country is hoping to host the Under-17 World Cup in 2017, and Mr Blatter has so far offered encouraging noises. Mr Das said that highlights over the past couple of years included India playing in the AFC Asian Cup in 2011 for the first time in more than 20 years, and the 15-year commercial and marketing partnership between the AIFF and IMG-Reliance. Encouragement has also come from a recent development plan for football in India drawn up with Fifa. \"We are starting up academies for player development in four cities by July and another four by July 2013, for different age groups,\" says Mr Das. A technical director has also been appointed for the first time, unusual as it may seem that such a role did not exist before. \"We are looking not just at player development, but also administration, education, referees,\" says Mr Das. \"If we are successful in hosting the Under-17 there will be [business] opportunities, to participate in the whole development of Indian football - it is a great opportunity.\" He adds: \"The biggest challenge is infrastructure. I hope, if we have the World Cup hosting rights, that there will be serious efforts to improve the infrastructure.\" IMG and stadium builders Populous have already been around the country looking at which existing stadiums could potentially be brought up to scratch for 2017.

We also taking to the FA and taking advice from the Indian Premier League cricket, and hockey, about ways to boost the football industry and surrounding football industry skills.\" Pune also has contacts with English Premier League football clubs, including Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers, who both have training academies in the city. \"Other clubs have been to India to just hold training sessions, but Liverpool has shown a clear commitment,\" says Mr Kadam. \"Most European clubs seriously underestimate the Indian market. \"There are organisations in India ready to spend money in partnerships with European clubs.\" One club which has formed a partnership is Italian side Inter Milan, which has entered a joint football venture with Tata Tea to support a youth football tournament in India, covering 15 cities, 1,000 schools, and one million children. Mario de Vivo, Inter Milan chief commercial officer, adds: \"We then select 16 young Indian pupils and take them to Inter Milan training academy for three days. \"We are bringing to India not only technical skills, but also medical, nutritional, and psychological support. \"We are able to offer a complete platform to help young teams, federations, and other people that want to learn about football and improve the professional side.\" Business bodies in India also wants to improve transparency, accountability, marketing, planning and professionalism in football. Rajpal Singh of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) says: \"We realise in sport we need foreign expertise. \"We want to create a sporting culture in India, and bring about attitudinal change and develop a sporting infrastructure. \"India is a cricket country but over the past two years you can see a change in attitude. Sports people are now looking towards football. \"But we need to examine the whole football infrastructure.\" IMG-Reliance is bringing its sports industry expertise to India as part of its deal with the AIFF. \"Indians love football and can play football. If you buy into that premise then you know we will be successful,\" says IMG's Jefferson Slack. Mr Slack admits there are challenges on the football and infrastructure side, but says there is a competitive media market in India that is \"going to need high quality football content\". He adds: \"There are certainly some challenges. The existing league suffers from anâ€¦ organisation standpoint. \"The IPL [cricket] was instructive because it showed that a properly constructed franchise league could work. \"There is a lot of money in India to build a brand.

Jac Larner is from Cardiff University. Jac Larner sums up the night for Wales' five main parties. WELSH LABOUR. Labour have exceeded all expectations in Wales. They have outperformed every single Wales-only poll over the course of the campaign - and the exit poll - achieving their highest share of the vote in Wales since 1997. Not only did they successfully defend their 25 seats, but they gained three seats from the Conservatives, taking their total to 28 in Wales. This is their best performance in terms of seat share since 2005, and their best performance in terms of share of the Wales vote since the New Labour landslide of 1997. This extends their run of winning general elections in Wales to 26 in a row. WELSH CONSERVATIVES. The Conservatives also saw their vote share increase across Wales by 6.3%, but this was not enough for them to hold off Labour's surge in Wales. Early in the night they were confident about gaining seats in Bridgend, Newport West and in the north east of Wales, so a net loss of 3 seats will be a big disappointment. Historically, the Conservatives have always performed worse in Wales than in England at every election going back to 1859, and this election looks to be no different. PLAID CYMRU. It was a strange night for Plaid Cymru that ended in success with the election of their youngest ever MP, Ben Lake. They increased their parliamentary representation, taking Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats, and their vote held up where they were defending the three seats won in 2015. Their group of four MPs is the party's largest Westminster cohort since the 2001 general election. Their group of four MPs is the party's largest Westminster cohort. Yet their vote share fell nationally by 1.7% and they lost votes in their other target seats of Ynys Mon, Llanelli and Rhondda. However, Plaid will view themselves as one of the few winners in this election on a night where smaller parties saw their vote share squeezed across the UK. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. The Liberal Democrats' torrid time at elections in Wales continues. They won their worst ever share of the vote in the party's history in Wales, and lost their solo MP Mark Williams in Ceredigion to Plaid Cymru. With only one AM in Wales, and limited representation in local government in Wales, the Liberal Democrats can no longer be considered to be a significant political player in the country. It is the first time since the founding of one of the Lib Dem's predecessor party, the Liberals, in 1859 that they will have no Westminster representation in Wales. UKIP's vote share has collapsed considerably across Wales, polling 11.6% less than 2015 after 38 constituencies had been called. Opinion polling across the campaign suggested that around two-thirds of the 2015 UKIP vote would go to the Conservatives. From the results we have seen so far, it seems that a significant proportion of these voters have voted for Labour in Wales.",

        "document": "It is a talent that helped him move from being bankrupt, aged 32, to becoming a multimillionaire by the time he was 48. Along the way he created and sold best-selling upmarket crisps brand Tyrrells, and won a high-profile battle against supermarket giant Tesco. Now 56, and the founder and owner of Chase Vodka, a luxury version of the spirit made from potatoes grown on his farm, the serial entrepreneur says: \"People love stories, the real stories behind things. \"And the media was very important to me from the first days of Tyrrells. \"I was a guy who had been beaten up by the supermarkets, and people love to support the underdog.\" The son of potato farmers who lived near the Herefordshire town of Leominster, Mr Chase bought the family farm from his dad when he was 20 after he \"managed to find a bank manager brave enough to lend me £200,000\". As the cost of potatoes can rise and fall sharply, business was up and down for the next 12 years, until torrential rain in 1992 meant he couldn't harvest his crop, which he had to leave to rot in the fields. Overextended financially, the business collapsed, and Mr Chase had to file for bankruptcy. He says: \"I was very ashamed and embarrassed.\" He says: \"I was very ashamed and embarrassed.\" He expresses a negative emotion. After \"running away to Australia\" for a few months, he returned to Herefordshire, and was able to borrow funds to buy back the farm from the receivers, and start up in business again. This time, to make extra money, he became a potato trader, buying spuds from a number of farms, and then selling them on to supermarkets. Yet while he got himself back on his feet financially, Mr Chase says he became increasingly frustrated that supermarkets would reject potatoes that weren't \"cosmetically perfect\". He adds: \"I'd send off 10 loads of spuds every day, and I'd be getting five back. It was very painful how the supermarkets were treating us farmers.\" Mr Chase's life-changing moment came in 2002 when he found out that rejected potatoes were being bought up by the UK operation of US crisp-maker Kettle. At the time Kettle was one of new companies making so-called \"posh crisps\", potato crisps which were cut a little thicker than the mass-market brands, and fried by hand. Despite having no crisp-making experience or knowledge, Mr Chase was convinced he could set up his own upmarket crisps brand. So he phoned a few UK crisp-makers to ask if he could see how they did things, and all said \"no\". Undeterred, he flew out to the US and visited facilities in Pennsylvania and Colorado. Returning to the UK, he built a crisp-making facility at the family farm, and Tyrrells [taking its name from the property] was up and running six months later. Quick to tell his story to local newspapers to build up publicity, Mr Chase hit the road to spend two weeks visiting independent food shops across the UK with samples of his crisps. He says: \"Tyrrells grew and grew very quickly, and it was a brilliant cash cow. We'd sell the bags to shops for £1 and they would retail them for £2. For us the net profit was 35%.\" Supermarkets such as Waitrose soon followed suit, but Mr Chase was adamant that he would not sell to the largest - Tesco - because he didn't like what he saw as the pressure it put on farmers to lower their prices. Then one day in 2006 a friend told him that Tesco was selling Tyrrells' crisps. It transpired that Tesco had been buying them on the grey market, and selling them below the recommended retail price. An incensed Mr Chase demanded that Tesco stop selling them. After the supermarket refused, Mr Chase started a media campaign that included an appearance on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Tesco then did back down. With sales of Tyrrells crisps continuing to grow over the next few years, and annual turnover hitting £14m, Mr Chase borrowed money from his bank to expand production. The condition the bank set was that he had to bring in a management team to help him run the business. Mr Chase, who had previously been very hands on, and liked to help out with all parts of the business, says that bringing in new managers ultimately changed the business - to its detriment. \"We got to a stage where I didn't like where the business was going,\" he says. \"We were employing corporate people who were arranging meetings about more meetings.\" Unhappy with Tyrrells' new big business ethos, and going through a \"messy divorce\", Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder - decided to sell up in 2008 to a private capital business for almost £40m. Looking for a new business venture, and with the new owners of Tyrrells choosing to buy their potatoes from elsewhere, Mr Chase came up with the idea of turning his spuds into premium vodka. So with money no longer a problem, he bought a distillation system, and Chase Vodka was born. Aimed at the luxury end of the market, it retails for £35 a bottle. While Mr Chase admits it isn't anywhere near as profitable as selling crisps, it appears to be very much a labour of love. And focused very much on exports, he spends a lot of time travelling the world to build up sales. And showing that he has lost little of his public relations skills, every year he flies influential barmen and women from around the world to visit his farm in Herefordshire to see how the potatoes are grown, and vodka is made. Also now making a gin and a whisky, the Chase Distillery sells 10,000 bottles a week. The Chase Distillery makes gin and whisky. The Chase Distillery sells 10,000 bottles a week.

        "document": "New analysis for BBC News shows that many people relying on their savings income are worse off than ever before. Savings rates plummeted after the Bank of England slashed its base rate in the financial crisis. Since last autumn, as the economic outlook has worsened, they have fallen again. Tax-free Isas, fixed rate bonds and easy access accounts are all at or near their lowest points. In research carried out for the BBC, the rate-checking firm Savings Champion recorded 1,440 savings rate cuts last year and more than 230 so far this year. Savings Champion is a rate-checking firm. Savings Champion recorded 1,440 savings rate cuts last year. Savings Champion recorded more than 230 savings rate cuts so far this year. While low interest rates are welcomed by mortgage borrowers, they strike fear into those at or near retirement who had hoped that income from their nest eggs would help pay the bills. \"There's no light at the end of the tunnel,\" says 76-year-old Mick Bridge, one of a group of ramblers from Chesterfield who all depend on savings. \"Like most retired people, there was a plan and suddenly it's not like it was anymore. The pot's disappearing.\" Fellow walker Sharon Beresford is worried that low interest rates will leave more older people needing help to pay for care. \"It's helping young people buy houses, but it's not helping me,\" she says, \"There are a lot of us to be looked after.\" The fall in rates has come across the board, with significant reductions from National Savings & Investments, Bank of Scotland, NatWest and Nationwide Building Society. The average return from the five best easy access accounts has dropped from more than 3% in 2012 to under 1.3%. Tax-free Isa rates are at their lowest ever. The average variable rate Isa is down to 1%, while a typical fixed-rate Isa pays 1.4%. Another Chesterfield rambler, 63-year-old Judith Knowles, started dipping into her savings when she discovered she would have to wait for her state pension because women's pension ages were being raised. Low savings rates have forced her to dip in again. Low savings rates have affected her. Low savings rates have forced her to dip in again. \"It's worrying,\" she says. \"I've had letters saying the rates are going down even more.\" Some rates of return are so tiny that savers can improve their situation by switching to a better offer. First Direct pays just 0.05% to customers in its Savings Account, while Santander has an Easy Isa with an interest rate of a mere 0.1%. Anna Bowes, director of Savings Champion, traces the problem back to a decision by the previous Coalition government to supply banks with cheap money to boost their lending. \"The competition between providers has been sucked out of the market,\" she explains, \"They just don't need to raise money from savers any more, which has had a devastating impact.\" A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: \"These have been frustrating times for savers. The Bank of England's base rate has remained at a record low for several years. \"While this has been good news for borrowers, it has fostered a low-interest-rate environment which has not been easy for many savers to bear.\" The looming EU referendum has confused the outlook for savers, with George Osborne warning borrowers that a vote to leave could lead to higher interest rates and others speculating that uncertainty could prompt the Bank of England to cut its base rate again. Behind the scenes, senior bankers warn that very low savings rates are likely to be the \"new normal\", given the precarious economic situation across the world.",

Two staff members of Marine Le Pen were detained. The detention was part of a financial inquiry. Marine Le Pen is a far-right candidate. Her chief of staff was placed under formal investigation over the alleged misuse of EU funds to pay parliamentary assistants, French media report. Her bodyguard was also questioned. The National Front (FN) leader, who denies any wrongdoing, dismissed the investigation as a \"political dirty trick\". She enjoys a solid lead in opinion polls for the first round in April but is seen as being easily defeated in the second. Mr Bayrou has run three times for president, winning more than 18% of the vote in the 2007 election. Announcing that he would not stand this year, he offered to join forces with Mr Macron to prevent \"the failure of France\". Ms Le Pen, he said, posed a \"major and immediate threat for our country and Europe\". Welcoming the news, Mr Macron, a free-market liberal, told Reuters news agency: \"The alliance proposed by Francois Bayrou... fully matches our commitment to renewal and unity.\" Analysts say Mr Bayrou's support base is likely to split now between Mr Macron and his conservative opponent Francois Fillon. A new opinion poll indicates that Mr Macron and Mr Fillon are neck and neck in the race for the all-important second place in the first round - with both on about 19%. According to the same poll, taken before the alliance was announced, Mr Bayrou would net 5.5% while Ms Le Pen would take 26%. In the second round, Mr Macron would beat Ms Le Pen by 61% to 39%, while Mr Fillon would also defeat the far-right candidate, but by 57% to 43%. Early on in the campaign, Mr Fillon was viewed as the clear favourite to reach the run-off along with Ms Le Pen and win, but a scandal over payments to his family dented his image in January. He had talks with his fellow conservative former prime minister Alain Juppe, whom he beat in the Republican party primaries, on Wednesday, Le Figaro newspaper reports. He had talks with Alain Juppe.

Ms Le Pen has been accused by the European Parliament of misusing a total of some 340,000 euros (£289,000; $359,000), AFP news agency reports. It is alleged that she claimed a salary for her bodyguard Thierry Legier for a bogus job and paid her chief of staff, Catherine Griset, as her EU assistant in Brussels when Ms Griset was actually working for the party. Mr Legier and Ms Griset were taken in for questioning on Wednesday. \"The French can tell the difference between genuine scandals and political dirty tricks,\" Ms Le Pen responded, drawing a distinction between her case and that of Mr Fillon. This election promises to one of the most dramatic in decades in France, a core member of the EU with the world's sixth-largest economy. Fillon apologises over family payments. Le Pen refuses to repay 'misused EU cash'",

But rising cotton and wool prices mean it is unlikely that uniform prices can fall any further, Neil Saunders, of Verdict Research, said.

The generic school uniform items are the constituent parts of a generic school uniform. The generic school uniform items are sold for less than £5 each. The generic school uniform items are sold by Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, as well as Marks and Spencer. For example, Asda is selling a white shirt for £1, Sainsbury's has put a £2 price tag on grey and black trousers, and Tesco has blue and green sweaters on sale for £1.75. Although labour costs are low as many of these items are manufactured in Bangladesh and China, the margin for these items is still extremely slim. The supermarkets accept this owing to the brand loyalty they gain from customers, who buy uniforms at cheap prices and then stay in the store to buy other goods such as school accessories and groceries. The price war is unusual and prices for many other items are rising. Plus-size school uniforms launch. The picture is also different for parents who must buy uniforms from specialist suppliers. Owing to prescriptive demands of these uniforms, prices tend to be higher than the generic supermarket clothes. Verdict Research estimates the UK school uniform market to be worth £694m.

As long as it lasts a term or half a year, parents are quite satisfied with that.\" He added that because wholesale prices of cotton and wool were rising, it would be difficult to cut prices any further. Last month, Marks and Spencer announced it had started to sell over-sized school uniforms for overweight children as young as four. Campaigners said it was simply commercial recognition of the fact obesity was a growing problem among younger pupils. Marks and Spencer said the trial range followed demand from parents.",

        "document": "It was relief more than real jubilation. The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about expectations. At one point a rumour swept the gathering that he'd lost more than a third of his alliance's seats in the Knesset - in the end the exit polls suggested it would be more like a quarter. Cue wild celebration. If you add together Mr Netanyahu's natural allies among the religious parties and the rest of the right - and assume he'll be able to attract at least one party from the centre or even the left - then he should be able to form a government again. Senior Likud figure Danny Danon was quick to tell me that the only thing that would be remembered from this night was the fact that his boss had won a third term as prime minister. \"There is only one prime minister possible for Israel from these results. And that's Benjamin Netanyahu. \"I say to my friends here on the left that they should not be opening the champagne after these results.\" Any champagne that Mr Netanyahu may be tempted to open will be feeling a little flat though. He emerges from these elections a rather diminished figure, whose wheeling and dealing skills may be sorely tested as he sets about building a new coalition. When he spoke to a crowd of activists in Tel Aviv he was measured, although it took him some time to persuade his supporters to stop celebrating long enough to make himself heard. \"I am going to seek as broad a government as possible\", he said. \" I'm going to seek out many partners.\" That was perhaps his way of acknowledging that the overall results of the night were curiously ambiguous. To the left of Mr Netanyahu, Labour picked up seats but to the right of him so did Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home party) led by his former chief of staff Naftali Bennett. The undoubted star of the evening was Yair Lapid, a famous TV presenter who stepped off the screen to found a new centrist party called Yesh Atid (There is a Future). It has been an extraordinary debut. The party may well emerge as the second largest grouping in the new Knesset and should command a place in a Netanyahu-led coalition. Because Mr Lapid is a political newcomer, it's hard to say what price he might try to extract in return for his support. But you can expect a higher profile for the vexed issue of whether Israel's ultra-Orthodox community ought to be required to perform its share of national service (it's currently exempt). The wider world will examine these results for clues about Israel's future attitude towards peace talks with the Palestinians or the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. The truth of the matter is that it's far too early to make those kind of judgements, which will depend on the balance of forces within a future coalition more than on the outcome of the popular vote. But the sudden and decisive lurch to the right that many predicted hasn't happened. The results show that there's plenty of life on the left and the centre of Israeli politics too. Some political journalists at Likud headquarters were arguing within hours of the exit polls that the results sent such a confused signal about the political mood in Israel that they made another election likely within a year. Having said this is a chastening result for Benjamin Netanyahu it's only fair to record that it's been a thought provoking one for anyone in the business of making political predictions here, too. Mr Netanyahu was supposed to win easily - and he certainly didn't. And the campaign was supposed to have failed to capture the Israeli imagination - and turnout was remarkably high. It's said to take an average of well over a month to form a coalition government after polling day here - and there's no reason to assume that it will be any quicker than the average this time around. The first contacts between party leaders were probably under way before the celebrations at Likud HQ had died away. The first contacts between party leaders happened.

The court was told Hutchinson also had hundreds of other voyeuristic images, including \"up skirt\" pictures taken on the London Underground while he was  volunteering at the 2012 Olympics.

Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year. But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report \"disingenuous\". He said it was \"another example of fudging the facts\". The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union. The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers their impact on overall migration figures. The report is from Migration Watch. Migration Watch advocates tighter immigration controls. The report looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU. The report considers the impact of these policies on overall migration figures. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw. No-one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration. It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place. But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration? Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force? Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere? And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK? These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum. The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: \"It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes.\" Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would \"continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future\", he said. \"Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries,\" he said. \"Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services.\" The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20% of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work. It said: \"This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000.\" The figures should not be taken as a \"precise estimate\" but were \"intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined\", it said. There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded. Those who are \"self-sufficient\" would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs. Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK. Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested. EU citizens living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights. Migration Watch suggested this. However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: \"Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds.

The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had \"ironclad information\" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and \"pushed hard\" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was \"just not true\", but he hoped the resolution would \"serve as a wake-up call\" for Israel.

The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\". Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister.

Mr Pistorius made history in London last year when he became the first double-amputee track athlete to compete in the Olympic Games. By Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Johannesburg. There is widespread shock and disbelief in South Africa after athlete Oscar Pistorius was arrested over the killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Oscar Pistorius was arrested. Oscar Pistorius was arrested over the killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. There is shock and disbelief in South Africa. Reeva Steenkamp was killed by Oscar Pistorius. There has been an outpouring of grief for the model, along with many messages of support for the six-time Paralympic champion, who has earned huge public admiration for his long battle to be allowed to compete in the Olympics. The common thread for many is disbelief - at the implication this has for the athlete's future but also at the tragic end of the celebrity couple's love story. The pair apparently started dating in November, frequently posted loving messages about each other on social network Twitter and were seen at high-profile events arm in arm. Their relationship seemed perfect. He is known as the \"blade runner\" because of the carbon fibre prosthetic blades he races in. He was born without a fibula in both legs and had his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday. Police were called to his home in the upmarket Silver Woods gated compound on the outskirts of South Africa's administrative capital in the early hours of Thursday morning. They found paramedics treating a 29-year-old woman with four gunshot wounds to the head and upper body. She died at the scene, and officers recovered a 9mm pistol. Early reports suggested Mr Pistorius might have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder. Police say neighbours heard screaming and shouting around the time of the shooting, and that they had been called to investigate incidents of a domestic nature at the same house in the past. They also said that they would oppose any bail application. Hours later, after being questioned by police, Mr Pistorius left a police station accompanied by officers, his face mostly covered by the hood of a grey jacket. His court hearing was originally scheduled for Thursday afternoon but had been postponed until Friday to give forensic investigators time to carry out their work, said Medupe Simasiku, a spokesman for the prosecution. Mr Pistorius's father, Henke, declined to comment but said: \"We all pray for guidance and strength for Oscar and the lady's parents.'' Miss Steenkamp's publicist confirmed to the BBC that the 29-year-old model had died. \"Everyone who knew her is in tears. She was an absolute angel, the sweetest, sweetest human being, a kind human being,\" Sarit Tomlinson said. In her last Twitter messages, Miss Steenkamp had spoken about her excitement about Valentine's Day. \"What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow?'' she tweeted. \"It should be a day of love for everyone.'' Mr Pistorius dominated in his category at successive Paralympic Games, but in 2008 he won a legal battle over his blades - which critics said gave him an unfair advantage - with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF)  for the right to compete in able-bodied competitions.

At the Paralympics he won silver in the T44 200m, gold in the 4x100 relay and gold in the T44 400m, setting a Paralympic record. He was named by Time Magazine last year as one of the world's 100 most influential people. In interviews, he had spoken about his enjoyment of target shooting with his pistol, and an online advertisement featuring him for Nike read: \"I am a bullet in the chamber.\" Mr Pistorius's former coach, Andrea Giannini, spoke out in favour of the athlete following his arrest. \"No matter how bad the situation was, Oscar always stayed calm and positive,'' he told the Associated Press news agency. \"Whenever he was tired or nervous he was still extremely nice to people. I never saw him violent.'' South Africa has one of the highest rates of crime in the world and many residents keep weapons to protect themselves against intruders. But gun ownership is strictly regulated and it is not easy to obtain a licence. On Tuesday, a bill seeking to give police extra powers to arrest anyone carrying a dangerous weapon in public was tabled before parliament, following a spate of violent strikes and protests last year.",

        "document": "The SFA's performance director has been conducting a review since taking over from Mark Wotte. Across the seven schools involved throughout Scotland, 374 children receive up to 10 hours a week specialised coaching as part of their everyday studies. \"There's been a lot of time invested in this project by a lot of people and we're looking at how we continue to improve the programme as we travel through the years,\" McClair told BBC Scotland. The project is now in its fourth year, with this year's intake of pupils the final one of the initial scheme. McClair will decide in the coming months whether it will continue in its current format once an analysis of how it is working has been concluded. Alternatives could include certificating the programme to award pupils a Higher qualification for completing the course or focusing on a smaller group of children at one single, residential campus rather than the seven schools involved just now. At the very least, the current system will continue until this year's S1 pupils have completed fourth year. Gauging its success thus far is tricky, with the oldest participants still only in S4, but McClair believes there are some good indicators. \"I think you can be encouraged by the number of young people who have been in the performance schools who have been in the younger representative squads over the last three-and-a-bit years and the evidence suggests that will continue,\" he added. \"By summertime I think it'll be a half-decent measure of the number of young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full-time football, although I believe that's changing a little bit in the sense that it's 16 or 17 that some clubs are looking at taking them in full-time. \"The idea's great. Many clubs in England have taken it on board - getting kids in during the day, giving them more opportunities to practise the disciplines involved in football. \"The evidence is all there that they're improving quicker than they were previously under a hybrid programme where all the coaching was taking place in the evening or at weekends.\" The other important gauge of success is academic achievement. Academic achievement is important. Academic achievement is a gauge of success. Exam results will not be available from the SFA project until this summer, but Graeme High School in Falkirk ran a pilot scheme - of which Craig Sibbald and Celtic youngster Paul McMullan are graduates - that allows for some analysis. \"Last year we had a group of 14 or 15 and the vast majority were highly successful, able pupils, one with five Highers, two with four Highers, three with three Highers and a suite of other academic achievements,\" headteacher Lesley Carroll told BBC Scotland. \"Most of them have gone on to professional clubs but they have got a fallback position. They have been some of our top-performing academic pupils too because not only do they have to be elite athlete footballers, they have to have what the SFA would call a growth mindset. \"They're not afraid of targets, hard work, commitment, drive and confidence.\" Indeed, Carroll believes there is an argument the programme helps the performance school students achieve better results in their other subjects, though she admits no \"real forensic research has been done into that\". But it will be the level of footballing development that determines exactly how McClair and the SFA proceed in terms of their future performance strategy.

Her 15-year battle for justice finally bore fruit last week, when the Bombay high court confirmed the life sentences of 11 men found guilty of rape and murder. The court also convicted five policemen and two doctors, who were earlier cleared by the trial court, of destroying evidence. The landmark ruling, Bilkis Bano told the BBC in Delhi on Sunday, had finally given her hope of peace. \"I always had full faith in the judiciary and I'm grateful to the Bombay high court for the order. It's a very good judgement and I'm very happy with it,\" she told me. \"I think the state government and the police were all complicit in the crime, because the accused were given full freedom to rape and pillage,\" she said. \"I feel vindicated that the court has convicted the police and the doctors too. I feel I've received justice.\" Bilkis Bano's fight for justice has been long and nightmarish but, she says, giving up was never an option. It has been well documented that some police and state officials tried to intimidate her, evidence was destroyed and the dead were buried without post-mortems. The doctors who examined her said she hadn't been raped, and she received death threats. Despite the gravity of the crime and the fact she identified her attackers, the first arrests in the case were only made in 2004 after India's Supreme Court handed over the case to federal investigators, the Central Bureau of Investigation. A crime was committed. The victim identified her attackers. The first arrests in the case were made in 2004. India's Supreme Court handed over the case to federal investigators. The case was handled by the Central Bureau of Investigation. The Supreme Court also accepted her plea that the courts in Gujarat could not deliver her justice and transferred her case to a court in Mumbai. The battle has been hugely disruptive for her family. In the past 15 years, she and her husband Yakub Rasool have moved home 10 times, moving in and out of Gujarat with their five children. \"We still can't go home because we're afraid. Police and the state administration have always helped our attackers. When we are in Gujarat, we still cover our faces, we never give out our address,\" Mr Rasool said. The attack on Bilkis Bano and her family was one of the most horrific crimes during the riots, which began when a fire on a passenger train in Godhra town killed 60 Hindu pilgrims. Blaming Muslims for starting the fire, Hindu mobs went on a rampage, attacking Muslim neighbourhoods and destroying their property. For three days the rioters had free rein, as the state administration and the police looked the other way. More than 1,000 people died, most of them Muslims. More than 1,000 people died. Most of the people who died were Muslims. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was then Gujarat chief minister, was criticised for not doing enough to prevent the carnage. He has always denied any wrongdoing and has not apologised for the riots. A Supreme Court panel also refused to prosecute him in 2013, citing insufficient evidence. But he's never been able to shake off the criticism completely, with many holding him responsible for the killings on his watch. Over the years, the courts have convicted dozens of people for their involvement in the riots. In 2012 an ex-minister and aide to Mr Modi was jailed for 28 years. But many other people are still waiting for justice. Fifteen years later, Bilkis Bano still fights back tears as she recounts the horror of those days. She was visiting her parents, who lived in a village called Randhikpur, not far from Godhra. She was 19 and the mother of a three-year-old daughter, and she was pregnant with her second child. \"It was the morning after the train fire. There was a train fire. The morning after the train fire is the time setting of the sentence. I was in the kitchen, making lunch, when my aunt and her children came running. They said their homes were being set on fire and we had to leave immediately,\" she said. \"We left with just the clothes we were wearing, we didn't even have the time to put on our slippers.\" Within minutes, all the Muslim homes in the neighbourhood had emptied. The 50-odd families that lived there had gone, looking for safety. Bilkis Bano was in a group of 17 people that included her three-year-old daughter, her mother, a pregnant cousin, her younger siblings, nieces and nephews, and two adult men. \"We first went to the village council head, a Hindu, seeking his protection. But when the mobs began threatening to kill him too if he gave shelter to Muslims, we were forced to leave.\" For the next few days, the group travelled from village to village, seeking shelter in a mosque, or subsisting on the kindness of Hindu neighbours. But then their time ran out. On the morning of 3 March, as they set out to go to a nearby village where they believed they would be safer, a group of men travelling in two jeeps stopped them. \"They attacked us with swords and sticks. One of them snatched my daughter from my lap and threw her on the ground, bashing her head into a rock.\" Bilkis Bano had cuts on her hands and legs. Bilkis Bano had cuts. Bilkis Bano had cuts on her hands. Bilkis Bano had cuts on her legs. Her attackers were her neighbours in the village, 12 men she had seen almost daily while growing up. They tore off her clothes and several of them raped her. She begged them for mercy and told them she was five months' pregnant, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. Her cousin, who had delivered a baby girl two days earlier while they were on the run, was raped and murdered. Her newborn was killed too. Bilkis Bano survived because she lost consciousness and her attackers left, believing she was dead. Two boys - seven and four - were the only other survivors of the massacre. When she came to, she covered her body with a blood-soaked petticoat, climbed a nearby hill and hid in a cave for a day. \"The next day I was very thirsty so I came down to a nearby tribal village to find some water. The villagers were initially suspicious of me and came out with sticks, but then they helped me. They gave me a blouse and a scarf to cover my body.\" She spotted a police jeep and they took her to the police station, where she narrated her ordeal. \"I'm illiterate so I asked the policemen to read out the complaint once they had written it down, but they refused to do that. They just took my thumb impression and wrote whatever they wanted. I knew all my attackers and I'd named them. But the police did not write down any names,\" she said. The next day, she was sent to a camp in Godhra set up for those displaced by the riots. That's where her husband was reunited with her 15 days later and where they lived for the next few months. Her unborn child survived the rape and she later gave birth to a daughter. The past 15 years have been \"very difficult\", but the couple say the high court order has brought them some closure. In the past few days, comparisons have been drawn between Bilkis Bano's case and that of the 2012 gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a bus in the Indian capital, Delhi. A day after the Bilkis Bano judgement, the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentences of the four men accused of the crime. Many have since asked whether Bilkis Bano's case did not merit the death penalty for her attackers. Prosecutors had demanded capital punishment for three of the men. Bilkis Bano, however, says she does not believe in revenge. \"Both the crimes were equally horrible, but I don't believe in taking anyone's life. I don't want the death penalty for them,\" she said. \"I want them to spend their entire lives in jail. I hope they will one day realise the enormity of their crime, how they killed small children and raped women. \"I'm not interested in revenge. I just want them to understand what they've done.\"",

They are young and clever, and they want to change the world - one bus at a time. \"We've created the world's first bus that runs on formic acid, which is a much cheaper solution than hydrogen, yet it delivers the same environmental benefits,\" says Lucas van Cappellen from Team Fast, a spin-off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. \"We're building our own future.\" Around 40 of his fellow students are endeavouring to develop emissions-free transport that will help in the global battle against climate change. Around 40 fellow students are working on a project. The project aims to develop emissions-free transport. The project is related to the global battle against climate change. And they're also trying to create careers for themselves. Formic acid is found in nature, delivered in the stings and bites of ants and other insects - the Latin word for ant is formica. And this simple carboxylic acid (chemical formula HCOOH) is already used in textiles and leather processing, as a livestock feed preservative, and is also found in some household limescale removers. But Team Fast has found a way the acid can efficiently carry the ingredients needed for hydrogen fuel cells, used to power electric vehicles. Team Fast has found a way. The way involves acid. The acid can carry ingredients. The ingredients are needed for hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cells are used to power electric vehicles. The fuel, which the team has dubbed hydrozine (not to be confused with hydrazine), is a liquid, which means you can transport it easily and refill vehicles quickly, as with conventional fuels. The difference is that it is much cleaner. \"The tailpipe emissions are only CO2 and water,\" explains Mr van Cappellen. \"No other harmful gases like nitric oxides, soot or sulphuric oxides are emitted.\" To prove the concept in the real world, an electric bus is set to hit the road in the Netherlands later this year, where it will shuttle between running on conventional bus routes and appearing at promotional events and industry fairs. The bus has an electric drive system, developed by bus builder VDL, that receives additional power from the formic acid fuel cell system mounted in a range-extender trailer, towed behind. \"Our tank is around 300 litres, so we will extend the range of the bus by 200km (180 miles). However, we could of course make the tank bigger very easily,\" says Mr van Cappellen. Current hydrogen fuel cell buses have a range of up to 400km. But why develop a bus rather than a car? \"If we built a car, we would compete with electric cars, but we believe battery-powered cars are a good solution for a lot of people,\" says Mr van Cappellen. \"But if we prove that we can build a bus that meets the needs of bus companies, with a range of around 400km and quick refuelling, we will have shown the potential of hydrozine in a segment where there is no sustainable competition yet.\" Hydrozine is created through a chemical reaction between water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). More Technology of Business. \"In a reactor, water and CO2 are bonded using sustainable electricity. This is a direct, sustainable electrochemical process,\" explains Mr van Cappellen. The hydrozine is then broken down by a catalyst into hydrogen and carbon dioxide inside a piece of kit called a reformer that Team Fast is attempting to patent. Its newly designed reformer is a tenth of the size of reformers of the past, which is why \"it is now applicable in transport applications for the first time\". The hydrogen is then added to a fuel cell where it reacts with oxygen to generate the electricity that powers the electric motor. \"We are continuously looking for new technologies that can extend the range of zero emissions traffic in a simple way,\" says Menno Kleingeld, managing director, VDL Enabling Transport Solutions. \"The decomposition of formic acid into hydrogen gas is one of these new, promising technologies.\" But does it really stand a chance of becoming commercially viable? \"It costs about 35,000 euros (Â£30,000) to convert a conventional petrol filling station to a hydrozine filling station, a process that essentially involves replacing the pipes and coating the tanks,\" says Mr van Cappellen. As such, it is \"100 times cheaper\" to roll out a fuelling network for hydrozine than for gaseous hydrogen, he maintains. \"Hydrozine is currently cheaper than petrol and more expensive than diesel in the Netherlands, and in future we expect prices to come down so it will be cheaper than both,\" he adds. Although the bus emits CO2, Team Fast argues that the original CO2 used to create the hydrozine is taken from existing sources, such as air or exhaust fumes, so that no additional CO2 is produced - it's a closed carbon cycle in the jargon. Some experts believe the technology shows promise. \"Team Fast has a very good project,\" says Professor Richard van de Sanden, head of the Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research. \"It works on a very important issue: the storing of renewable energy in a transportable form and in a form which can actually be used.\" And several companies are supporting the project. \"What we're working on together is a version of renewable energy that can combine renewable energy with CO2 capture,\" says Martijn de Graaff, senior business development manager at TNO Industry. \"If we achieve this it will give us a stable future.\" The students' own commitment is impressive, with 15 of the 40 working full time on the project, and the rest contributing at least 20-25 hours per week. \"We don't get study points for it, but you can only learn so much at university about the practical experience of things,\" Mr van Cappellen says. \"It's our own future we're making.\"",

        "document": "The New York businessman-turned-politician said many controversial things and flip-flopped on a number of policy positions during the campaign. Here, we look back at 24 of his professed beliefs. The US should use waterboarding. This and other methods of \"strong interrogation\" should be deployed in its fight against the Islamic State group. These methods, Mr Trump said, are \"peanuts\" compared to the tactics used by the militants, such as beheadings. \"I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough,\" he said in June of the banned practice. Mexico should pay for the \"great, great wall\" Mr Trump has said he wants to start building the much-touted wall on the shared border from the first day of his presidency, and that Mexico will pay for it. In some of his earliest campaign comments, he suggested that Mexicans coming to the US were criminals and \"rapists\". BBC analysis estimates the border wall could cost between $2.2bn and $13bn. Muslims should not be admitted to the US. In the wake of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, Mr Trump wrote that he was \"calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on\". He's since gone back on the announcement, instead saying that that he would temporarily suspend \"immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism\". Arab-Americans cheered the attacks on 9/11. Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that on 11 September 2001, there were thousands of Arab-Americans celebrating in New Jersey after two planes flew into the Twin Towers. He says such public demonstrations \"tell you something\" about Muslims living in the US. However, there are no media reports to back up the claim. Obamacare is a \"disaster\". Obamacare is a disaster. Mr Trump says he wants Congress to fully repeal the president's Affordable Care Act, which aims at extending the number of Americans with health insurance, but he believes that \"everybody's got to be covered\". A spokesman for Mr Trump said he would propose \"a health plan that will return authority to the states and operate under free market principles\". The increase in premiums revealed just before the election bolstered the Trump attacks. Climate change is just \"weather\" While Mr Trump believes that maintaining \"clean air\" and \"clean water\" is important, he has dismissed climate change science as a \"hoax\" and believes environmental restrictions on businesses make them less competitive in the global marketplace. \"I do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country,\" he told CNN on the issue. \"It costs so much and nobody knows exactly if it's going to work.\" The world would be better off if Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi were still in power. Mr Trump told CNN that he believes the situation in both Libya and Iraq is \"far worse\" than it ever was under the leaders of the two countries. While he concedes Saddam was a \"horrible guy\", he says he did a better job combating terrorists. Illegal migrants should be deported. Trump once said that he wanted to deport all of the approximately 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the US, despite criticism that this idea is both xenophobic, next to impossible and prohibitively expensive - the BBC estimates a cost of $114bn. His official policy now says only those with criminal records will be deported immediately, although immigration controls will still be massively beefed up. Any undocumented migrants would also face the risk of deportation. Syrian refugees could be a \"Trojan horse\" He says that the Paris attacks prove that even a handful of terrorists posing as migrants could do catastrophic damage, and so he will oppose resettling any Syrians in the US, and deport those who have already been resettled. It's unclear if he still believes that deportations are necessary, though he has still vowed to suspend the intake of Syrian refugees. Vladimir Putin is a \"leader\" He has noted the Russian president's \"great control over his country\" and criticised the state of the relations between it and the US. He told CNN: \"I would probably get along with him very well. And I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now\". More recently he has said that Mr Putin doesn't \"respect\" the US, although that was no reason to get tough on him. Taxes should be reduced for everyone. Trump wants to condense the current seven tax brackets to just three, with no income tax for \"low-income Americans\". He would lower the business tax to 15%, from 35%. He would also allow multinational companies keeping profits overseas to repatriate their cash at a 10% tax rate. Hedge fund managers are \"getting away with murder\" Mr Trump found common ground with Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren when he said that hedge fund managers and the ultra-wealthy did not pay enough taxes. However, after the campaign released specifics of his plan, analysts argued that hedge fund managers would actually get a tax cut along with the middle class. China should be taken to task on a number of trade-related issues. He has said he will make China stop undervaluing its currency, and force it to step up its environmental and labour standards. He is also critical of the county's lax attitude towards American intellectual property and hacking. The Black Lives Matter movement is \"trouble\" Mr Trump mocked former Democratic candidates like Martin O'Malley for apologising to members of the protest movement against police brutality and cast himself as a pro-law enforcement candidate. \"I think they're looking for trouble,\" he once said of the activist group. He also tweeted a controversial and widely debunked graphic purporting to show that African Americans kill white and black people at far higher rates than white people or police officers. He's worth $10bn. Based on Mr Trump's 92-page personal financial disclosure form, Bloomberg calculated last year that the real estate mogul was worth about $2.9bn, while Forbes recently put Trump's net worth at $3.7bn. Mr Trump has however insisted that he is worth \"in excess\" of $10bn. Mr Trump has insisted that he is worth more than $10bn. Mr Trump has insisted that he is worth \"in excess\" of $10bn. Veteran healthcare in the US needs a major overhaul. Mr Trump wants to clear out the executive level in the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying that waiting times for doctor visits have only increased after previous interventions failed. Thousands of veterans have died while waiting for care, he says. He will invest in the treatment of \"invisible wounds\" like post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He would also increase the number of doctors who specialise in women's health to help care for the increasing number of female veterans. Lobbyists should be more restricted. Mr Trump proposes that there be a five-year ban that prevents government officials and members of congress from leaving and then immediately becoming lobbyists. He also calls for a lifetime ban on senior administration officials from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. He is a \"really nice guy\" In Trump's most recent book, Crippled America, he writes that \"I'm a really nice guy, believe me, I pride myself on being a nice guy but I'm also passionate and determined to make our country great again\". The news site Gawker points out that he calls himself a \"nice guy\" throughout the book, and Mr Trump repeated that self-assessment in his opening monologue on Saturday Night Live and in an interview with the Washington Post. He could not have groped an unattractive woman. A video from 2005 showed Mr Trump making obscene comments about women and triggered numerous claims of alleged sexual harassment. At one rally, he suggested that one of the accusers - a \"horrible woman\" - was not attractive enough for him to have groped: \"I don't think so! I don't think so!\" Tokyo and Seoul should build up nuclear arsenals. He has said Japan and South Korea should not rely on the US so much and would benefit from having their own weapons. Nuclear war between Japan and North Korea may be \"terrible\" but it would be \"pretty quick\". The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) is a \"rip-off\" Why? Because the US pays more than anyone else. But he later said he was \"all\" in favour of the alliance. Doctors should be punished for administering abortions. Or should they? In an interview with MSNBC, Mr Trump said that if abortion were to become illegal, women should be punished for obtaining them. He then retracted, saying the doctor would be responsible and he or she should be punished, instead. The Republican National Committee's rules were \"stacked against him\" He called the delegate system \"crooked\" and \"unfair\". He repeatedly clashed with the RNC over its nomination process and how it treated his candidacy during the primaries. He called rules that allowed Senator Ted Cruz to gain more delegates than him in some states \"rigged\", as he did later when talking about the electoral process when polls were showing Hillary Clinton ahead of him. The federal minimum wage should be raised. Workers should be paid more than the current level of $7.25/hour, he has said. though this is another issue he has flip-flopped on repeatedly.

So, before we get all Doctor Who, let's take a look at some top facts about the exciting moon for ET-spotters... Enceladus is the sixth largest moon of Saturn. It is about 500 kilometres (310 miles) in diameter, making it pretty small. In comparison, the Earth is over 12,000 kilometres in diameter. Saturn has many different types of moons, some are very small, and one - Titan - is very, very large! Altogether, Saturn has 62 confirmed moons, 53 of which have names, and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometres. Enceladus is named after a giant from Greek mythology. The name was decided by the son of the man who first discovered it, astronomer Frederick William Herschel. He spotted Enceladus all the way back in 1789, during the first use of his new telescope, which was the largest in the world at the time. Enceladus is covered in a thick surface of ice. But it's what lies deep below this icy surface that has got scientists really excited! It's thought a warm ocean flows below the surface, where the conditions to support life could exist. Jets of water vapour and ice particles erupt from Enceladus' underground ocean through deep icy crevasses called tiger stripes near the moon's south pole. These plumes have provided clues about the planets inner-workings. The Cassini spacecraft conducted a fly-through of the plumes, helping to provide the data that has led scientists to believe the planet could hold life.

The government brought in the requirement in the wake of the Trojan Horse allegations, which suggested there had been attempts by groups of hardline Muslims to take over schools in Birmingham. Earlier this month a committee of MPs said that apart from one incident in one school \"no evidence of extremism or radicalisation was found by any of the inquiries in any of the schools involved\".

He acknowledged this would impact on civilian and military staff but provisions were being made, he said. The sites include an RAF base, barracks, ex-World War Two airfields and a chaplaincy centre. They also include two golf courses at RAF Henlow and Southwick Park in Hampshire. Meanwhile, Network Rail has announced it will release land at almost 200 sites for 12,000 new homes by 2020. Network Rail has announced a plan. The plan involves releasing land at almost 200 sites. The land will be used for 12,000 new homes. The new homes will be built by 2020. This includes 5,000 homes in London, 3,600 homes in Manchester and the north, 1,700 homes in the Midlands and the east of England and 1,400 homes in the south of England. The 13 military sites that will be sold by the MoD are:. The MoD will sell 13 military sites. The MoD said the land at Venning and Parsons Barracks are the only sites that will not have housing built on them, as they will be used for commercial development at the request of Telford and Wrekin Council. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: \"We are getting rid of land that we don't need to build homes that we do, generating hundreds of millions of pounds in the process. \"Our commitment to protect and increase the budget for our armed forces means that every penny of that will be reinvested into defence, helping to keep Britain safe.\" But shadow defence secretary Clive Lewis said: \"Affordable housing is desperately needed across the UK, particularly by service families, who have seen the cost of their housing go up as conditions get worse. \"So it's disappointing that the MoD has failed to say how many of these potential new homes will be affordable, or how many could be set aside for service personnel. \"In fact, they cannot even reassure us that these sites will be used to build new homes at all,\" he said. \"What we're looking at is the double impact of 18,000 MoD staff losing their jobs and public land potentially being sold on the cheap for developers to profit from,\" a Public and Commercial Services union spokesman said. \"The government must learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure any land sold not only realises its full value, but that house-builders are forced to ensure enough affordable homes are provided.\" In a written statement, Mr Lancaster said consultations will take place over the coming weeks with \"stakeholders\" including trade unions, to determine the future of each site and their occupants. \"The release of land by the MoD has the potential to provide land for new homes and we will continue to engage with impacted local authorities to determine how the department's assessment of housing unit allocation against each site may be considered as part of the authority's Local Plan,\" he said. \"I acknowledge that these moves will have an impact upon civilian and military staff; the department is making arrangements to provide for units and functions based at sites which will not have a future defence requirement.\" An MoD spokeswoman said it was too early to confirm how exactly it would affect staff at the sites, but she said \"the majority\" will be provided for and moved to accommodation elsewhere, for example. Mr Lancaster said the sales would contribute £225m towards the MoD's £1bn target for land release sales, as set out in its spending review last year. The release of the sites contributes to the government commitment to provide land for 160,000 homes by 2020, he said.

The RSPB welcomed the initiative. The RSPB said the lack of a national bird for Britain was a \"glaring omission\". Mr Lindo, the self-styled \"Urban Birder\", told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I want to encourage the great British public to vote for the bird that best represents all that is great about this nation.\" He hoped the appointment could be \"the first act\" of a new government, once the dust has settled from \"the other election\", he told the programme. The robin has emerged as an early favourite, but Mr Lindo, who is backing the blackbird, told Today: \"People consider the robin as a British bird - but [like] a lot of our native birds... some of the population move south to Iberia for the winter and are replaced by immigrants from the continent. \"So the robin you see in your back garden during winter is not necessarily British born.\" And he added: \"It is quite a violent bird.\" A first round of polling on the campaign's website received 70,000 votes. A first round of polling occurred. The campaign's website was involved. The polling received 70,000 votes. One of England's rarest birds, the hen harrier, is something of a surprise contender, according to Mr Lindo. \"I was expecting 10 garden birds in the list,\" he said, adding that the original pool of 60 candidates included favourites from literature and song such as the turtledove, nightingale and skylark - all of which have dropped out of contention. The hen harrier, which was the subject of a recent campaign because it had been the target of illegal hunting, was down to just one breeding pair a couple of years ago  and \"may already be extinct\", he said. The robin is sometimes mistakenly thought of as the nation's official bird, the RSPB said, after it was given the title unofficially by some enthusiasts in the 1960s. Northern Ireland does not have an official national bird, while the golden eagle and red kite are sometimes regarded as unofficial national symbols of Scotland and Wales respectively. In December 2013 a petition was lodged by the RSPB for the golden eagle to be recognised as Scotland's official national symbol, but the Scottish parliament voted against the plans after it decided the RSPB needed to do more to show greater support for the proposals. The RSPB said it welcomed Mr Lindo's initiative in getting people to discuss their favourite birds. The RSPB welcomed Mr Lindo's initiative.

The final report was drafted by Home Office officials but some members of the panel, which included three people who also sit on the ACMD, insisted on writing in what became known as the \"safety-valve\" clause. The recommendation for \"general prohibition\" was amended to say that there should be exemptions for substances \"where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed\". The line was included specifically to ensure that some low risk products could be excluded from the ban. The coalition government response last October went along with the safety-valve clause saying it would \"explore how to put in place a schedule of exemptions and make provision to add to these where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed\".

The LibDem Home Affairs spokesman Lord Paddick has made it clear his party will oppose the legislation in its current form. \"As drafted, the Bill is far too broad and indiscriminate, further undermining credibility and efficacy in reducing harm,\" he told the House of Lords. The Bill would ban any substance that affects a consumer's \"mental functioning or emotional state\", unless specifically exempted by the Home Secretary. This definition goes further than the Irish legislation on which the approach is modelled. In Ireland, a psychoactive substance is defined as one that results in \"a significant disturbance in, or significant change to, motor function, thinking, behaviour, perception, awareness or mood\". The word \"significant\" is, of course, significant. The word \"significant\" is an important word. It provides the safety valve that excludes low-risk and low-harm products.

The complexity of their needs is increasing. ADASS called for the government to \"protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community\".

The spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\". \"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. \"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further £1bn coming out of social care budgets was \"chilling\". Sue Brown, vice chairman of the Care and Support Alliance - which represents 80 leading charities - said the figures \"confirm what we already know - that the care system is in worsening crisis\". She said \"chronic underfunding\" of adult social care had seen \"dramatic year-on-year rationing of support, excluding hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people from the care they desperately need\". Janet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: \"This worrying survey shows how the frail and elderly in our society are being hit by year on year cutbacks to council services.\" \"It's vital now more than ever that we have an honest debate about the true costs of providing social care, not just health care,\" she added.",

The materials could be used to sheath artificial limbs or to create robots that can pick up and hold fragile objects. They could also be used to improve tools for minimally-invasive surgery. In one approach, Ali Javey at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues built up layers of criss-crossed nanometre-scale wires topped with a thin rubber sheet. Together, the stack acts as what is known as a thin-film transistor, or TFT, with a pressure-sensitive layer on top. The amount of electrical current running through the device is dependent upon how much pressure is exerted on the rubber sheet; more pressure allows more current to flow. The team demonstrated the flexibility of their TFT stacks by bending them to a radius smaller than that of a pencil without changing the skin's performance. \"Javey's work is a nice demonstration of their capability in making a large array of nanowire TFTs,\" said Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, whose group demonstrated the second approach. The heart of Professor Bao's devices is micro-structured rubber sheet in the middle of the TFT - effectively re-creating the functionality of the Berkeley group's skins with less layers. \"Instead of laminating a pressure-sensitive resistor array on top of a nanowire TFT array, we made our transistors to be pressure sensitive,\" Professor Bao explained to BBC News. \"Our microstructured rubber can bounce back to its original shape much faster and enable higher sensitivity,\" she added. The overall flexibility of the Stanford group's skins appears to be lower, and Professor Bao concedes that to develop her group's approach further, better conductive rubber will be needed. Nevertheless, both groups demonstrate that their skins can register a pressure in a tenth of a second, over a large range - from five grams per square centimetre to 40 times that high. Those numbers rival the response of human skin, made with relatively inexpensive manufacturing techniques. John Boland, a nanotechnologist from Trinity College Dublin, praised the two approaches in a critique for Nature Materials. \"Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of these studies is how they elegantly demonstrate that it is possible to exploit well-established processing technologies to engineer low-cost innovative solutions to important technical problems,\" he wrote. However, he notes that there are still \"significant opportunities for further innovation\", such as reducing the distance between the sensors in the arrays to maximise the detail they could \"feel\", as well as improvements that could make large-area arrays possible and affordable.",

        "document": "Warning: Readers may find some of the details of violence in this piece distressing. It was late October 2014, and on paper the young banker had lived what could only be described as a privileged and successful life. But over the space of a few drug- and alcohol-fuelled days, he tortured and killed Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, before calling the police to let them know what he had done. In court, lawyers described a much darker side to his apparently gilded existence, one involving drugs, sexual sadism, and an extreme personality disorder. Jutting had tortured Ms Ningsih for three days, before he killed her by slashing her throat over a prolonged period, nearly decapitating her. He then hid her body in a suitcase. A few days later, Jutting brought his second victim, Ms Mujiasih, to his flat. This was a woman he would go on to describe simply as \"the prey\" he had been hunting. \"Sumarti was generous. That much is clear from the evidence in the house. Her driving force was to improve life for her family, to make them richer. Life may be peaceful in the village but she would have been all too aware of the possibilities of a life with more material comforts.\" The story of Sumarti: Born in Indonesia, murdered in Hong Kong. Experts for the defence say Jutting's IQ score is 137 - putting him in the top 1% of the population. But they also diagnosed him with four disorders, which they said combined to lead to the killings:. •Narcissistic personality disorder. •Sexual sadism disorder. •Cocaine use disorder. •Alcohol use disorder. Prosecution witnesses argued that such conditions should not \"substantially\" diminish his ability to control his actions. But according to the defence, when it came to his narcissism, the signs were there from an early age. Jutting was born in London in 1985. Jutting was born in London. Jutting was born in 1985. His first name Rurik was chosen by his mother, and literally translated as \"great one\" - it was an imperial dynasty in Russia. He described himself as an ambitious boy who had a happy childhood. But even from a young age, Jutting displayed feelings of superiority and entitlement, his defence argued. He was admitted to the prestigious private school Winchester College in his early teens but was disappointed that he ranked sixth in the scholarship selection, rather than first. When his mother expressed delight at his entrance exam results, Jutting commented that he found her reaction \"almost insulting\", because it implied that she was surprised he had got in. There were other troubling episodes. When he was 16, his father tried to take his own life by slashing his wrists while he was in the house. Jutting had to help provide the initial care and go to hospital with him. Jutting also said he had been sexually assaulted by another student while studying at Winchester. In 2003, he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said he experienced suicidal thoughts and that he was affected by knowledge of his parents' marital problems and concerns about his mother's health. Nonetheless, Jutting excelled academically, being admitted to Cambridge University to study history and law at Peterhouse college. A fellow of the college, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC Mr Jutting was ambitious, a keen athlete, committed to his studies and from a stable Catholic background. British banker guilty of murders. British banker is guilty. British banker is guilty of murders. Killed by Jutting and forgotten by Indonesia. 'We were lucky it wasn't us' (video) Jutting gained first class honours in his history degree but was disappointed to receive a 2:1 in law, and challenged the examiner's approach. The inability to accept criticism, psychiatrists said, was another sign of his narcissistic personality traits. On graduation, Jutting worked at Barclays bank, before being head-hunted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. His role involved developing complex tax products and, within a few years, his salary had risen to £270,000 ($334,705) per year. But then, things began to go wrong. In 2012, while trying to market a tax product in Luxembourg, auditors began investigating his team for possible violation of regulations, flagging up Jutting in particular as a serious risk to the organisation. Jutting described this as a \"negative turning point\" in his career and felt his move to Hong Kong the subsequent year had been arranged by bosses to get him out of the way. At one point, his manager told Jutting he was one of the most unpredictable people he had ever worked with. Jutting's alcohol use was also uncontrollable around this time, as he needed to drink excessive amounts in order to get to sleep. His then-girlfriend was so worried about his reliance on alcohol she banned him from drinking at home. He briefly saw a psychiatrist at this point, and said he often felt down and tearful at work. By the time he had moved to Hong Kong in October 2013, he was consuming three quarters of a bottle of vodka to sleep and using cocaine. He said he smuggled cocaine up his rectum on his flight to Hong Kong. Once in Hong Kong, he rented a flat in The J Residence, a luxury development in Wanchai popular with expatriate workers. Although located in a busy street in the heart of the city, the development gives off a sense of exclusivity. Keycards are needed to access individual floors, while the sheer height of the building, at over 41 floors, means that residents can enjoy views of Hong Kong's skyline - from the bar, garden, and even swimming pool on the roof. But Jutting described himself as feeling increasingly despondent and nihilistic in the city. He did not have much of a social life  and spent long periods drinking at home while playing computer games. Jutting also had extreme sexual interests, and an obsession with sadistic pornography, experts said. He began using sex workers in 2009 and as time went on his behaviour became increasingly forceful. On a number of occasions, he removed condoms during sex without their consent, despite knowing this would constitute rape in the UK. Jutting continued to fantasise about rape and kidnap even while he was remanded in a psychiatric centre after his arrest, prosecution expert Dr Kavin Chow said. By 2014, he was \"spiralling out of control\". He would go on cocaine binges that lasted for days. At one point, he missed a scheduled meeting in London and, as an excuse, he told his boss he had HIV. He developed a round-the-clock craving for the drug, his weight ballooned and in the weeks before the killings took place he stopped going to work. Instead, he spent hours watching and reading violent pornography. He attempted to find men on Grindr to have sex with, later telling a psychologist he had been \"trying to do everything I could to get new experiences\", but described everything as \"disappointing\". On 25 October 2014 Jutting took Ms Ningsih to his flat, after offering to pay her for sex. They had had sex on one occasion before, in a hotel, but things had got so violent that Ms Ningsih asked to end the session early, and refunded half his money. On this second occasion, the sex also switched from consensual to non-consensual, as Jutting began to beat Ms Ningsih. He then held her captive, and tortured her using pliers, his belt, sex toys and his hands. He filmed some of the torture on his phone, in footage that was shown to the jury. The details that follow are distressing and brutal. Jutting claims he drifted in and out of the influence of cocaine: \"When I became relatively less under the influence of cocaine I became quite apologetic - I told her repeatedly I loved her,\" he said in one police interview. Yet, in another interview, he said that he hadn't tortured Ms Ningsih as much as he would have liked, before killing her. He killed her on the third day, after he made her kneel in front of the toilet bowl, with her hands tied behind her back, and lick the bowl. He then cut her throat with a knife but Ms Ningsih did not die immediately, so her dragged her into the shower and continued. Jutting recorded several videos describing the aftermath of the killing on his phone. Eventually, he wrapped up the body and placed it into a suitcase, which he left on the balcony. Jutting began planning to torture a second victim on 31 October. He bought tools, including sandpaper, nails and a blow torch, filming them on his iPhone, describing how he might use them to torture a victim. That night, he went out and met Ms Mujiasih, inviting her back to his flat for sex. They began kissing and cuddling on the sofa but Ms Mujiasih began shouting when she saw a gag by the sofa. Jutting held a knife against her throat, telling her he would kill her if she continued to struggle. She continued struggling, and he killed her by slashing at her neck. He later told police: \"She was simply, the word I'd use is prey. I was hunting for prey and she was unfortunately the person who was hunted\". After taking more cocaine, he says he contemplated taking his own life. He eventually called 999. He also called his boss, saying: \"I'm in a lot of trouble, you need to do something about the reputation of the bank.\" Even though he had not been to work in the two weeks leading up to the killings, the office was still on his mind. After he killed Ms Ningsih, he changed the out-of-office message from his work email to: \"I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody. [Last line only really worked if I had followed through..]\" On one occasion, according to an expert witness, Jutting likened his life to The Truman Show, a movie starring Jim Carrey about a man who's entire life, unbeknownst to him, is a TV show. This too may reflect his narcissism because Jutting wanted to believe that \"his life was so significant that… millions of people would be interested in watching it\". He is now likely to spend much if not all of it in jail.",

Mike Cherry is the National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). Natwest and RBS issued a warning. The warning from Natwest and RBS \"will be deeply concerning to small firms\". The FSB also urged the Bank of England to consider the impact on smaller firms of cutting interest rates. Mike Amey, a managing director at investment firm Pimco, said the two banks were \"giving themselves wiggle room in the very unlikely event\" that the Bank turns the official interest rate negative. \"The Bank of England sets the interest rate next week, so the fact they put this out this week... is possibly a bit of a reminder to the Bank of England there are negative consequences,\" he told the BBC. UK interest rates have been unchanged since the Bank of England cut them to a record low of 0.5% in March 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. The Bank kept them on hold earlier this month, despite speculation it would cut rates further. But Bank governor Mark Carney has said it is likely \"some monetary policy easing\" will be required to boost the UK economy in response to the Brexit vote. However, he has said he does not favour rates falling any lower than 0.25%. Nevertheless, some economists believe that rates could still be cut to zero or lower later this year. When the rate goes below zero, the normal relationship between banks and customers is reversed. Instead of the lender getting paid interest by the bank for allowing it to use their money, the lender has to pay the bank for holding their money. The underlying idea is much the same as cutting interest rates in more normal times. The aim is to encourage more borrowing and spending by firms and less saving. In 2014, the European Central Bank was the first major central bank to introduce negative interest rates, with the aim of encouraging banks to lend to businesses rather than hold on to money.",

It's easy to understand why. On 26 and 27 April junior doctors will stop providing emergency cover - unlike in the previous strikes in the contract dispute. Junior doctors will stop providing emergency cover. The stop of emergency cover will occur on 26 and 27 April. It means as well as downing tools for their routine duties, medics will walk out of A&E units and intensive care departments, leaving some of the sickest and most vulnerable patients in the hands of others. But will the reality of the all-out strike be really as bad as the rhetoric? After all, the doctors' code of conduct produced by the General Medical Council decrees they must not harm patients or put them at risk. And the British Medical Association is adamant the stoppages do not breach this code because of the contingency plans being put in place. The union is legally bound to give the NHS seven days' notice of industrial action. The union is legally bound. The union is legally bound to give the NHS seven days' notice. The union is legally bound to give the NHS seven days' notice of industrial action. In this case the health service has had five weeks. There is a case. The case involves the health service. The health service has had five weeks. The time has allowed hospital bosses to carefully consider what they need and put plans in place. This has been done in partnership with BMA reps, while at a national level Department of Health and NHS England officials have been meeting regularly to ensure the contingency arrangements are satisfactory . And as yet no hospital has yet said it cannot cope. This is because large chunks of the routine work has been postponed and staff will be redeployed into emergency areas. There will be consultants, staff doctors - those who are not in training but have not yet reached consultant level - nurses, midwives and health care assistants in work. GPs are also being asked to keep a greater number of appointments free for urgent on-the-day cases than normal, while patients will be warned in the lead-up to the strike to think carefully about how they use the health service during the stoppages. The result is that there are plenty of people who think the system will run pretty smoothly. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Royal College of Emergency Medicine have both released statements saying they are satisfied with the arrangements being put in place. In fact, you could argue the result in some departments may be that the system may actually work better than on a normal day. Take A&E, for example. Having more consultants on the floor could actually speed up the flow of patients as they will be able to make quick decisions about the care patients need. Although there is an argument the smaller hospitals with fewer consultants may find it more difficult. Meanwhile, in emergency surgery and intensive care the presence of consultants should, in theory, more than make up for the absence of the juniors. Also, it should be remembered that the stoppages are from 08:00 to 17:00 BST - not for 24 or 48 hours as the previous strikes have been - so there will be some respite during the two days. Instead, the problems might be more run of the mill. Junior doctors play a vital role chasing up test results, ordering x-rays, taking bloods, ordering prescriptions and preparing patients for discharge. Consultants may not have the time to do some of these, their skills may be a little rusty or they may simply not know their way round the system to get on top of the jobs. Senior nurses will be able to take some of the strain, but there is bound to be disruption. However, that doesn't mean the concerns being voiced are not justified. Talking to those who work in the service, there does seem to be a weak spot. There is a weak spot in talking to those who work in the service. It concerns what happens if there is an unexpected emergency on a general or surgical ward or perhaps in a psychiatric unit. When a patient collapses, a junior doctor would normally be one of the first on the scene. If they aren't there and a patient dies, questions will be naturally asked. And this, perhaps, is the crux of the matter. It was a point made by Prof Lord Darzi of Denham, a surgeon and former health minister, in an article in the Daily Telegraph.. He wrote that every family afflicted with heartbreak on the strike days \"would always wonder\" whether loved ones would have lived if junior doctors had been there. Trust between doctors and society might be \"irreparably damaged\", he warned. This blog was first published on 15 April, but has since been updated to take into account subsequent developments.

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The Nobel committee praised him for a peace deal signed with Farc rebels, but rejected by Colombians in a vote. Mr Santos said he dedicated the award to \"all the victims of the conflict\", and the Farc leader congratulated him. About 260,000 people have been killed and more than six million internally displaced in Colombia. The award did not include Farc leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, who also signed the accord. The head of the Nobel commitee said the award recognised the president's \"resolute efforts\" to end the conflict. The Nobel committee awarded the president. The award recognised the president's \"resolute efforts\". The president's efforts were to end the conflict. \"The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the  parties who have contributed to the peace process,\" Kaci Kullman Five added. Sources: BBC Monitoring, Colombian presidency. BBC Monitoring is a source. Colombian presidency is a source. Mr Santos said on Twitter: \"This honourable distinction is not for me, it's for all the victims of the conflict. Together we'll win the most important award of them all: peace.\" The peace deal was rejected by 50.2% of voters who went to the polls on 2 October. The committee acknowledged the result, saying: \"What the 'No' side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement.\" It also said that finding a balance between the need for reconciliation and ensuring justice for the victims would be a difficult challenge. Also on Twitter, Farc leader Timochenko said: \"I congratulate President Juan Manuel Santos, Cuba and Norway, who sponsored the process, and Venezuela and Chile, who assisted it, without them, peace would be impossible.\" Earlier, he had written: \"The only prize we aspire to is peace with social justice for Colombia, without (right-wing) paramilitary groups, without retaliation or lies. Peace in the streets.\" This was a Peace Prize for a peace deal that wasn't. President Santos joins a long line of Nobel Peace Prize winners who have been rewarded for effort as much as achievement. But it is too easy to be cynical. The Nobel Peace Prize has often been controversial. In recent years a variety of international bureaucracies have won - the EU, the IAEA and the OPCW. Why, some have argued, should people get a prize for simply doing their job? What, others ask, had US President Barack Obama actually done to merit the prize in 2009, other than be elected? But the Nobel has often gone to extraordinary individuals who really have gone above and beyond to bring peace - in Northern Ireland and East Timor to name just two examples. Maybe the award to President Santos may yet galvanise public opinion in Colombia to think again about the deal. Critics, led by former president Alvaro Uribe, said the deal was too lenient to the rebels. Under the agreement, special courts would have been created to try crimes committed during the conflict. Those who confessed would have received lighter sentences and avoided serving any time in conventional prisons. The Farc would also have been guaranteed 10 seats in the Colombian Congress in the 2018 and 2022 elections. Despite the rejection by voters, Mr Santos vowed to continue with talks with the rebels. Government negotiators have already returned to the Cuban capital Havana for further discussions with Farc leaders. Kaci Kullman Five, from the Nobel committee, said the award was also meant as \"encouragement\" to the rebels. \"Giving the prize to Santos is not a belittlement to any of the other parties. \"The Farc is obviously a very important part of this process.'' 1964: Set up as armed wing of Communist Party. 2002: At its height, it had an army of 20,000 fighters controlling up to a third of the country.

        "document": "Giving people the right to buy their council houses and shares in previously nationalised firms such as British Telecom and British Gas were among the initiatives that won her much support. But some believe that other changes, such as those that made mortgages and credit much easier to get, sowed the seeds of future crises that still affect many to this day. Here, BBC reporters look at some of the changes that, for better or worse, have changed our finances forever. By Brian Milligan, personal finance reporter, BBC News. The Right to Buy Scheme for council houses was one of Margaret Thatcher's most popular policies. It was enshrined in the Housing Act of 1980, making it one of her first major pieces of legislation after she came to office in 1979. The number of people who bought their council house from their local authorities rose to 200,000 by 1982, and again peaked at 180,000 in 1989, her last full year as prime minister. Since the Housing Act came into force, it is estimated that some two million homes have been sold to former council tenants. The sale price was based on market valuation, but included substantial discounts, depending on how long a tenant had been living there. When Labour came to power in 1997, it reduced the value of such discounts in areas where councils were running short of housing stock. Critics said the policy resulted in speculators buying up valuable housing stock too cheaply. The Right to Buy Scheme was extended in the March 2013 Budget, as the government vowed to increase sales once again. By Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent, BBC News. Before Mrs Thatcher arrived at No 10, British passports contained a special page to record the amount of cash travellers took out of the country. The page was one of the first things to be scrapped by the new government, as the Tories moved to abolish exchange controls. The Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, raised travel allowances to £1,000 per trip and permitted overseas property purchases of up to £100,000. On the tax front, the basic rate was cut by 3p to 30p in the pound, while the highest rate came down from 83p to 60p. But Thatcher's chancellors not only cut income tax, but also changed the way we pay tax. To fund lower taxes on incomes, up went tax on most things shoppers bought. VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8% to 15%. Within a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25%, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40%. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor. With money from tax cuts in their pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the \"feelgood factor\". They were encouraged further as credit was unleashed. Restrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s. And, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window. Building societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete. The Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years. Mrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988. The new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, they backfired. The promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions. Compensating the victims cost the pensions industry £11bn. More successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to £6,000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break. To complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax-free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa. The idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have £390bn salted away. By John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News. Few senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that her reforms had on the power of the movement. She was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as  collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike. The Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job. Secret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day. In 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million. The miners' strike of 1984-85 came to symbolise the government's battle with the unions. The year-long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police. In the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever. Unions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish their power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress-affiliated unions. One of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged. By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News. A policy of privatising the UK's large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such it was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had their critics. The recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership. By the end of its first term, it had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable & Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later. This led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK. One of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986. The promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to \"tell Sid\" about the chance to buy shares at \"affordable\" prices. Anyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid. Privatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. Privatisation was key. Privatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing. It also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies. Yet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s. In 1981, 28% was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20% by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11% by the end of 2010. By Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News. The impact of one of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK. One of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives had an impact. The impact was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK. The so-called \"Big Bang\", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange. The most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face. Big Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading. It also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen's club, ruled by restrictive practices. (It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.) Before Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor. Price competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm. At best it was a self-regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at its worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping. Big Bang saw many of the City's historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy  jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one-stop shops. This, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses. Big Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share-buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into their banks and order a parcel of shares. But while it made dealing and investing easier, it also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.",

The purpose of giving more power is to enable North Wales to work better with the north of England. \"From the discussions I've had in north Wales, the growth potential is enormous but it's more likely to be realised if we can work out those synergies between what's happening in north Wales and just the other side of the border. \"They need to be given the freedom by the Welsh assembly to do that.\" They need to be given the freedom. The freedom needs to be given by the Welsh assembly. The freedom is to do that. The cities of the \"Northern Powerhouse\" stretch from Manchester and Liverpool to Sheffield, Leeds and Hull and up to Newcastle and Sunderland in the north east. Radical improvements to transport connections over the next 15 to 20 years could create a single labour market and \"virtual city\" of 15 million in the north of England, which could provide an economic counter-balance to London. Sir Richard, who is also chair of the Core Cities cabinet which includes Cardiff, said north Wales could also benefit from that and there was a recognition in Cardiff Bay that the links between north Wales and northern England were more important than those with south Wales. Sir Richard said energy production, advanced manufacturing and health innovation and digital industries were not just based in the urban cores and some of these sectors already existed in north Wales. \"North Wales has the opportunity to play into and contribute to those sectoral strengths of the north of England. \"For industry in north Wales its route to market is through the North of England. So what we're do to improve transport connections, there's a shared interest in extending that beyond the north of England.\" He said care had to be taken with comparisons, as Wales had the same population as Greater Manchester but he said areas like transport and business support might benefit from greater devolution within Wales. Tracy North, chair of the CBI in north Wales said company owners and managers wanted to be involved with the Northern Powerhouse but there was not an obvious body or mechanism for doing so. \"The CBI wants the next Welsh government to create a regional development corporation for north Wales,\" she said. \"It would need to be set up immediately after the election. It would have funding and staff, run in partnership with business and be unencumbered by local red tape. \"This way, the north Wales region can act independently to optimise economic opportunities, without going through the impracticality of discussing and voting on devolution, which would out of necessity take years and years.\" A Wales Office spokesman said it was committed to delivering a fundamental shift of power from Westminster to the people and communities of this country and wanted the Welsh government to \"have the same confidence and faith in Wales\". \"Only by giving local areas the powers and freedom they need can we further drive economic growth and create the jobs and investment opportunities this country needs,\" he said. The Welsh government said: \"As part of the Mersey Dee Alliance, we already recognise the economic importance of cross border working and links. We will work with the UK Government to ensure north Wales has full potential to exploit the maximum economic advantage from any Northern Powerhouse proposals.\"",

Scientists have found that two types of chemicals called neonicotinoids and coumaphos are interfering with the insect's ability to learn and remember. Experiments revealed that exposure was also lowering brain activity, especially when the two pesticides were used in combination. Experiments were conducted. The experiments revealed something. The experiments were about exposure and brain activity. The exposure was lowering brain activity. The exposure was especially affecting brain activity when two pesticides were used together. The research is detailed in two papers in Nature Communications and the Journal of Experimental Biology. But a company that makes the substances said laboratory-based studies did not always apply to bees in the wild. And another report, published by the Defra's Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), concluded that there was no link between bee health and exposure to neonicotinoids. The government agency carried out a study looking at bumblebees living on the edges of fields treated with the chemicals. Falling numbers. Honey bees around the world are facing an uncertain future. They have been hit with a host of diseases, losses of habitat, and in the US the mysterious Colony Collapse Disorder has caused numbers to plummet. Now researchers are asking whether pesticides are also playing a role in their decline. To investigate, scientists looked at two common pesticides:  neonicotinoids, which are used to control pests on oil seed rape and other crops, and a group of organophosphate chemicals called coumaphos, which are used to kill the Varroa mite, a parasite that attacks the honey bee. Neonicotinoids are used more commonly in Europe, while coumaphos are more often employed in the United States. Work carried out by the University of Dundee, in Scotland, revealed that if the pesticides were applied directly to the brains of the pollinators, they caused a loss of brain activity. The University of Dundee carried out work on pesticides. The pesticides were applied directly to the brains of the pollinators. The application of pesticides caused a loss of brain activity. Dr Christopher Connolly said: \"We found neonicotinoids cause an immediate hyper-activation - so an epileptic type activity - this was proceeded by neuronal inactivation, where the brain goes quiet and cannot communicate any more. The same effects occur when we used organophosphates. \"And if we used them together, the effect was additive, so they added to the toxicity: the effect was greater when both were present.\" Another series of laboratory-based experiments, carried out at Newcastle University, examined the behaviour of the bees. The researchers there found that bees exposed to both pesticides were unable to learn and then remember floral smells associated with a sweet nectar reward - a skill that is essential for bees in search of food. Dr Sally Williamson said: \"It would imply that the bees are able to forage less effectively, they are less able to find and learn and remember and then communicate to their hive mates what the good sources of pollen and nectar are.\" 'No threat' She said that companies that are manufacturing the pesticides should take these findings into account when considering the safety of the chemicals. She explained: \"At the moment, the initial tests for bee toxicity are giving the bees an acute dose and then watching them to see if they die. \"But because bees do these complex learning tasks, they are very social animals and they have a complex behavioural repertoire, they don't need to be killed outright in order not to be affected.\" The European Commission recently called for a temporary moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids after a report by the European Food Safety Authority concluded that they posed a high acute risk to pollinators. But 14 out of the 27 EU nations - including the UK and Germany - opposed the ban, and the proposal has now been delayed. Ian Boyd, chief scientist at Defra, said: \"Decisions on the use of neonicotinoids must be based on sound scientific evidence.\" He said that the results of the Fera bumblebee study suggested that the extent of the impact might not be as high as some studies had suggested - and called for \"further data based on more realistic field trials is required\". He said that the results of the Fera bumblebee study. The results of the Fera bumblebee study suggested that the extent of the impact might not be as high as some studies had suggested. He called for further data based on more realistic field trials. He said that more realistic field trials are required. Dr Julian Little, communications and government affairs manager at Bayer Crop Science Limited, which makes some of the pesticides, said the findings of laboratory-based studies should not be automatically extrapolated to the field. \"If you take an insecticide and you give it directly to an insect, I can guarantee that you will have an effect - I am not at all surprised that this is what you will see,\" he explained. \"What is really important is seeing what happens in real situations - in real fields, in real bee colonies, in real bee hives, with real bee keepers.\"",

        "document": "MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer looks at the reasons why Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side won the Premier League by such a convincing margin and explains why it will be hard to stop them achieving more success. Every part of their team did their bit but the biggest reason for their success is one man, Jose Mourinho. His influence was huge. Media playback is not supported on this device. The Blues manager is a serial winner who lives for titles and trophies - and he knows exactly how to get what he wants. I don't accept the 'boring boring Chelsea' jibes his side have faced recently. I think that is utter rubbish. It is not Chelsea's problem if teams cannot beat them, and it is pretty embarrassing if they then call them boring. The only tag the Blues deserve is 'worthy champions' because that is what they are. Everyone else has a lot of catching up to do. One of the biggest reasons Chelsea won the title is that, unlike his rivals, Mourinho identified what he needed last summer, and went out and got it. I am sure he was hurt by what happened to Chelsea last season, his first back at Stamford Bridge since his last spell ended in 2007. Despite not having a really top-class centre-forward they went very close to winning the title. Near-misses don't mean anything to Mourinho, though. He addressed the main issue holding his side back by signing Diego Costa, who has scored the goals that were missing. Chelsea were also lacking a bit of guile in midfield, and Cesc Fabregas has provided the extra creativity there. His midfield partnership with Nemanja Matic, who Mourinho signed in January 2014 to sit and police the back four, is just one part of a team system that works perfectly. Chelsea have some top players, but their squad also has a great hunger and desire. Chelsea have some top players. Chelsea's squad has a great hunger and desire. That is down to their manager. By the end of the season, Chelsea will have broken the record for the most days spent on top of the table, and also the most consecutive days. They were joint-top with Manchester City at the start of January but, since they kicked their first ball of the campaign, the only time they have not been at the summit was after the second round of games. Their players had the character to deal with it. From August onwards, they have been the team to beat and the best team full-stop. That underlines their consistency over the last nine months, and shows the almost total control they have had on the title race. Even when they were hit for five by Tottenham on New Year's Day, no panic set in. That was one of their very few bad days, which are inevitable over a long season, but they never suffered a slump for a sustained period of time. They have never had to play catch-up in the title race and are not used to doing it in individual games either. Again, they are usually in control. They have scored the first goal in 27 out of their 35 league matches, which is obviously important for any team, but especially for Chelsea. When you have a defence like they do, they are very rarely pegged back when they get in front. I keep hearing that players need to be rested and rotated but Chelsea don't do it, and their approach seems to have helped rather than hindered them. Instead, Mourinho uses a core group of players who start whenever they are available. That includes Eden Hazard, who is hardly ever taken off either, something that is rare for an attacking player. At the back, John Terry has been magnificent and he has played every single minute of every league game. Media playback is not supported on this device. The rest of the back four - Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Cesar Azpilicueta - play whenever they are fit. Compare them to, say, Manchester City who chop and change their defence a lot and you can see the benefit of a settled unit who work relentlessly together. Chelsea have had 17 clean sheets out of 35 league games, and they have only conceded more than two goals twice. They were pretty good at the back in the first half of the season when they were scoring goals freely. Until 17 January, only Southampton had conceded fewer goals. But in the past few weeks when they have been more pragmatic in the way they have been getting results, they have been even better at the back. From August to January, Chelsea played some sparkling football and you only have to look at their attacking statistics to see that they were anything but dull. So they earned the right to play the way they have been in the last few weeks, when they have been protecting their lead at the top of the table. I put that change in approach down to form and fitness of some of their players, with Costa's absence being the obvious example. The important thing was that Chelsea kept winning, though, and they have done that. None of their rivals have managed it over the duration of the season and the way I would sum up this campaign is that Chelsea have been brilliant and the rest of the league has not been good enough - by quite a margin. City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool have all been disappointing, especially when you look at the money they have spent, because they are further away from Chelsea now than they have been for a while. Chelsea have done the job they set out to do at the start of the season, which is to win the title. They have the best defensive record in the Premier League and only City have scored more goals. They have the best defensive record in the Premier League. Only City have scored more goals. They also have the best player, Hazard. Put all of that together and I just cannot accept they are dull. They have not got the credit they deserve but I don't think that bothers Mourinho one iota. Media playback is not supported on this device. The only thing that matters to him is winning the Premier League, and he has done that with ease. He has his third title in English football, and now he will want more. He can get that with this Chelsea team, which certainly does not need much work done to it over the summer. I am pretty sure a centre-forward will be high on Mourinho's shopping list because we have seen how much they have missed Costa when he has been out. Also, Didier Drogba is 37 now and I am not sure how long he can keep going. But the main thing for Chelsea is that Mourinho is not going anywhere - while he is around, there are more trophies to come. Alan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

Satellite images show colonies moving their locations in years when the thin sea ice on which they habitually breed forms late or is absent. Scientists report the observations in the online journal Plos One. They reveal the birds travelling long distances to find alternative sites. These are further in towards the coast, up on the ice shelves - the thick slabs of glacier ice that jut out over the ocean. It is a surprise because these shelves are frequently faced with cliffs that may be tens of metres high in places. But somehow, the emperors find a way up to breed, and also to come and go as they forage for the seafood that will sustain their chicks. \"We thought that in years when the sea ice was bad, they just didn't breed, but they're clearly more adaptable than that,\" said lead author Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey. The emperor is the most southerly of the Antarctic penguin species and the only one to breed on sea ice in the southern winter. The emperor is a penguin species. The emperor is the most southerly penguin species. The emperor breeds on sea ice. The emperor breeds on sea ice in the southern winter. Their reliance on these thin seasonal marine floes as a reproductive platform, coupled with concern about how the patterns of Antarctic sea ice could change in a warming world, has led to the species being designated as \"near threatened\" on the IUCN red list. Currently, the extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing year by year, albeit slowly. The extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing. The extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing year by year. The extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing slowly. The coverage does however vary considerably by region, and climate computer models indicate any gains will very likely be reversed later this century. But this study on four colonies around the continent suggests emperors do have the capacity to meet and beat some of the challenges that may lie ahead. In the observations of Shackleton Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, for example, the penguins are seen to be very adept at finding the routes that allow them to get past a 30m-high cliff. \"When they go out from the colony to forage, they go down the steep cliff - the shortest route to the sea. We're not sure how they get down - they may slide down or jump down,\" Mr Fretwell told BBC News. \"But this cliff is too steep for them to climb back up and so they must return a different way, likely through an ice creek. This route is 5km longer and we know they take it because we can see their tracks in the satellite pictures.\" There is a big opportunity here to go study these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition. There is obviously some cost to going up on the ice shelves - they are windier and the birds must travel further to forage. If that cost was not there, they would habitually breed on the shelves rather than the temperamental thin floes. But how big this cost is and how beneficial is the observed adaptation in years of poor sea ice has yet to be properly established. Co-author Barbara Wienecke from the Australian Antarctic Division said: \"These new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals. However, we cannot assume that this behaviour is widespread in other penguin populations. \"The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment - from sea ice to ice shelf - in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected. \"We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos.",

        "document": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Ancient cities around the shores of the Mediterranean and Adriatic are on the front line, their stone streets squeezed full of summer visitors as budget airlines and giant cruise ships unload ever-growing armies of tourists. Take the Croatian city of Dubrovnik: a perfectly preserved historical miniature, carved from honey-coloured stone set in a sea of postcard blue. Around 1,500 people live within the walls of its Old City, custodians of cultural treasures left by everyone from the Romans and the Ostrogoths to the Venetians and the Habsburgs. On a busy day three modern cruise ships, each one the size of a floating apartment building, can disgorge five or six times that number of people into the city. They join the throngs of tourists staying in local hotels and in rooms rented over the internet, in streets where almost every elegant stone house has been converted into a B&B. The overall effect is Disneylandish - a sense that you meet no-one but other tourists or ice-cream sellers, tour guides, waiters, reception clerks and buskers who are there to keep the tourist wheels turning. Mark Thomas, who edits The Dubrovnik Times, explains the phenomenon like this. \"When I first got here, I'd stand back if I saw that people were taking photographs of each other. Now there are so many people that I know if I did that, I'd never get anywhere here.\" Dubrovnik has a particular problem because its ancient appeal has now been bolstered by that most modern of phenomena - the HBO mini-series. The city, unchanged for centuries, provides the main locations for Game of Thrones. Fans come on pilgrimages to visit the settings. One souvenir shop owner, who told me he doesn't watch the series himself, admitted he had Googled a couple of catchphrases to help attract customers. \"It does seem crazy,\" he admitted, \"to stand here when it's 35 degrees, shouting that 'Winter is Coming'.\" Dubrovnik is not alone in struggling to balance its need for tourists' money with the need to ensure that those tourists don't end up destroying the beauty they've come to see. The tiny Italian island of Capri has warned that it could \"explode\" under the pressure of the trade that sees as many as 15,000 visitors a day travelling by boat from the mainland, to visit its once-idyllic streets and squares. One local official told The Daily Telegraph: \"You can't fit a litre-and-a-half into a litre pot.\" Florence, Barcelona and some Greek islands like Santorini have suffered too, and it was perhaps Venice which experienced the problem first. Its population has been falling since the 1950s, effectively forced out by the hordes of cruise-ship visitors. Tourism, of course, remains essentially a good thing and in the developed world we nearly all do it. It means trade and cultural exchange and it's both a symbol of rising prosperity and a generator of future wealth. Part of the \"problem\" is that travellers from traditional sources like the UK, Germany and the USA are increasingly being joined by the new middle classes of countries like Russia, China and India. Add to that the issue of security, which means that many tourists feel safer in Europe than they do in alternative destinations like Tunisia, Turkey or Egypt, and it's hard to see the numbers falling any time soon. It will fall to local governments in places like Dubrovnik and Capri and Venice to find a way of reducing those growing pressures. It will fall to local governments. Local governments are in places like Dubrovnik and Capri and Venice. The task for local governments is to find a way of reducing growing pressures.

He said the inquiry was \"yet another process\" rather than progress towards helping people. Mr Findlay told BBC Scotland's Timeline programme how he had spoken publically before about what happened to him, but has not been contacted about giving evidence to the inquiry. He was abused by one of his teachers, who is no longer alive, at Aberlour House, a prep school for Gordonstoun private school in Moray which Mr Findlay went on to attend.

Mr Findlay went on to attend Gordonstoun private school. Mr Findlay was assaulted in his bed in a dormitory after being given what he described as a form of date rape drug. \"He fondled my genitalia. He put his head under the covers, He took photographs,\" said Mr Findlay of the attack. \"Once I was able to move afterwards I confronted him about it. I was convinced by him that I imagined it, that nothing happened.\" Mr Findlay said what happened to him as a child \"tainted\" his adult life, including work and personal relationships. On the inquiry, he said: \"I would love to say I have hope, however, it is yet another announcement of yet another inquiry and yet another process. \"I see actually no progression whatsoever with regards to any government or any school providing genuine help for victims of abuse. \"It is all very well saying 'yeah, we are looking into it', but for crying out loud it is about time you could just turn around and say instead of spending how ever much on inquiries why not just spend the money on helping the victims of this abuse.\" Gordonstoun is among boarding schools and other institutions involved in the investigation.

The spokesperson added: \"Last year, we introduced legislation to make it easier to take civil action against historic child abuse, and we also reviewing the child protection system to ensure it is as effective as it can be.\"",

The charge comes during a difficult time for Mr Trump, just ahead of next week's Wisconsin primary where he is neck-and-neck with Senator Ted Cruz. Earlier on Tuesday, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker endorsed Mr Cruz for president. Mr Trump will participate in a CNN town hall event on Tuesday night when all three Republican contenders will face questions. He is currently well ahead in the Republican race with 739 delegates to Cruz's 465.

Low interest rates are acting as a significant support for homeowners in general, and are likely to be helping to stave off low level arrears for stretched households in particular,\" said CML director general Paul Smee. \"As ever, we urge borrowers to think ahead to when interest rates rise, and to contact their lender without delay if they are in difficulty.

The ban has to be agreed by all EU nations at a summit on 18 February.

But it will have to be agreed by member states, as part of a wider package of reforms to Britain's relationship with the EU, and will only apply for a temporary period as an \"emergency brake\". If Mr Cameron can get a deal on his reform package in two weeks' time at the Brussels summit he is expected to call a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU in June.

The surge in migrants is expected in the next 12 months. Mr Cameron has suggested the \"emergency brake\" could come into effect within three months of the UK applying for it. Eric Pickles defended Mr Cameron's reform deal, on the BBC's Sunday Politics, saying: \"What we need to be clear is, we're not trying to prevent people moving inside the European Union.\" The reforms were instead aimed at preventing people gaining \"something for nothing\" by claiming UK benefits before contributing anything in tax. But Sir Eric. a Conservative former cabinet minister, said action was needed to prevent a surge of migrants: \"Clearly as part of the negotiations we have to ensure that that doesn't happen.\" Meanwhile, speculation is continuing about whether a big cabinet name will lead the campaign to take Britain out of the EU. The Mail on Sunday said Boris Johnson, who has previously said Britain could prosper outside the EU and suggested Mr Cameron's deal needed more work, has told a fellow Tory MP he had \"never been an 'outer'\". Bernard Jenkin, a leading member of Vote Leave, told the newspaper: \"He is genuinely torn but I hope he will change his mind because he is one of the few who understands that if we stay in, Britain will be in a weaker position than ever before.\" Other potential Tory \"outers\" include Justice Secretary Michael Gove and Employment Minister Priti Patel, who have said they will make their position clear when they have seen the final deal. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who according to the Mail on Sunday has described the deal to friends as a \"load of rubbish\" which would be challenged in the European courts, is also refusing to comment publicly until the deal is finalised. UKIP MP Douglas Carswell told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it \"would be wonderful\" to have a Eurosceptic cabinet minister fronting the exit campaign but it would welcome anyone who wants to join it. He refused to enter into the war of words between the rival groups vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign, but ruled out a merger between them saying they had fundamental differences. He said Leave.EU, which is backed by UKIP donor Arron Banks, wanted to focus on \"identity and immigration,\" while Vote Leave, which he supports, wants to put forward an \"optimistic, upbeat internationalist message\". A third group, Grassroots Out (GO), which was founded by two Conservative MPs and is backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Mr Banks, has said it is exploring whether it has enough cross-party support to make a bid to be the official Leave campaign. One of its founders, Peter Bone, told the Sunday Politics there were 42 different Eurosceptic groups working together under the cross-party GO \"umbrella,\" and it was possible for them all to to operate as \"one happy family\".",

Initially £60m of public money was pledged on planning for the bridge. Transport for London pledged £30m, but £20m of that was to be a loan, and the rest was from central government. Dame Margaret says £37.4m had already been spent, and even if the bridge did not go ahead it would cost the taxpayer £46.4m. Dame Margaret says £37.4m had already been spent. £46.4m is the estimated cost for the taxpayer. The bridge is mentioned as a possible project. The Garden Bridge Trust said it was seeking a meeting with the London mayor to discuss next steps, but added the trust was \"determined\" to make the bridge happen. Dame Margaret, the MP for Barking and Dagenham and former chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee was asked to examine the project by London Mayor, Sadiq Khan in September. On Friday, Dame Margaret said: \"Value for money for the taxpayer has not been secured. \"It would be better for the taxpayer to accept the financial loss of cancelling the project than to risk the potential uncertain additional costs to the public purse if the project proceeds.\" Dame Margaret said decisions on the Garden Bridge were driven more by electoral cycles than value for taxpayers' money. Her review also found costs spiralling out of control from an early estimate of £60m to over £200m now. Moreover, the review found the \"risk to the taxpayer has intensified\", while the original ambition to \"fund the Garden Bridge through private finance has been abandoned\". Other findings include:. Dame Margaret's review criticised the tendering process for the design of the Garden Bridge created by the previous City Hall administration. It stated architects the Heatherwick Studio were given a head start in the process having already been closely associated with the project for five months before invitations to tender were sent out. Two other firms that took part in the tendering process - Wilkinson Eyre and Marks Barfield - were given just eight working days to submit designs, the review said. David Marks, co-director of Marks Barfield, told the BBC: \"This competition didn't smell right from the start. It is clear that we were just there to make up the numbers and the outcome of this tender had in reality already been pre-determined. \"Had Marks Barfield been aware of Heatherwick Studios' involvement and original idea, we would certainly not have submitted a tender. \"We've never been asked to do something in such a short space of time.\" This is 40 pages of brutal, uncompromising criticism of nearly every part of the once flagship Garden Bridge project. I can't remember reading a report so damning of a transport project. Procurement, finances, business cases, value for money, previous mayors, deputy mayors and transport officials get an absolutely withering assessment. This was meant to be an oasis of green calm hanging above the Thames. Now a report has basically recommended it be cancelled and the taxpayer take a hit on a project whose overall cost is now upwards of £200m. It will be very difficult for the project to withstand this. The big question now is will the present Mayor Sadiq Khan just let it wither or kill it? Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Garden Bridge Trust, said: \"We will be studying the report in detail and seeking a meeting with the mayor to discuss next steps. \"The Trust remains as determined as ever to make the Garden Bridge happen which will bring huge benefits to London and the UK.\" A City Hall spokesman said: \"The Mayor has been absolutely clear that he will not spend any more of London taxpayers' funds on the Garden Bridge. \"It is the Garden Bridge Trust that remains responsible for raising the necessary funds, and delivering the project.\" The Garden Bridge Trust is responsible for raising funds. The Garden Bridge Trust is responsible for delivering the project.",

The findings, reported in the journal Science, could lead to cheaper and greener cars, planes and electronics. It is the first time that durable \"thermoset\" plastic has been produced in a recyclable form. Dr Jeanette Garcia, from IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, stumbled upon the first new class of thermosets in many years when she accidentally left one of three components out of a reaction. \"I had this chunk of plastic, and I had to figure out what it was,\" Dr Garcia told the BBC. \"I had to smash my round-bottomed flask with a hammer.\" That chunk of plastic, produced from unexpectedly simple ingredients, proved to be tremendously hard and stable. Crucially, it could be digested in acid, reverting to its original components. This digestion reaction allows the chemical building blocks, or monomers, to be reused. \"It was definitely fortuitous,\" Dr Garcia said. \"The first thing I did, of course, was to hit the literature, to try and see if it'd been done before. I just assumed that it had been - it's such a simple reaction.\" But her search turned up nothing. This was new. Once she understood what she had created, Dr Garcia set about repeating her finding. \"We wasted a lot of flasks,\" she said. Because they are strong and light-weight, thermosets are used throughout modern cars and aircraft, often mixed with carbon fibres to form composites. Some 50% of the new Airbus A350 jet, for example, will be made from composites. Yet until now, none of this thermoset plastic could be recycled. Thermoset plastic is a type of plastic. Thermoset plastic cannot be recycled until now. \"The potential impact here is phenomenal,\" said Dr Charl Faul, a materials chemist at the University of Bristol. He says the study offers a \"very simple, elegant answer to a very old problem\". Dr James Hedrick, who was in charge of the research at IBM, is excited by the possiblities. When a large or expensive component is damaged or reaches the end of its useful life, he explained, it could be repaired or recycled instead of thrown away. \"The ability to rework saves a tremendous amount of money and mitigates waste.\" Beyond replacing thermoset-based composites in current technology, Dr Hedrick sees the potential for many more innovative applications. \"We're at the discovery phase,\" he said. \"Every time you discover a new polymer-forming reaction it leads to all sorts of new materials.\" The statement is about polymer-forming reactions. The statement is about the discovery of new materials. The statement implies that each new polymer-forming reaction leads to new materials. As well as very hard and durable plastics, the researchers adapted their procedure to a different monomer and produced flexible, self-healing gels. These could be useful in anything from cosmetics, to paint, to the design of drug capsules, because of their particular solubility properties. \"Applications are running like water,\" Dr Hedrick said. \"We don't even know where to go with this yet.\"",

The plan was related to the leadership election result. The leadership election result was expected on Saturday. The proposal was voted down by 16 votes to 15. Mr Corbyn was among those to vote against it, but did agree to further talks with Mr Watson and other senior figures before the next NEC meeting this weekend, at the party's conference in Liverpool. Mr Watson said afterwards that it was a \"very positive meeting\". He added: \"We agreed 22 changes to our rules and guidance, all sorts of positive things I'm sure the media will be really interested in.\" Many MPs see elections as a way of constraining Mr Corbyn, should he be re-elected as leader, and ensuring a balance of opinion at Labour's top table. Supporters of Mr Corbyn say any plan should call for party members and activists to also have a say in any elections. The Labour leader has said there is a \"thirst for democracy\" in the party and he backs a \"widening of the franchise\". Mr Watson also called for Labour's leadership election rules to be changed to exclude registered supporters who pay a one-off fee to vote. He described their participation as \"unpopular\" and suggested a return to a franchise of party members, trade unionists and MPs. In last year's contest, 84% of the 105,598 registered supporters who paid Â£3 to vote backed Jeremy Corbyn. This time around, they were asked to pay Â£25 to take part. Despite the increased fee, 129,000 people are thought to have applied successfully for a one-off vote in the contest between Mr Corbyn and his challenger Owen Smith - the result of which will be announced on Saturday. Registered supporters were given a say in the choice of leader as a result of changes brought in by Ed Miliband, and approved by the party in 2013, designed to open up the process to a wider audience. Critics have said it allowed the leadership election to be hijacked by far-left groups with their own agenda - although Mr Corbyn easily won the most support among all groups - including party members, trade unionists and other affiliated supporters. Mr Watson, who himself was elected deputy leader last year using the same franchise, said the reforms had been \"rushed\" and \"unpopular\". He suggested a return to the previous system used to elect Mr Miliband and his predecessors - in which voting was limited to an electoral college of party members, trade unionists, affiliate supporters and elected representatives of the party. \"We created a new category of member - a registered supporter - that was pretty unpopular in all sections. We want to remove that and we want also want to enfranchise ordinary trade unionists in the process,\" he said. Mr Watson said he did not want the changes to be seen as a threat to Mr Corbyn and suggested they would only apply after he stood down, whenever that may be. But the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the move would be seen as an attempt to make it much harder for a left winger like Mr Corbyn to be elected.

        "document": "The 51-year-old London mayor has spent more than a decade combining the gravitas of his various roles with an unkempt, humorous persona rarely seen in modern public life. Prime Minister David Cameron expressed his delight when Mr Johnson announced his decision to run for parliament again in 2015, saying: \"I want my star players on the pitch.\" But now the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has said he will campaign against the PM in the EU referendum, relations between the two may become more tense. The big question is whether the blond-haired old Etonian wants simply to play for the team or to captain it. He has arguably the highest profile of any Conservative except Mr Cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister. When he beat Labour's Ken Livingstone to become London mayor in 2008 it was the Tories' first high-profile election success since before Tony Blair's triumphant entry into Downing Street in 1997. He defeated Mr Livingstone again in 2012, giving him even more of a winner's aura. The hoopla surrounding Mr Johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the Commons as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. He swept into the safe Conservative London seat in the 2015 general election, taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio. Given the opportunity to enter Downing Street on a fortnightly basis, cycle helmet in hand, was seen as recognition for his unique rapport with voters. But crucially he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility, giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign. Although lauded by Conservative activists for his witty speeches, Euroscepticism and lack of PR polish, Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free. Mr Johnson is a Conservative activist. Mr Johnson is known for his witty speeches. Mr Johnson is a Eurosceptic. Mr Johnson lacks PR polish. Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free. In 2004 he had to make a visit to Liverpool to apologise for an article in the Spectator magazine, which he then edited. It had criticised the people of the city for their reaction to the death of Ken Bigley, the British contractor taken hostage and killed in Iraq. The following month he was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims he had an affair. He created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when he attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. He said he would like to \"get rid of [him] and tell people to eat what they like\". Later he provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as \"too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs\" and associating Papua New Guinea \"with orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing\". The London mayor's life has been as exotic as his use of language. The London mayor has a life that is exotic. The London mayor uses exotic language. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and he held US citizenship until 2006. Descended from Turkish, French and German stock he describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\". His great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, briefly served as an interior minister in the Ottoman Empire. The son of a diplomat and Conservative Member of the European Parliament, he was educated at Eton College, where he was senior to Mr Cameron. There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson's part at being overtaken by his younger rival. At Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre-left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant he moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, he then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as its Brussels correspondent and assistant editor. In his seven years as MP for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 he did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice-chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture. His decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign he made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as he beat Mr Livingstone by 54% to 47%. Days after his victory he banned alcohol consumption on public transport. A keen cyclist himself, he launched a central London bicycle hire scheme, known colloquially as \"Boris bikes\", and ditched the \"bendy bus\" in favour of a new generation of double-deckers. Although suffering a series of high-profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair's departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said he was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson. He was in charge when riots hit the capital in the summer of 2011. Initially criticised for taking too long to return from a holiday, he was later praised for his handling of events, including making tours of the affected areas. Mr Johnson also represented the city when it received its greatest publicity in decades, during the 2012 Olympics. His speeches were well received but he was a little embarrassed when, at one promotional event, he became caught on a zipwire, to the delight of photographers. In 2011 he told the BBC's Newsnight he did not expect to do \"another big job in politics\" after leaving the mayoralty. This was not universally accepted at face value. Mr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about his ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond his remit in London, in particular on Europe. Mr Johnson has made speeches.

The first funeral has taken place, for Raghavendran Ganeshan, whose body was returned to the Indian city of Chennai on Tuesday. The discovery of the computer emerged the day after the Brussels attacks. It had been abandoned in a bin in Max Roos street in the Brussels area of Schaerbeek. The three suspects captured on airport CCTV had left a house on the same street by taxi and the driver had later guided police to the address, where explosive materials were found. Quoting reliable sources, De Tijd newspaper said earlier that files on the computer contained details and photos of the prime minister's building and office at 16 Rue de la Loi (Wetstraat in Dutch) as well as details of his official residence in Lambermont street. It is unclear if these were downloaded from the internet or taken by the bombers themselves. A spokesman for Mr Michel said security had been strengthened well before the attacks last week because of concerns the buildings were vulnerable. The chancellery is also next door to the US embassy and on the same street as Maelbeek metro station, where Ibrahim el-Bakraoui's brother blew himself up little over an hour after the airport attack.

Chief executive Arnaud Feist has said it will take months to reopen fully, as the departures hall will have to be rebuilt \"from the air conditioning to the check-in desks\". Several airlines have diverted flights to Liege, Antwerp Ostend and Charleroi. However, Brussels Airlines is running only 40% of its flights and says it is losing €5m a day because of the closure of Brussels airport. In a separate development, an open letter written by police at the airport has been published by Belgian broadcaster VRT, in which they express frustration and say security was not taken seriously enough. They complain of a shortage of staff and say the airport's \"open infrastructure\" meant that trains, buses and cars were able to approach and leave the airport without any control.",

I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blasé attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation. He is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web. To some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet. To others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted. Dingledine would rather we talked about the latter. Dingledine has a preference. Dingledine would rather talk about something else. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues. But we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas. The timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (£0.7bn) a year in revenue. Dingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web. \"I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,\" he tells me, \"where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article. \"The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story.\" The Tor Project's website has a section called \"Abuse FAQ\". It is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes. When talking about this, Dingledine invokes the \"guns don't kill people\" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do. \"I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things. \"It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists.\" I guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online. \"I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,\" Dingledine insists. Dingledine has an opinion about the bad stuff on the internet. Dingledine thinks that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor. Dingledine insists on his opinion. \"Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there.\" In layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track. There have been rumours that law enforcement has \"cracked\" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid. \"As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor]. \"Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect.\" Any major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing. \"Which is frustrating,\" Dingledine interjects, \"Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy.\" Tor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading \"Tor Stinks… but it could be worse\", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: \"We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time.\" Given this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties. He is confident that funding will continue. He is confident. He is confident about funding. He is confident that funding will continue. \"A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet.\" The reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in. In 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month. \"About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely,\" Dingledine says. \"Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing…. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase.\" The ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online. But given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing. \"I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries,\" he says. ___________.

It was also a blow to the State Department, and to diplomacy. It was a blow to the State Department. It was a blow to diplomacy. How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this, as on other issues, Tillerson kept a low profile. Twenty-four hours after the decision, the only comment he'd made was an aside at a photo-opportunity. A decision was made. Twenty-four hours after the decision, the only comment was made. The comment was made at a photo-opportunity. He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things \"in perspective\". Tillerson had previously said the US should \"maintain its seat at the table\" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement. But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president's daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super-engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony. Mr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday-act-of-resistance, we don't know. A State Department official said only that he was in his office and \"maintained his schedule, preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand\". No doubt Pruitt (and his ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments. But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. He's already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department. And the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than he does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House. Clearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement. Where it once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, it's now been dropped off the map. The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement. Finally, it's a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck. \"We have now slapped every country in the world in the face,\" says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration. \"We've said we know this matters to you a lot, we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable, but we drop out. It's the worst way you could treat other countries.\" To be fair, this is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush's decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty. But it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what's going on. So while this will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends. Follow Barbara on Twitter.",

A total of 225 jobs are threatened at the Dalzell plate-rolling works in Motherwell, along with 45 posts at the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang. The company blames cheap Chinese imports and high energy costs for a collapse in steel prices. The Scottish government has assembled a taskforce to try to guarantee a future for the plants. Community union representative Derek Fearon said: \"We are trying to raise awareness of the campaign, and hopefully through this Tata will become a responsible seller. \"The main aim of the taskforce, the priority of it, is for the two plants to remain open. \"The mood is upbeat, the guys are still positive that everything can be done for the two plants to be saved.\" The Scottish government has pledged to do everything possible to keep the plants operational, with its preferred option being to find a buyer. However, ministers have not ruled out moves to bring both facilities under public ownership. A Scottish Steel Task Force, chaired by business minister Fergus Ewing, and including representatives from trade unions and Tata, as well as local councils, met last week to discuss the way forward. Motherwell and Wishaw MSP John Pentland, himself a former steelworker, has welcomed the creation of the task force and called for all avenues to be explored to keep the plants open. He said: \"The starting point for the Scottish Task Force should be saving the steel plants and all the jobs, not softening the blow. \"We should not meekly accept the annihilation of the Scottish steel industry. The speaker is against the annihilation of the Scottish steel industry. The speaker is urging action to prevent the annihilation of the Scottish steel industry. We don't want consolation measures such as retraining for other jobs that don't exist. There are other options that will protect the industry and its jobs. \"I believe Scottish steel can have a future, and we must consider all the options to achieve that, including public ownership, which doesn't rely on Westminster anymore.\"",
